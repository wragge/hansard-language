<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Health: Is it a fact that under the proposed Government health scheme a worker supporting a wife and earning $42.50 a week will receive full cover but a worker supporting a wife and 5 <span class="highlight">children</span> and earning $48.76 a week will receive but two-thirds of the full cover? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister state whether this yacht, which carried young <span class="highlight">children</span>, was structurally and by design capable of safe sea passage in the type of conditions which it may reasonably have been expected to encounter on a Pacific Ocean cruise? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Something like 1,000 Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> go to a school on Penang Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be deplorable, shameful and wicked if photographs were taken of curious <span class="highlight">children</span> - 1 put it at that level because they would be curious to know what it was all about and they would have no significant understanding of it - with a background of a Vietcong flag, the flag of our enemy, and also of the Australian parliamentary building, and such photographs were used in the manner suggested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Does she now tell the Senate that she does not know, and she has not got information, as to whether legal proceedings have been commenced by the father in England, and yet a decision has been taken to deport  Mrs Taylor  and her <span class="highlight">children</span> from Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the Minister give the same consideration to  Mrs Taylor  as was given to  Mrs Biggs,  by making a thorough investigation as to the welfare of the <span class="highlight">children</span> and taking appropriate action in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Were the <span class="highlight">children</span> now being sought by the father being supported by the father immediately before their departure from England? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Acting Minister for Immigration examined the possible future in England for  Mrs Barbara  Taylor and more particularly her 2 innocent <span class="highlight">children</span> as a result of the Government’s enforcing an order for her deportation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the future welfare of the <span class="highlight">children</span> will be belter served by residence in Australia, no matter what sin one of the parents has committed, will the Minister temper justice with mercy and withdraw the deportation order? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister also aware that for many <span class="highlight">children</span>, especially <span class="highlight">children</span> of poverty, lack of intellectual stimulus preordains failure in later life? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to psychological studies conducted in the United States, either of <span class="highlight">children</span> aged from 1 year to 4 years or from 4 years to 8 years, [ confess a complete absence of knowledge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think it is a loathsome thing for <span class="highlight">children</span> to be assaulted by perverts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Has the Minister received a further request from citrus growers in Western Australia for orange juice to be provided to school <span class="highlight">children</span> when desired in lieu of free milk? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I may add that orange juice might be more suitable to <span class="highlight">children</span> who live in areas where it is very difficult to transport milk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Health, although I think my question involves the Minister for Social Services also, ls the Minister aware that, according to the  President  of the Association of Victorian Homes and Hospitals for the Aged, which Association covers 32 homes, the Chief Executive of the Church of England Diocesan Mission, the Catholic Vicar for Social Welfare and the Manager of the Salvation Army Social Services Department, homes and hospitals for the aged and <span class="highlight">children</span> in Victoria are, due to inflation, critically short of funds and in most cases are reducing their services and the number of their patients? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has the Australian Broadcasting Control Board done to ensure that greater opportunity  is  taken by commercial television stations to develop a wider range of Australian programmes, of both an entertaining and informative character,  to  interest <span class="highlight">children</span> and adolescents during family viewing times? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for External Territories: Was a 9-year-old Papuan boy sentenced to 6 months gaol on each of 4 charges in the Port Moresby <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Court last Friday, and did the magistrate direct that this 2-year sentence be served in Bomana Gaol as there is no reformatory for juvenile offenders? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the many church appeals by all denominations for winter relief for the poor, stressing particularly the needs of deserted wives and <span class="highlight">children</span>, will the Minister appoint within his Department in each State a representative in the form of an ombudsman with the finance and power to act immediately with church or relief organisations to give assistance to any persons, particularly women and <span class="highlight">children</span>, found to be suffering from hunger, cold or poverty during this coming winter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of the serious deterioration of the situation in the last 4 weeks which has resulted in the certain death of 100,000 <span class="highlight">children</span> and which endangers the lives of a further 100,000 <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the situation in which people could go out armed for the purpose of killing for personal gain and there is the situation in which innocent people - <span class="highlight">children</span> or women - could be subjected to harm and death in a way which I feel has to be met with a rather harsh and strong penalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of  Mr O’Lear’s  deportation from Australia was met by the Department of Immigration, but the question of the cost of the repatriation of  Mrs O’Lear  and the 1 1 <span class="highlight">children</span> on Friday next is still under consideration with the American authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we recognise India’s outstanding contributions in providing as far as possible, for their immediate needs, we consider that this is a problem for all mankind to help solve, as there are eight million people, many of them helpless <span class="highlight">children</span>, affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711028_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>which the Commonwealth should make to the Slates to assist in meeting the requirements of all school-age <span class="highlight">children</span> on the basis of needs and priorities, and in making recommendations for such grants to the States, the Commission shall hav regard to: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the primary obligation of governments to provide and maintain government school systems of the highest standard open to all <span class="highlight">children</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of statements suggesting that the Government favours more creches and child minding centres, will the Government consider financing home help facilities to assist mothers who for health or other good reasons need help with young families so that the <span class="highlight">children</span> can be kept in the home? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister representing the Minister for Customs and Excise recognise that textbooks for school <span class="highlight">children</span> are an integral but expensive part of our education requirements? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Commonwealth give special assistance to <span class="highlight">children</span> living in isolated areas of the Northern Territory in order that they might gain a full education; if so, what form does such assistance take and what is the annual cost? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-82-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Changes were made in the Social Services Bill last year in which particularly payments for the second, third and subsequent <span class="highlight">children</span> were increased from $2.50 to $4.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, it seems distinctly odd to me that, in a partnership which may consist of a husband, wife and 2 or 3 <span class="highlight">children</span> running a farm which has 200 hives of bees on it, each of those partners would be entitled to a vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Means as assessed’ in the case of an age or invalid pensioner, or a widow pensioner without dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>, consist of the pensioner’s annual rate of income plus a property component equal to $2 for each $20 of property above $400; in the case of a widow pensioner with dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>, no property component is counted if property does not exceed $4,500. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, income from property, payments received from <span class="highlight">children</span>, the value of the pensioner’s home, furniture and personal effects, including a car used for private purposes, are disregarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As school journals can be regarded as assisting and furthering the educational opportunities of students and school <span class="highlight">children</span>, will the Postmaster-General consider giving free postal facilities to certain journals and publications of school organisations which are distributed by schools, thus saving much needed funds that could be used for other educational facilities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The means by which ‘isolated school chil dren’, that is, <span class="highlight">children</span> who for geographic reasons have no reasonable daily access to an appropriate school - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The means by which these disabilities can be overcome whether by an extension and deployment more widely of schools or institutes of tertiary education, the provision of financial aid to such <span class="highlight">children</span> or otherwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he read or listened to my speech the other week, he would know that I agree that it is an anomaly that charities should get a testamentary gift free of duty whereas a man’s widow and dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> have to pay duty to get their share. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the present time the situation is that in many cases throughout Australia a man leaves a section of his estate to charities, perhaps with the object in mind of reducing the burden of duty on his widow and <span class="highlight">children</span>, and in most cases the charities receive cash and the widow and <span class="highlight">children</span> are left with property on which they have to try to raise cash to pay estate duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why do the terms of reference, published on 21 August 1974 by the Minister, confine themselves to matters of sexual practice, abortion and related matters, and do not specifically include concern for the rights of <span class="highlight">children</span> and for human life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to the question without notice asked by  Senator Bonner  on 4 December 1974, the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs stated inter alia that there were no indications of an outbreak of gastro-enteritis at Wilcannia at that time and that ‘five Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> were admitted to the Broken Hill hospital last week but the doctor said that the pathology tests showed that they had measles’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>that the <span class="highlight">children</span> were not suffering from gastro-enteritis, was entirely correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Minister say recently that, ‘Some Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> were reaching high school without being able to read’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In response to the matter raised by  Senator Knight  relating to the provision of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services, I take the point that he wished to clarify statements that had been made in regard to the Government’s present programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1975, in the course of a case before the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Court when a child was being deemed neglected, evidence was given that she had been beaten by her mother’s de facto husband. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-47-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Child Welfare Ordinance 1957 the Director of Child Welfare has responsibility for matters affecting <span class="highlight">children</span> and so action in relation to child bashing can be a joint enterprise between the Welfare Branch of the Department of the Capital Territory, the Police and Health and allied services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the remarks made by  Senator Baume  I wonder whether he is aware that there appears to be a growing school of thought among medical practitioners that <span class="highlight">children</span> who suffer from croup should not have any dairy foods at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was a little concerned that  Senator Baume  said that <span class="highlight">children</span> can go without milk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not talking only about <span class="highlight">children</span> going without milk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite often doctors prescribe cows’ milk substitutes to take over where the dairy foods would normally be provided in the diet of some <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The need for the continuation and extension of projects undertaken by or proposed to the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission such as: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has there been a considerable down-turn in school attendance by Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> in the Northern Territory; if so, what has caused this trend, and what action is envisaged to improve attendance at schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The existing application form for the grant of citizenship was designed with brevity and simplicity in mind and with the object of obtaining additional essential information including the details of <span class="highlight">children</span> at interview. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would be some advantages from the management side if applicants had to specify in their applications the names of <span class="highlight">children</span> under sixteen years they wished to have included in their certificates of citizenship but this would not have relevancy to the facility with which evidentiary certificates for such <span class="highlight">children</span> are at present issued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>and (2) I have been advised by the Office of the Interim Committee for the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission that assistance has been approved to organisations in the four areas of Sydney nominated by the honourable senator, as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-12">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister considered a change in the format of the existing application form for citizenship which would provide a place for the names of <span class="highlight">children</span> of applicants born outside Australia; if so, would it facilitate the issue of evidentiary certificates for such <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Government’s action is responsible for a severe increase in the cost of cows’ milk substitutes which penalise parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> aged eighteen months and over who have a medical need for these substitutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Is it a fact that if the Family Law Court makes an order for reasonable access to the child or <span class="highlight">children</span> of a separated couple where the wife has custody and the husband applies for access, the only way the husband can enforce this order is again to apply to the Court for it to enforce the order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-88-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs aware that  Dr L.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like a further explanation of the assertion that has been made in regard to the Government’s refusal to support a program that would prevent the deaths of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The number of <span class="highlight">children</span> not born in Australia would be very limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the <span class="highlight">children</span> of supporting mothers or supporting fathers who would be excluded from this benefit under the provisions in the Bill would be very minimal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The residence qualification for the supporting mother’s benefit, when it was introduced, related to <span class="highlight">children</span> who were born in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is accepted that the benefits should cover <span class="highlight">children</span> born in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for the difference between the widow and the widower is that it was not intended that a class A widower’s pension would be available to the widower in the way that a class A widow’s pension is available even if there are no dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> under the age of 16 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For those who have been supporting their <span class="highlight">children</span> for six months or more, the supporting parent’s benefit will become available immediately this Bill is passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to be told why the <span class="highlight">children</span> have to be born in Australia before the parent qualifies to claim the benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a great deal of discussion in Queensland about this program, and I am sure that most parents who are interested in the welfare of their <span class="highlight">children</span> at school, as well as many educationists, are not fully aware of the content of the material or the way that the program has been developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I shall draw to the attention of the Minister for Health the question raised by the honourable senator and his suggestion that further steps should be taken to see that as many young girls and women of child bearing age as possible do have immunisation against rubella because of the disastrous consequences for newly-born <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given that rubella accounts for 90 per cent of deaf-blind <span class="highlight">children</span> and 35 per cent of congenitally deaf <span class="highlight">children</span>, does the Minister believe that the existing voluntary scheme of rubella vaccination is a satisfactory one, or is she of the opinion that an insufficient number of people offer themselves for immunisation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would draw the honourable senator’s attention to the fact that the figures quoted make no allowance either for the additional $50m which will be provided for TAFE capital programs in the next biennium or for the additional funds which will be made available for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the involvement of the nursing profession with <span class="highlight">children</span> and its strong desire to take part and contribute, will the Minister give further consideration to inviting an appropriate representative of the nursing profession to join the national committee on non-government organisations relating to the International Year of the Child? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, regardless of where administrative responsibility should lie the Prime Minister has announced the Government’s intention to ensure that the cost to parents of educating handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> should not be greater than the cost of educating other <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>and (c) These recommendations of the National Advisory Council for the Handicapped concern the education of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> and were referred to my colleague the Minister for Education,  Senator the Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He has advised me that the Schools Commission has begun a wide ranging national survey of special education provision, and that the Council’s recommendation relating to information about the education of <span class="highlight">children</span> in State institutions will be kept in mind in the course of conducting the survey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Carrick also advises that authorities in the States responsible for the administration of Schools Commission Special Education funds make allocations for services to <span class="highlight">children</span> in hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Funds have also been made available since 1 977 under the <span class="highlight">Children</span> in Residential Institutions Program to bring life experience for <span class="highlight">children</span> living in institutions closer to that of other <span class="highlight">children</span> and to enable institutions to provide the support some <span class="highlight">children</span> need in their formal education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the education of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> should be the responsibility of education authorities and accordingly should be funded from that source rather than through the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Schools Commission take urgent action to ascertain the number of <span class="highlight">children</span> in State institutions where no adequate educational facilities are available; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Commission allocate funds in 1978 for educational programs for such <span class="highlight">children</span>- this group including <span class="highlight">children</span> and adolescents with severe and profound handicaps (usually including mental retardation) who are resident in hospital units, training centres and other State institutions, in the age range from birth to 18 years, and including people who have already acquired basic academic skills prior to admission to an institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A woman who has <span class="highlight">children</span> and who is divorced in Australia becomes eligible under our social security system for a pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The allowances that are paid for her <span class="highlight">children</span> are portable with that pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 3 amends section 1 8A of the principal Act to put an upper limit of 25 years of age on student <span class="highlight">children</span> for whom a handicapped child’s allowance can be paid under this section of the legislation to age and invalid pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the only reason given for this is to make uniform the provisions in the Act regarding <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has some investigation been undertaken to find out how many people over the age of 25 years in this situation are considered to be <span class="highlight">children</span> and receiving benefits so that we can get some idea of how many people are affected by this clause and similar clauses throughout the legislation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for Social Security: Is it true that <span class="highlight">children</span> with coeliac disease have been accepted as being eligible for the handicapped child’s allowance of $15 a week when, in the absence of any other handicap, the only disadvantage they incur is the need to avoid wheat and rye products in their diet in order to enjoy normal health? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister agree that the philosophy behind the original legislation for the handicapped child’s allowance was to recompense parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> with handicaps such as cerebral palsy and mental retardation, whose care required both financial effort and effort of time and emotional stress? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications whether it is correct that some hundreds of copies of a potentially valuable report on the television viewing habits of Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>, produced by the research unit of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and printed by the Australian Government Publishing Service, have recently been pulped at the direct order of  Mr Bruce  Gyngell, the  Chairman  of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790503_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did it deal with such questions as the effect of advertising in <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs, the amount of time spent by <span class="highlight">children</span> viewing programs and also with complaints made by parents about advertising in <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790503_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a parent of young Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> I am concerned about those boys who are now 14 or 15 years of age and who, if the Government’s policy is allowed to go on and on, will be in Vietnam in 4 or 5 years time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that honourable senators opposite would not agree with that philosophy because fundamental to much of the philosophy of the Socialists is the fact that estates should be broken up; that there seems to be something inherently wicked in a man accruing assets in his lifetime and passing them on to his beneficiaries - his widow or <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I belong to a Party the political philosophy of which is that people should be entitled to own property; that they should be encouraged to accumulate property, and that 1 of the great incentives to accumulating property is that one is able to pass it on to beneficiaries, to a wife or to <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate may or may not recall that I last spoke on this measure on Thursday, 7th May, and when the sitting was suspended at 5.45 p.m., for the dinner adjournment, I was arguing that one of the fundamental differences in the approach to death duties or estate duties - call them what you wish - between honourable senators who sit on this side of the chamber and the members of the Australian Labor Party who sit on the other is their approach to whether or not a man, through thrift and initiative in his own lifetime, should be able to acquire an estate or to acquire assets and to pass them on to his beneficiaries, be they his wife or his <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is one pf the reasons why I am philosophically opposed to the imposition of death duties especially where they bear heavily on the <span class="highlight">children</span> who have worked for often very little reward in their lifetime in the expectation of inheriting the estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For many years we have been crying out about the basic educational needs of the people and their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is no suggestion of any alleviation of the burden of costs of parents who today will tell you of the burdensome financial requirements in providing dental care and treatment for their <span class="highlight">children</span>’s teeth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Despite their comments about Aboriginal housing and education, you won’t find them engaged in the difficult task of trying to educate these <span class="highlight">children</span> who live in an environment not conducive to rapid eduction, or attemtping the frustrating task of training Aboriginals to occupy accommodation quite foreign to them, in fact their habitat is not the habitat and their endeavours not the endeavours of the people whom they ‘rubbish’ despite the inference that they have the answers to all these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In recent years we have had examples of the Government using the taxpayers’ money to inform school <span class="highlight">children</span> of the Government’s attitude to Australian troops being in Vietnam and giving reasons why Australian conscripts are being called up to serve in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With communications the way they are today and with rapid transport, particularly from Indonesia, where there is practically a continuous epidemic of smallpox, I had my <span class="highlight">children</span> vaccinated or immunised against small-pox because I felt that at any time Australia could be subjected to an outbreak of that disease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this regard I have in mind the case of a  Mr Richardson  who has 6 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He advised me that the construction work which is being carried on at present in relation to a new dam on Thursday Island has necessitated the removal of  2  families - one with  6  <span class="highlight">children</span> - and may involve up to  5  or  6  families in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is the only way in which they will be able to protect the deposits for themselves and their <span class="highlight">children</span> and, if the mining continues over a number of years, for their <span class="highlight">children</span>’s <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A man on that wage with 4 or 5 <span class="highlight">children</span> still has to insure with the fund to get benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the man with the smaller income, the man who is in need but who does not qualify under the minimum wage standards that we will be discussing later during the course of this debate, this provision can mean a great deal - and not only to him but also to his <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the Australian community is perfectly willing to make a small contribution that will give all people, including their <span class="highlight">children</span>, protection against sickness and ensure the security and welfare of families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Government make a statement condemning wholesale massacres of innocent men, women and <span class="highlight">children</span> in Vietnam by the Americans, as alleged in newspaper reports over the last six months; if so, when. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>of the principal Act comes under division 5a which refers to handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> in approved handicapped persons homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> are under a great disadvantage compared with the normal child in the Australian community and we believe that the handicapped child should not be further deprived of benefit by having the amount of $1.50 included in an Act of this nature when the general provision for all other sections of the community is $2. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that it is an important matter which is in the interests of the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> and 1 have therefore moved the amendment on behalf of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is so much that money cannot provide for the handicapped child - that is in terms of a small benefit or subsidy on behalf of the child - and [ would hope that the Commonwealth and the States would be able to develop schemes to assist physically handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> which would be much more generous than the payment of$1. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This benefit has provided very valuable assistance to the parents of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> and is considered to be adequate in the present circumstances and having regard to the Commonwealth’s overall commitments in the field of health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The section now under notice refers to the handicapped child who is in a handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s home where the medical treatment required is not so intensive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our view assistance to the full amount of contributions for standard hospital and medical coverage should be provided by the Commonwealth Government to the head of a family with two dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> where the family income, exclusive of child endowment, for a defined period, does not exceed the minimum wage payable under Commonwealth awards or the State in which they reside (with appropriate adjustment for assets). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This amount should be reduced by $4 where there is only one child and by a further $4 where there are no <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly where there are more than two dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> in the family the amount should be increased by $4 for each additional child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, as we read it the Nimmo Committee recommended that a person in this category with more than 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> should be allowed for assessment purposes an additional $4 per week per child and would obtain health insurance coverage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under such a proposal a person earning $58.50 with 6 dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> would be entitled to receive some protection, but under the Government’s proposals once a person’s income exceeds $48.50 he has to find the wherewithal for insurance purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed there could be the anomalous situation of a man earning 558.50 a week with a wife and 6 dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> to support not coming within the scope of protection whereas under the Government’s present proposal a man earning $42.50 a week with only himself and his wife to maintain would receive coverage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a man in such an income bracket has as dependants a wife and 6 <span class="highlight">children</span> he still would have to pay $1 a week for medical and hospital insurance, and at the same time he would be obliged to bridge the gap between the common fee specified and the refund received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned earlier, under the present proposals we may have the anomalous situation that a man who has a wife and 6 <span class="highlight">children</span> dependent upon him and earns $58 a week is excluded from these categories, whereas a man who earns $42 a week and has only 1 person dependent upon him is roped in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many honourable senators, without any doubt, had a general practitioner deliver their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators examine what happened with their families they will find that in most cases general practitioners delivered their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are the people of this country to be treated like <span class="highlight">children</span> by being told that the Government does not want to speak about Budget matters before the Budget? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We shall give capital assistance on a 2 for 1 basis to approved institutions which give training for the various kinds of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> - the blind, the deaf, the spastic, the crippled and the mentally retarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government of course provides a subsidy of $1.50 per day in respect of the accommodation away from home of certain handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as this occurs, it will allow them to devote greater funds towards assisting handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> in other ways, lt will, of course, still be possible for a qualified body which receives a capital or maintenance subsidy from the Stats, to receive the Commonwealth subsidy in addition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the measures proposed in the Bill  are designed specifically to assist  in  providing facilities for the training of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>, from pre-school onwards, it is not only the <span class="highlight">children</span> who will benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is also on these parents that much of the responsibility rests to establish many of the special schools, training centres and hostels that these <span class="highlight">children</span> need to enable them to live as normal a life as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No Government could hope to duplicate the type of service that is provided by parents and those who dedicate themselves to supplying the needs of these <span class="highlight">children</span> because no Government service could supply the love and sympathy and understanding that is every bit as necessary as the classrooms, the play areas and the special equipment that these <span class="highlight">children</span> require. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless the measures proposed in the Bill will materially help some handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> to take their place in the work-force and to join fully in the life of the community; it will help others to enter sheltered employment or al least to become more a part of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy President,  this Bill is a practical measure, lt takes the Commonwealth into a new area of welfare work but it will enable voluntary and religious organisations to improve and expand a service which they have been providing for many years, lt provides Ibr a $2 Federal subsidy for every $1 subscribed from private or local government funds for capital expert- diture on training centres, training equipment and hostels for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘<span class="highlight">Children</span>’ includes both handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> under 21 years of age and those who, although over 21 years of age, have received continuous training since childhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure honourable senators that, in the administration of the Act, the Department of Social Services will employ the greatest flexibility, with the aim of providing effective help as soon as possible, while seeing that our resources are genuinely directed to the real needs of these <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Voluntary organisations and religious bodies want to provide a better service for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> and the Commonwealth wants to help them achieve that worthy objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having regard to my experience of directorships and so on, I think that to suggest that the matter must be handled in this way in order to provide for elasticity and rapidity of change is to treat us as <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister seen reports that the first Australian science course for primary schools will be introduced in Victoria next year to give primary  school  <span class="highlight">children</span> a grounding in several branches of science including physics, chemistry and biology? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could  this consideration be undertaken in the light of overseas experience which shows that <span class="highlight">children</span> in their formative years are able to absorb knowledge al a much younger age than was thought to be the case hitherto? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put my answer in that form because I would not pretend to answer a question that involves a judgment on curricula or the appropriateness of any instruction for <span class="highlight">children</span> of any particular age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thu Bill also extends this right to pre-1959 officers serving on 4th June 1969 who have since retired on pension or, if they have died, to their widows or orphan <span class="highlight">children</span> to whom pensions are being paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 would like to quote from an article which appeared in the ‘Australian’ of 9th September 1969 which explained the dangers of rubella and the effects it has on new born <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Rubella - commonly and wrongfully called German measles - is a mild infection in adults but is considered the greatest single cause of deformity in new born <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hundreds of births of deformed <span class="highlight">children</span> each year are attributed to rubella infection in these women during early pregnancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Later,  Dr Swan  of Adelaide and  Dr Gregg  found that a high proportion of these <span class="highlight">children</span>, as they became older, was deaf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was noted also at that time that many of the <span class="highlight">children</span> had other deformities as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The information gathered from those conversations would suggest that, in the minds of those soldiers, Australian servicemen in Vietnam had been engaged in the shooting of civilians including women and <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am raising this matter today because everything that is done under the Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span> (Assistance) Bill occurs on the say-so of the Secretary of the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The school desks which were suitable for their fathers, mothers, grandfathers and grandmothers are no longer big enough for the young Japanese <span class="highlight">children</span> of today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-60-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore we require this second line of defence to give security to our economy, to our standard of living and to our women and <span class="highlight">children</span> so that the good life that we enjoy may continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The figures I have just given are by way of illustration and are based on afamilyof husband and wife and would vary if the family included one or more dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>, or conisisted of  1  parent and a child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In response to a request by one of the bodies which is concerned with handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>, I would ask the Minister whether she will give the assurance expressly here in the Committee of the Senate that the provisions of the Bill extend to cover autistic <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand perfectly the fear that has been in the minds of some people who are concerned with autistic <span class="highlight">children</span> because I have worked with them myself and they have approached me also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure him thai autistic <span class="highlight">children</span> will be included among handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to draw the Minister’s attention to the definition of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> in clause 4 and to put forward a submission put to me in the hope that in due course it will receive attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been put to me that the institutions, the homes and the people who look after these <span class="highlight">children</span> receive many of them at a very early age, and that they continue on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps at some later stage when further consideration is given to this measure, consideration could be given not only to extendingthe definition to cover <span class="highlight">children</span> who have attained the age of 21 years as in the terms of the Bill but also to including a provision thatthe DirectorGeneral shall recognise as handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> persons who, by reason of their handicap, require special training or special facilities to be made available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN (Queensland - Minister for Housing) 3.26] - I would like to inform the Senate that where an organisation’s primary purpose is to provide training for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> or to provide residential accommodation for such <span class="highlight">children</span>, then the fact that organisations were, as an incidental to that primary purpose, providing training or accommodation for a few adults, who do not come within the definition of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>, would not affect their eligibility for assistance under the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill provides for a $2 subsidy for every $1 subscribed from private or local government funds for capital expenditure on training institutions for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tremendous problem is the recurring expenditure, how to pay the specialised staff - the physiotherapist, the speech therapist, the occupational therapist, the psychologist and the nursing staff at these homes and the staff who visit families who have <span class="highlight">children</span> in need of care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are also the social welfare workers who assist parents in the education of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister estimates that there are some 50,000 handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is only an estimate, for the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  in replying to a question in the House of Representatives in May of this year advised that the number of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia is not known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the latest figures of the World Health Organisation, Australia has an estimated 300,000 mentally retarded <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">children</span> are divided into 3 categories - mildly, modestly and severely retarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>aspects associated wilh the provision of assistance to handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>”. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know it affects every person, who could rightly think ‘There but for the grace of God goes one of our <span class="highlight">children</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This committee of inquiry which we request should report upon every incidence, status and condition of handicapped persons, including <span class="highlight">children</span> disadvantaged because of physical or mental disability, chronic illness, or injury; and upon the adequacy of existing Commonwealth and State social welfare legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They did nol want the dynamic provided by the Subnormal <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Welfare Association replaced with the impersonality of ihe State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They wanted merely: An officer of the Commonwealth Education Department directed to investigate the best overseas methods of conveying some form of instruction to subnormal <span class="highlight">children</span>; research through the Health Department into the causes of subnormal births; and a grant of 1,000 a year to enable the association to function Federally and a Commonwealth subsidy for capital expenditure on a pound-for-pound basis to erect centres and schools for the <span class="highlight">children</span> to the limit of 10,000 in any one year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if favourable, it could possibly, by strengthening the association’s capacity to care for subnormal <span class="highlight">children</span>, bring relief from fear and worry to a handful of families scattered throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 initiated the discussion of a matter of urgent public importance, namely, the need for a national inquiry into the problems of the mentally retarded <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I add that the present Leader of the Government in the Senate,  Senator Anderson,  then a New South Wales State member, himself moved an adjournment motion in the New South Wales Parliament back in 1952, and as a result teachers were ultimately provided for retarded <span class="highlight">children</span> in schools within his area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, in 1964 a motion was moved by myself for adjournment of the Senate to discuss the need for a national inquiry into the problem of mentally retarded <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me here express concern for parents who have known the tragedy of a handicapped child and I believe that proper scientific treatment, which should be available, may be able to bring some benefits to these people I mentioned also that  Senator Anderson,  when a member of the New South Wales Parliament back in 1952, moved a motion for adjournment of the Legislative Assembly to debate these problems, and that by so doing he was largely responsible for the provision of teachers for retarded <span class="highlight">children</span> in New South Wales, and particularly in the area that he represented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>importance, namely, ‘the need for a national inquiry into the problems of mentally retarded <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia’, and in the debate on that motion senators on both sides of the house expressed their strong opinions on these issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Autistic <span class="highlight">children</span> pose a grave problem today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is estimated that there are 1,500 autistic <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might add that there arc twice as many autistic <span class="highlight">children</span> as blind <span class="highlight">children</span>, and more autistic <span class="highlight">children</span> than deaf <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we can get these <span class="highlight">children</span> early enough, there is hope that something can possibly be done for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One need only reflect back to one’s early childhood to remember the nasty references we may have made to some <span class="highlight">children</span> who came along to school who were referred to as dummies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today there is a greater acceptance of these <span class="highlight">children</span>, and indeed this measure is again pushing ahead Federal assistance for the first time in attempting to build institutions where they can be housed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note that the Director General, where he is satisfied that training is provided or proposed to be provided at any premise for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> who, by reason of their handicap, are in need of training for which special facilities are required and that training so provided or proposed to be provided will meet that need, may for the purposes of this Act assist with the training so provided or proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had some interest over a number of years in this matter as I have been fortunate to have been since 1954 part of the management of the largest school for deaf <span class="highlight">children</span> in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Victorian School for Deaf <span class="highlight">Children</span> was some years ago known as the Victorian Deaf and Dumb Society, and the changed name is again an indication that society has changed its views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Victorian School for Deaf <span class="highlight">Children</span> carries out the ideas which are proposed to be assisted by this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the housing of <span class="highlight">children</span> these days I am certain that unless there is a love content present among people who are likely to run the organisation the problems that arise for these <span class="highlight">children</span> in their later life are made even greater by the fact that, because of their affliction, they must be away from their families, lt brings one to realise that the assistance that may flow in future years from this particular measure is not only assistance for the <span class="highlight">children</span> but, indeed, for a child being born with some affliction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, the word does not apply, for instance, if the child is injured in a motor accident, but if the child is born with some affliction - and this is the point that I wish to mention to the Senate - the assistance flows not only to the parents of the child but to the other <span class="highlight">children</span> who may be within the family or, indeed, to the close relatives and people of the particular family from which the handicapped child comes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, they have not given sufficient attention to supplying the facilities necessary for those <span class="highlight">children</span> who may require special schools for the treatment of their illness, whether they be institutions for deaf <span class="highlight">children</span>, blind <span class="highlight">children</span>, spastic <span class="highlight">children</span> or those who have an autistic problem, as was mentioned by  Senator Fitzgerald,  and certainly those who have multiple sclerosis, who we know need very special care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 wonder whether we are taking sufficient action in relation to the road toll, which undoubtedly today is causing injuries to <span class="highlight">children</span> who will want the facilities we are talking about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw the cases overseas involving the birth of deformed <span class="highlight">children</span> because the mothers were taking thalidomide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result was that handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> were born. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the potents that we have in the community today, and some of the chemicals which are being applied on rural lands and which are flowing into the water that we are likely  to  drink may result in the birth of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am delighted  to  support the measure which provides assistance for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we do not intend to oppose the Bill, we express the opinion that a select committee should be established to inquire  into  all aspects associated with the provision of assistance to handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt would appear that the Bill is not wide enough to cover the many questions that  Senator Webster  raised, such as the prevention, if there is any prevention, of the birth of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>, lt is a fact of life that we are seeing the birth of increasing numbers of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that he is to be congratulated on his understanding of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> over a period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Webster  referred to the necessity to provide these <span class="highlight">children</span> with love and affection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we apply it to <span class="highlight">children</span>  1  think we really mean ‘sympathy’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it could do untold harm to try to raise these handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>, who are deserving of sympathy, by treating them differently from other <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the State of South Australia, from which I come, there are government institutions for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> and many of them have specially trained teachers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The weakness in the Bill is that it does not make provision for these government institutions which have a responsibility to educate and look after <span class="highlight">children</span>, whether they are disabled <span class="highlight">children</span> or otherwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it would be a great pity if we reached the stage where there was a tendency for governments to get rid of their responsibility for educating and looking after these <span class="highlight">children</span>, to hand it over to voluntary organisations, through the governments’ financial inability to make provision for these <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt should be the responsibility of society to look after disabled <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is insufficient, to my mind, for the purpose of honouring our responsibility to disabled <span class="highlight">children</span>, lt places a disadvantage on disabled <span class="highlight">children</span> in a depressed area which cannot provide the necessary accommodation, or as good accommodation or schooling, as can a more affluent area in our cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had an early interest in these <span class="highlight">children</span> because very many years ago it was one of my voluntary efforts 1 day a week to take the rubella <span class="highlight">children</span> to a pre-oral kindergarten run by the State for the purpose of trying to rehabilitate these <span class="highlight">children</span> into society, so that they could perform useful functions in life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who are concerned - they form an association comprising mostly people with disabled <span class="highlight">children</span> - have protested against this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are high in praise of the government organisations that are looking after disabled <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No Government could hope to duplicate the type of service that is provided by parents and those who dedicate themselves to supplying the needs of these <span class="highlight">children</span> because no Government service could supply the love and sympathy and understanding that is every bil as necessary as the classrooms, the play areas and the special equipment that these <span class="highlight">children</span> require. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I now wish to refer to the people who are most concerned with and are most active in retarded <span class="highlight">children</span>’s activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I received a letter from a  Mrs I.  D. Nies, the Secretary of the Mentally Retarded <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Association, of Maud Street, Unley, South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mrs Nies,  incidentally, is Secretary-Treasurer of the Mentally Retarded <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Society of South Australia Incorporated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That letter, referring to the proposed Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span> (Assistance) Act 1970 states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania the Education Departments have accepted the responsibility to provide free education for all <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This assistance is better than nothing at all but falls far short of the standard set by the first named States which provide properly established schools staffed by departmentally trained teachers for all <span class="highlight">children</span>, handicapped or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All <span class="highlight">children</span>, without any exception whatsoever, shall be entitled to these rights without distinction or discrimination on account of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or social origin, property, birth or other status, whether of himself or of his family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, a group of parents who have disabled <span class="highlight">children</span> and who arc interested in the welfare of their <span class="highlight">children</span> generally collect for such a cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those purposes do not include the provision of aged persons homes or assistance for disabled <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that il may be even further extended to permit the expenditure of money for the purpose of assisting handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do nol want to get to the stage in South Australia at which provisions for aid for these <span class="highlight">children</span> in affluent suburbs will be different from those in working class suburbs in which charitable moneys for these purposes are not very readily available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make an earnest appeal to all in the Senate, whether Government or Opposition - for this is not a party matter - to support a thorough inquiry into this question to see whether there is a solution, whether we know all the problems and whether we can contribute anything to preventing an increase in the number of disabled <span class="highlight">children</span> in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>particularly in relation lo those <span class="highlight">children</span> whose affliction when they were born seemed to be of a mental character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he asks me to define il, I may have difficulty, but it is the love of parents who I know who have had spastic and even mongol <span class="highlight">children</span>, and their dedication and refusal to abandon those <span class="highlight">children</span> to institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen similar <span class="highlight">children</span> today who have been able to go to special schools where they have been able to develop other parts of the brain to take over the portion of the brain that has been damaged and, by the time they are 14 or 15 years old, they have grown into what we regard as quite normal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such <span class="highlight">children</span> were all regarded as backward or silly and, because nobody tried, there were no successes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The caring for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> requires a dedication which many of us as normal human beings, unless we have a personal interest in this subject, are incapable of understanding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But once one becomes personally involved in the caring for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> it is a different matter altogether. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many a person who is allegedly born normal in the future will owe a great deal to those handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> we are assisting at present who some people say were not born normal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think wc all appreciate what this measure will mean to handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have all seen the tragedy of <span class="highlight">children</span> who are born nol so well equipped as other <span class="highlight">children</span> not being able to take their place in the family circle and in the community at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These young <span class="highlight">children</span> have had to be trained so that the) can take a part in the community and can live a happier and fuller life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We shall give capital assistance on a  2  for I basis lo approved institutions which give training for the various kinds of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think it is a very good thing that a Bill of this nature should come before the Senate because not only will it result in the provision of the assistance outlined in the Bill but it also gives us an opportunity to express our appreciation to the dedicated people who have served in this field and given the love, affection and care which is so necessary in assisting handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One or two points were raised by honourable senators - 1 think 1 would be right if I said that they were raised mainly by  Senator Cavanagh,  although  Senator Fitzgerald  did touch upon them - in connection wilh the voluntary organisations and the State schools and organisations which are assisting handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been supplied wilh information which indicated that in all States there are voluntary organisations which assume some responsibility for the training and accommodation of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>, including those below school agc and others of school agc who are classified as non-educable by the Slate authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill will reduce the need for the States to provide capital subventions to voluntary bodies to allow them to devote more funds towards assisting handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> in other ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The benefits that will stem from this measure are virtually incalculable and cannot fail to give new heart to all groups who have striven for so long to give handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> a chance to live as well as they can. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government has already set up an interdepartmental committee comprising officers of the Departments of Social Services, Health, and Education and Science to survey the extent of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> and the facilities available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important that honourable senators should be aware of the existence of that committee which is carrying out  a  survey of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> and the facilities available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even now, that $30,000 does not meet the serious cases and in an ordinary common law action in the courts it would be common for a young working /nan who is injured - and his widow and <span class="highlight">children</span> if he is killed - to recover more than $30,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendments envisaged by this Bill include an increase in the weekly rate of compensation for a seaman from $28.15 to $31.80 and increases in weekly rates from $6.80 to $7.70 for a seaman’s wife and from $2.50 to $2.80 for each of a seaman’s <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700612_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator referred to a report concerning a man who recently came here with his brother’s wife and two <span class="highlight">children</span> as British assisted migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> were put forward as the man’s own <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The man and woman and her two <span class="highlight">children</span> travelled to Australia with the type of document of identity normally used by assisted migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The following actions have been taken: - Additional positions  of  hygiene supervisor, supervisor family  services,  nursing sisters, a’nd assistant kitchen supervisor have been added to the settlement staff; - The Department of Health has provided additional Health Inspectors to service the settlements and mission stations;  - a  new kitchen/dining room unit, a home management centre and an infant welfare centre have been built; - 65 houses with an appropriate number of laundry, toilet and ablution blocks have been erected for Aboriginal families; - The hospital has been renovated and improved; - A substantially improved water supply has been installed; - A water-borne sewerage scheme for the settlement is scheduled for early construction and funds have been set aside for this purpose; - Health education is being stressed in the school and adult education programme; sisters of the Health Department are assisting with infant welfare and health education programmes; - A research project into the incidence of deaths amongst <span class="highlight">children</span> at Yuendumu is being undertaken by the Australian National University and the Adelaide University in conjunction with the Welfare Branch of the Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A commodity such as dairy produce is essential, particularly for <span class="highlight">children</span>, and the family man will be asked to pay more not only in prices but also in taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This would provide the widow with $100 per week with which to support herself and her <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, a widow in such circumstances is expected to try to educate her <span class="highlight">children</span> on $12,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely also the problems of rearing <span class="highlight">children</span> must be different in respect of each man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding all the mental strain and anguish caused by the death of her husband she is faced at the end of 2 years with the difficulty of sustaining herself and perhaps her <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mrs Biggs,  however, wished to remain in Australia in the interests of her <span class="highlight">children</span>’s future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the present case the 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> were taken away from their father in Britain without his consent or knowledge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has naturally most strongly protested and is demanding the return of his <span class="highlight">children</span> to him in Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has not the action taken been influenced largely by other considerations, such as the father’s request in relation to the <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the rights or wrongs in this complicated situation, surely if the interests of the <span class="highlight">children</span> are to be taken into account the paramount consideration should be the welfare of those <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would this not be a belter course than summarily to order the deportation of the <span class="highlight">children</span>, one not knowing really whether in the long run this is in the interests of the <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Press reports that  Mrs Taylor  is said to have been living apart from her husband for 12 months and also that her husband will be initiating legal proceedings in regard to the <span class="highlight">children</span>, would it not be more appropriate to arrange for an adjustment of the fares in respect of these people and then to allow the legal proceedings to be taken by the husband overseas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely, from what she has already said the action of the Department of Immigration is largely influenced by considerations as to what has happened between the husband and the wife and the position of the <span class="highlight">children</span>, and not merely by the misrepresentation and entry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I ask this question: As the Government has been so solicitous for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of  Mrs Biggs  - and I am grateful that it has been because 1 think the <span class="highlight">children</span> ought to be kept with their mother - why differentiate and say that the <span class="highlight">children</span> in the Taylor case ought to be kept with their father and that therefore the mother has to go through a life that neither the Minister nor I can envisage? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not clear from what the Minister has said that a decision is being made on moral grounds, or on the ground of what is the proper thing to be done for the <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that not the kind of decision which ought to be made by the courts which traditionally, here and in England, have always acted as the guardians of <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would this not be better than the Commonwealth arrogating to itself the decision as to what is the proper order which ought to be made in respect of the <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not time the Department of Immigration refrained from using discretionary powers to make decisions of this nature that ought to be made by the courts nf the land which are the guardians of the <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that  Mrs Taylor  and her <span class="highlight">children</span> are being deported because of a legal defect in regard to her coming to Australia and bearing in mind that the father desires the <span class="highlight">children</span>, does the Minister know whether any investigations have been made as to  Mrs Taylor  herself? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Exactly 2 years ago I raised the question of trying to prevent accidents to young <span class="highlight">children</span> under the age of 5 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many <span class="highlight">children</span> are brought to the public hospitals of Australia suffering from poisoning as a result of their obtaining tablets from containers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those 2 years nearly 3,000 babies and <span class="highlight">children</span> under the age of 5 years have been admitted to our public hospitals in Australia suffering from poisoning as a result of ingesting medical tablets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Approximately 3,000 <span class="highlight">children</span> have been admitted to hospital because of poisoning as a result of the ingestion of medical tablets and capsules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some brilliant <span class="highlight">children</span> might be able to do so, but at least the bulk of them would not be able to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course it is the fault of the parents for not putting their drugs away, but in every household these things happen and when elderly people are careless about their tablets <span class="highlight">children</span> will get at them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But it does not matter how the <span class="highlight">children</span> manage to get the tablets; the point is that this was a preventable disease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The National Health and Medical Research Council, upon whom this matter was thrust, stated straight out that it recognised the need for increased education in the prevention of accidental poisoning and it commended the use of tablet containers which would not readily be opened by young <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There should be a vote of no confidence in the Minister for Health over his handling of the affairs of his Department, lt is outrageous that for 2 years the Minister did nothing about the problem of <span class="highlight">children</span> being poisoned with drugs and medicines to which they should not have had access, lt was only on 5th August 1970 that the Minister sent a memorandum to pharmacists about this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is a right which the school <span class="highlight">children</span>, such as those who are in the public galleries at the present time, are taught in their school books was one of the great rights that have come down not only from the British heritage but also from ancient Greece and other places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In July 1964, after the circumstances  of  Barry McKenzie’s departure had come to notice, passport procedures were amended to require the production  of  a full birth certificate, which names the parents  of  the child, when persons seek to have the names  of  <span class="highlight">children</span> included in their passports at the time of issue or added subsequently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am the first to recognise that that would not be the taxable income, so we need to deduct such things as the allowances for <span class="highlight">children</span> and for education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>SO a week has a wife and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> and receives deductions for dependants, rates and taxes and the other things that are reasonably accepted as deductible, his deductions could quite easily total $500 or $600. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Murphy  said: _ No attempt is made in the Budget to provide the finance necessary to give our <span class="highlight">children</span> the opportunity for education to which they are entitled as a basic human right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us consider the case of a family man who has a wife and 4 <span class="highlight">children</span> and receives $60 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Undoubtedly the education of our citizens, particularly the education of our young citizens and <span class="highlight">children</span> will be one of the great contributing factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should add, of course, that where a pensioner has dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> the income limits I have quoted above are still further increased as is the property limit for ‘single’ pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The increase of 50 cents per week will apply to all widow pensioners, so that a B Class widow - that is a widow aged 50 to 60 and without dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> - will now receive $13.75 per week plus, where applicable, Supplementary Assistance of $2 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a guardian allowance for pensioners with <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1965 the Government introduced the fantastic guardian’s allowance for pensioners with <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The backlash of all this is that the taxpayer can claim allowances for <span class="highlight">children</span> attending school - for uniforms, costs of transport and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said publicly previously, and I say again, that the Government is driving some of these women to a desperate position where rather than see their <span class="highlight">children</span> starve they will sell their bodies for a night a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a minority of women who will do this before they will see their <span class="highlight">children</span> starve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably <span class="highlight">children</span> also are involved in these circumstances but the Government says that these wives need only about half the amount given to husbands in order to keep body and soul together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compare the situation of those people with that of a man with 3 or 4 <span class="highlight">children</span> whom he had educated and who, because he has contributed to a superannuation scheme at. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He receives his wage, with which in theory he is expected to keep a wife and 2 or more <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, the original concept was a wife and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I recall it,  Senator Keeffe  relied upon basically the same figures in speaking of the costs faced by mothers in clothing <span class="highlight">children</span> for school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is good enough for my <span class="highlight">children</span> and no doubt for great numbers of school <span class="highlight">children</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That old system very substantially reduces the costs involved in clothing school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures cited by  Senator Keeffe  are quite unreal because they are based on the supposition that every parent of school <span class="highlight">children</span> buys new clothing for each child and that no school child  s  ever accepts hand-me-down clothing from a brother or cousin to be worn for as long as it fits and then passed on to somebody else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the basic wage to which  Senator Rae  referred was based on the needs of a family unit of a man and his wife and their 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This meant that those couples who had more than 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> had to curtail some of their expenditure and live somewhat cheaper than a man who had only his wife and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> to support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the family unit with less than 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>, including the single man, received a higher income and did somewhat better out of the basic wage which was determined from time to time according to cost of Irving figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chifley Government introduced the child endowment system in order to give some justice to those couples who had more than 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The family on a low income - even  a  family whose breadwinner has had constant work, on a tradesman’s wage with a tow margin- employs its income perhaps in the rearing of 3 or 4 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the rearing of <span class="highlight">children</span> is expensive, this leaves the family nothing to save. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps they live in an impoverished furnished home until such time as the <span class="highlight">children</span> grow up and go out to work to supplement the income of the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the <span class="highlight">children</span> get married, if the father is still young enough to work, he may have some opportunity to save a few bob. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But possibly the parents will spend money more lavishly on presents for the grandchildren than they were capable of spending on their own <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would anyone condemn them for this expenditure on the grandchildren? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a son or daughter has had an unfortunate marriage and finds it hard to get along - and this is happening in all of these working class homes with 3 or 4 <span class="highlight">children</span> - the parents contribute to help them along. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While most adults would be aware that these matches and the gimmicks used are faked, does the Minister agree that such exhibitionism should not be shown at 12.30 p.m. on Sundays when large numbers of <span class="highlight">children</span> would no doubt be viewing this programme? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I read  Senator Keeffe’s  statement and I gave him the benefit of this interpretation: that he said there would be widows who, because of their economic consequences, would be forced into the situation where they may have to resort to immoral practices in order to sustain the <span class="highlight">children</span> who are their responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Speaking of widows, 11 remind the Senate that it was this Government which introduced the mother’s allowance and the additional payment for the second and subsequent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that these payments have been of assistance to widows who are caring for their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the repatriation field there ought to be a proper compensation basis for people who are disabled because of their war service and particularly for the widows and orphaned <span class="highlight">children</span> of ex-servicemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government says: ‘All we are prepared to do is, on each occasion on which the general economy and the financial position of the country are considered, to see what we can do in respect of the pensions for ex-servicemen disabled people, their widows and their orphaned <span class="highlight">children</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly - and equally importantly - there are the widows and the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the deceased ex-servicemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister institute an inquiry into the statement of the learned judge that the accused had ‘succumbed quickly to the urge to inflict violence, but this was something he had been taught’, and the further statement to the accused ‘that the way you killed your victim with your bare hands was something that the Army encouraged you to learn’, if so, and if an inquiry finds the Army was in any degree to blame, will appropriate compensation be paid to the orphaned <span class="highlight">children</span> of the dead woman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the fact that, during 1969, at least 1,500 <span class="highlight">children</span> under the age of five were taken to hospital with poisoning as the result of the ingestion of medical tablets and capsules, why are the Minister and the Department of Health so dilatory in taking any action which would have helped prevent these accidents, as this problem as first brought to their notice in September 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700930_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that Government policy prevents assisted passages being granted to coloured persons; if so, does this same policy apply to a person of European blood and colour, who is a British subject and has an Indian wife and 3 <span class="highlight">children</span> who are all British subjects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a disgraceful situation when, because he chose somebody he desired to spend the rest of his life with and because he chose to have a family and bring young <span class="highlight">children</span> into this community, the Government says ‘No’ because the colour of his wife’s skin is different, and because the colour of his <span class="highlight">children</span>’s skin will be different, from the colour of his own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I inform the honourable senator that entry of the wife or <span class="highlight">children</span> of a European migrant is not denied because they are not fully European, but an assisted passage is not normally granted to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In addition, if both the husband and wife die and there are <span class="highlight">children</span> under the age of 16 years left the pension is drastically reduced and there is not sufficient to maintain the <span class="highlight">children</span> or keep them at school until such time as they can receive a reasonable education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The disruption of family life, including <span class="highlight">children</span>’s schooling, which these practices cause is a prime element, I believe, in the resignation of Service personnel and failure to re-engage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To realise the tremendous nervous strain being placed on people who live in areas adjacent to the airport - I refer particularly to young <span class="highlight">children</span> - one has only to sit in homes in suburbs like Kyeemagh, Bexley, Rockdale, Marrickville, Randwick and other nearby suburbs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With this went the power to declare under the act any of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of assisted Aborigines if they hadnot attained or not apparently attained 17 years of age (S.19). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the so-called settlement areas that are allocated to Aboriginals outside most Queensland country towns, particularly in the western areas, we find fairly large numbers of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A percentage of the <span class="highlight">children</span>, probably as high as 60 per cent, show signs of either malnutrition or all the other kiddies’ disease that catch up with youngsters who are forced to live in ill-ventilated homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First of all, we could improve the health of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Secondly, having provided Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> with some sort of an education, the next big problem is to provide job opportunities for them, because they are not being provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  think that throughout Australia, only 5 or 6 Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> are undergoing university education, and this is a disgrace to this country and to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The availability of education facilities is vital because until we get the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> and train and educate them they will continue to behave as they have done in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that this benefit, too, will be of tremendous assistance to the people in the area and to the young <span class="highlight">children</span> who are the ones who, we believe, are so important to help their people face the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> who may be attending school at some time in the future are reluctant to leave their home country, even though economically it may be much poorer than Australia because they are aware of the hardships they will have to endure if they are to give their <span class="highlight">children</span> the sort of education which is available to them in their homeland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government introduced in 1956 the payment of an additional pension for <span class="highlight">children</span> after the first and subsequently provision was made for extending the payment in respect of student <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-95-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This takes on a new importance when it is recognised that <span class="highlight">children</span>, by virtue of their going to school or having an association with Australian-born <span class="highlight">children</span>, have a distinct advantage in acquiring a knowledge of the English language rather more rapidly than their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For some years the Commonwealth has been concerned about the difficulties encountered by migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> and adult migrants in learning the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The division was to undertake an investigation into the effectiveness of the existing provisions for teaching English to migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> and adult migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> it was pointed out that many of them, in both government and independent schools, were handicapped by some difficulty with the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of the 50,000 migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> surveyed, 32 per cent had this kind of problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greatest area of problem and the most frequently occurring type of difficulty involving 76 per cent of the migrant school <span class="highlight">children</span> involved was in the comprehension of English and difficulty in reading and speaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that the Commonwealth had undertaken the responsibility for financing the expansion of existing facilities for the instruction of adult migrants; the provision of intensive full-time English language courses for those who must know English in order to follow occupations; and special classes in existing schools for migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> of all ages to ensure that they achieved the education to which their intelligence and natural skills entitled them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent years there has been increasing concern over the extent to which migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> are handicapped by English language difficulty - particularly in school subjects in which verbal communication between pupil and teacher plays a predominant part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>An important consideration is whether migrant <span class="highlight">children</span>, to whom this Bill particularly refers, face special problems because of what I have seen described as a culture conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As immigrants are confronted with the impact of social and economic upheaval they and their <span class="highlight">children</span> must make a rapid and complete adjustment to a new society, to new attitudes, to new values and to new resources, all of which are different to what they have previously experienced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is not so important with <span class="highlight">children</span> because they pick up languages much more quickly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Bill has been forced upon the Commonwealth because of the growing deficiencies in State educational systems which have dealt with the problem of integrating new settlers into our community and with the problem of educating <span class="highlight">children</span> who have a deficiency in the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the great majority of cases that deficiency is overcome very rapidly when the young <span class="highlight">children</span> concerned attend school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps the States were using funds that were meant for education in general to provide crash courses in English to enable people from other countries - particularly <span class="highlight">children</span> - to cope more readily with the education system in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As has been stated already in this House and by the Minister in another place, in February 1960 a special committee of the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council submitted a report on the progress and assimilation of migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This involved a study of both pre-school <span class="highlight">children</span> and <span class="highlight">children</span> in primary and secondary schools, a survey of schools in which migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> .were enrolled and consultation with the teachers who were dealing with these <span class="highlight">children</span> very closely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This led to the report which has been referred to previously on the situation of migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> in schools in New South Wales and which has provided such an important basis for the new initiatives in child migrant education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A line was drawn arbitrarily at a level equal to $33 a week for a family of a man and his wife and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> - this was in 1969 - and anything below that line constituted poverty and anything less than 20 per cent above it constituted marginal poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However worth while it may be to bring new citizens, including <span class="highlight">children</span>, from other countries do we give them priority in national concern over the creation of a growing national population from our own physical resources? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the 8.5 per cent is applied to the 333,000 families it will be seen that probably 30,000 Australian families of 3 or more <span class="highlight">children</span> are living in poverty or are below the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were as follows: For the first child,  Si  a week - at the moment it is 50c; for the second child, $1.50 a week, whereas at the moment it is $1; for the third child $3.50 a week, whereas at the present time it is  Si  -SO; for the fourth and subsequent <span class="highlight">children</span> $4.50 per week for each child, whereas for the fourth child the present rate is $1.75, increasing to $3.25 a week for the tenth child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second change I mention occurred in 1964 when the rate for the third child and subsequent <span class="highlight">children</span> in a family was increased by 50c to $1.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where there are 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> in the family the amount received is a mere $1.50 a week, but when there are 8 <span class="highlight">children</span> in the family the amount received is $14.25 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I  remind honourable senators that income tax deductions for <span class="highlight">children</span> have been substantially increased since 1949-50 Of course, they bear no relationship to the position which prevailed in 1940. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 abhor this type of nonsense, although I have respect for the man who moved the motion as 1 served with him in the period prior to 1955 and 1 know of his support for proposals we have put forward in this chamber in recent weeks, particularly the proposal to investigate the problems of physically and mentally handicapped people, especially <span class="highlight">children</span>, in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe in the importance of healthy, happy <span class="highlight">children</span>, in a home ownership community and in child endowment to go to the mother for the direct assistance of the child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To me it seems appropriate quickly to run through one or two benefits which the Liberal Party and Country Party have introduced such as medical benefits for pensioners, aged persons income tax concessions, pharmaceutical benefits for pensioners, the aged persons home savings grant scheme, television licence concessions for pensioners, additional pension for second and subsequent <span class="highlight">children</span>, home nursing subsidy, supplementary assistance for pensioners, nursing home benefits, mothers allowance for widow pensioners with <span class="highlight">children</span>, subsidies for the provision of accommodation for disabled persons, telephone rental concessions for pensioners, guardians allowance for aged and invalid pensioners with <span class="highlight">children</span>, sheltered employment allowances, hearing aid services, double pension entitlement to widows or widowers for 12 weeks followng the death of a spouse, training scheme for widow pensioners, subsidies for dwellings for aged persons, personal care subsidy for aged pensioners, home care and paramedical services, and meals-on-wheels subsidy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not going into detail because of lack of time but I shall repeat the things this Government has done to assist the family, either indirectly or directly, and also to assist <span class="highlight">children</span> in addition to the child endowment allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has introduced the pharmaceutical benefits which assists the family and the child and introduced income tax concessions in respect of <span class="highlight">children</span> at a total cost to revenue in the year 1967-68 - the latest figure I could obtain - of $266m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat that it is unrealistic to pick on one aspect and say that the Government has been culpably neglectful of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have a much better scheme in Australia where the mother knows that while her <span class="highlight">children</span> are under 16 years of age she will receive a weekly payment for their direct assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the combination of the 2 schemes which we have in Australia - the home savings grant and child endowment - are much more equitable, generous and effective for <span class="highlight">children</span> than if we adopted a scheme like the New Zealand one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is of enormous benefit to families and <span class="highlight">children</span> who know that they can obtain this assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that there are 1,700,000 first <span class="highlight">children</span> in respect of whom parents are receiving child endowment, that there are 1,165,000 second <span class="highlight">children</span>, 569,000 third <span class="highlight">children</span>, 232,000 fourth <span class="highlight">children</span>, 85,000 fifth <span class="highlight">children</span>, 32,000 sixth <span class="highlight">children</span>, 12,000 seventh <span class="highlight">children</span>, 4,000 eighth <span class="highlight">children</span>, 1,500 ninth <span class="highlight">children</span> and 818 tenth or later <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To increase the endowment in respect of each of those <span class="highlight">children</span> would cost $!01m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tt seems to me that we should be praising the Government for what it is doing, for having such a wide range of interests in respect of which improvements are made regularly for the benefit of the family and the <span class="highlight">children</span>, instead of picking out one item and saying that in this respect the Government has been culpably neglectful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The parents of Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> should be made aware of the Government’s lack of interest in this direction and should realise that if, unhappily, the Government is returned at the next general election, whether it is in 1971 or 1972, it will be the fate of child endowment payments to remain at their present stagnated level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a very happy thought for the parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> born in Australia to realise that they are expected to rear their <span class="highlight">children</span> in the most difficult circumstances and that in future they will be given no relief or assistance by way of increased child endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All I am saying is that I am certain that, if the Democratic Labor Party takes the opportunity of supporting the terms of its present motion at a time when its support will mean something to the parents and <span class="highlight">children</span> of this country, a majority of the Senate will be only too pleased to cooperate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one looks at what is happening to State education throughout Australia one can only be forced to the conclusion that the policy of the present Government is for electoral purposes to maintain the Catholic educational system at a subsistence level, a non-Catholic private educational system for the purpose of training some sort of elite, and a State educational system educating - if educating is the correct word - the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the most underprivileged elements of the community to be nothing but hewers of wood and drawers of water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many members of my generation determined to see that our <span class="highlight">children</span> and our <span class="highlight">children</span>’s <span class="highlight">children</span> had better opportunities for education than we had, and that they were not disrupted by such great financial and personal tragedies in this country as were created by the depression of the 1930s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To the shame of Federal and State governments, grants were made to private schools only when it became clear that the State educational system was threatened with complete chaos and collapse because of the entry into that system of <span class="highlight">children</span> who previously had been educated in private schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That situation came about because <span class="highlight">children</span> were attending school until they were older than had been the case in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Federal and State governments of this country saw the justice of spending at least portion of the funds allotted from the public purse for education on <span class="highlight">children</span> attending private schools only when they were driven to it by sheer necessity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seemed that the State system would collapse completely because the <span class="highlight">children</span> educated privately would also need to be catered for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These <span class="highlight">children</span> had been taken off the back of the taxpayers in respect of education expenditure because their parents were paying for their education in addition to their contributions to the public purse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a lie to try to draw a comparison between the 2 education systems and to say that over the whole picture this Bill proves that more money is being spent on the education of <span class="highlight">children</span> in private schools than on those being educated in state schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we were successful in amending the Bill, it would be postponed until such time as the House of Representatives reassembled and consequently there would be a period from now until August when, if a workman were killed, his widow and <span class="highlight">children</span> would be deprived of $1,500 because of our not accepting this unacceptable amending Bill in its entirety now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that families of four or more <span class="highlight">children</span> are penalised by a reduction in child endowment payment when the eldest child becomes eligible for student endowment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it also true that in a family of 8 <span class="highlight">children</span> endowment is reduced from $57 a week to $46 a. week when the eldest child becomes eligible for the $1.25 a week student allowance, thereby losing $65 a year endowment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Child endowment is raised by 50c per week for the third and successive <span class="highlight">children</span>; yet the 21/2 per cent increase in income tax more than takes away that benefit for the average income earner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why else do we have a country with the riches that Australia has - the mineral wealth, the agricultural and pastoral wealth and the income potential - but with the education opportunities for our <span class="highlight">children</span> worse than those for the <span class="highlight">children</span> in other countries such as Japan, with a rate of growth that is falling behind those of other countries and with a social service system such that in the statistics that the United Nations hands out Australia has dropped from being one of the first 3 or 4 in the world at the time this Government came into office to being about twentieth in the world and receding rapidly? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They sit down and take into account what their income is likely to be for the year and what their expenditure will be on the commitments they have to meet - instalments on the house, rent, maintenance of the <span class="highlight">children</span> and themselves, the running cost of a car if they have one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That would be a decision based on a quick assessment, because the average family man - the man I have in mind would have 4, 5 or 6 <span class="highlight">children</span> - on an average rate of pay does not pay tax at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, the Democratic Labor Party is particularly satisfied to note that the increases in child endowment in this Budget are to apply to the third and subsequent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the purpose of fixing a poverty line, the people conducting the survey decided to take as the base the weekly income of a man with a wife and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>, which was below the basic wage plus child endowment, as at 30th June 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-55-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instead of providing an increase in indirect taxation to cover the cost of these things, the Government is saying to the unfortunate wife or widow who has <span class="highlight">children</span> and who has to buy pharmaceuticals: ‘Because you are unfortunate enough to have to go to a chemist shop to buy these things for the protection of your family, or because you arc silly enough to get sick, you will pay for them’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He referred to the case of a family with 8 wholly supported <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, with a family of 2 wholly supported <span class="highlight">children</span> the
          endowment cheque rises by $2 when the eldest school child turns 16. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These people are married and have <span class="highlight">children</span> going to Australian

    <p>Is the Minister aware that many thousands of young <span class="highlight">children</span> are in danger of death through malnutrition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note that the payment for <span class="highlight">children</span> under 16 years in institutions and for each child under the age of 16 years where there are more than  2  <span class="highlight">children</span> in a family will be increased by 50c a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that families of 4 or more <span class="highlight">children</span> are penalised by a reduction in child endowment payment when the eldest child becomes eligible for student endowment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it also true that in a family of 8 <span class="highlight">children</span> endowment is reduced from $57 a week to $46 a week when the eldest child becomes eligible for the $1.25 a week student allowance, thereby losing $65 a’ year endowment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commenting on the Commonwealth Budget last week, the Acting  President Mr F.  A. Woithe,  said that the only new measure introduced for education was an increased taxation deduction which would only benefit those people who sent their <span class="highlight">children</span> to wealthy private schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one who sends his <span class="highlight">children</span> to State schools, or to Catholic, Anglican or Lutheran parochial schools, will benefit,* he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Woithe said that people who sent their <span class="highlight">children</span> to these schools had been unable to claim the previous maximum deduction of 300 dollars, let alone the new maximum of 400 dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Woithe said that a survey conducted last year had shown that every Federal cabinet minister with school age <span class="highlight">children</span> sent them to wealthy private schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to ensure, if it is humanly possible that these people, particularly the <span class="highlight">children</span>, are  helped,  nurtured and guided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed increase of 50c a week will provide some relief for families with more than 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> but 1 believe that an anomaly that does exist in the Social Services Act, and which has been referred to today by  Senator Drury,  has been exposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that he is quite correct when he says that the amount of child endowment received by a family with more than 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> decreases when the eldest of those <span class="highlight">children</span> reaches the age of 16 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of those families, 12,700 have more than 6 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The anomaly which exists is that the child endowment payments received by a family with more than 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> are reduced when the eldest child attains 16 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed increase of 50c in child endowment for the third and subsequent <span class="highlight">children</span>, I believe, creates a worse anomaly as far as the income received from child endowment by a family with more than 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the first child attains 16 years of age the parents of those 3 <span class="highlight">children</span> are in this situation: The first child does not receive 50c a week but is paid $1.50 a week as a student’s allowance if he continues bis education at school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, that family with only 3 <span class="highlight">children</span> loses a total of $1 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parents of a family of 13 <span class="highlight">children</span> wrote to me and drew this matter to my attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more <span class="highlight">children</span> in a family, the greater the anomaly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned earlier, only 12,700 families in Australia have 6 or more <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>50c in the child endowment payable to each child after the first 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> would not cost the Government a substantial amount of additional funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Three of the <span class="highlight">children</span> in this family of 13 of which I have spoken are students receiving the student’s allowance of $1.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely these people could be given continuing assistance while they try to educate their <span class="highlight">children</span> and to provide for them the same opportunities as other <span class="highlight">children</span> are entitled to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Budget we find a contrast between what the Government provides to wealthy parents who can afford to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to private schools, and to other parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only <span class="highlight">children</span> of whom ( am aware who attend private schools and in respect of whom fees ranging between  S300  and  $400  a year are paid, are the <span class="highlight">children</span> of wealthy  paren’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No help is given to the State schools which cater for the vast majority of Australia’s <span class="highlight">children</span>, and where parents could not claim expenses above $50 in the vast majority of cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is how the Commonwealth Government orients its Budget towards the claims of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Young criminals get a start when they are born to drunkard parents or into families that are broken up and the <span class="highlight">children</span> are left destitute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Were  Mr James  O’Leary, his wife and their 13 <span class="highlight">children</span> recently flown to Australia at the expense of the Government of the State of Hawaii in the United States of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has not yet been determined whether  Mr James  O’Leary (alias O’Lear) and his wife and <span class="highlight">children</span> travelled to Australia at the expense  of the Government of the State of Hawaii. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additional payments for <span class="highlight">children</span> of age, invalid and widow pensioners and unemployment and sickness beneficiaries will increase by $2 per week for the first child and by $1 per week for each other child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will bring the payment to a uniform $4.50 per week for all these <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increase in child endowment will cost about $26.5m per year, and will benefit about 1,020,000 <span class="highlight">children</span> in about 610,000 families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Married rate pensioners with means as assessed between $9.50 and $11.50 per week will receive graduated increases calculated to ensure that the pension and means as assessed will total $23.75 per week - $47.50 per week for a married couple - plus, of course, any extra payments for dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not, of course, measure the whole of the  improvement,  since in addition we have brought in supplementary assistance and extra allowances for <span class="highlight">children</span>, besides introducing new fringe benefits whose average value is of the order of $5 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I now come to the provisions of the Bill which are specifically oriented towards the family and the welfare of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Endowment in respect of <span class="highlight">children</span> in institutions is paid at a flat rate of $1.50 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Child endowment is now an accepted feature of family income and for some time the Government has been concerned that the larger family has been more adversely affected by wage and price increases than the smaller family with, say, one or two <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rate of endowment payable in respect of the 20,000 <span class="highlight">children</span> under 16 years of age in approved institutions will be increased by 50c to $2 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The child endowment increases in the Bill will, as 1 have said, benefit over 1,000,000 <span class="highlight">children</span>, spread in more than 600,000 families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be remembered also that there are many other benefits and concessions provided by the Commonwealth that tend to offset the cost to parents of maintaining <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The cost to revenue of providing income tax concessional deductions for <span class="highlight">children</span>, including deductions in respect of education, exceeds some $250m per year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assistance is given to families through the National Health Act where the family insurance rates for a family with <span class="highlight">children</span> - however many <span class="highlight">children</span> - are pegged at the rate applicable to a married couple without <span class="highlight">children</span>; special assistance is also provided for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> and <span class="highlight">children</span> of pensioners - the latter being a matter which I shall deal with more fully in a moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these exemplify the attitude of a responsible government, which is to provide benefits in respect of <span class="highlight">children</span> in a way which will render positive assistance to the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now let me come to a most significant part of the Bill - a massive increase in the additional payments for <span class="highlight">children</span> of all pensioners - age, invalid and widow - and of recipients of unemployment and sickness benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The payment for <span class="highlight">children</span> other than the first, which is at present $3.50 per week, will be increased to the same uniform level of $4.50 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1961 the child’s allowance payable for the first child of invalid pensioners and age pensioners who were invalids was increased to $1.50 per week, as also was the payment for the second and subsequent <span class="highlight">children</span> of widows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1963 payments for the second and subsequent <span class="highlight">children</span> of invalid pensioners and age pensioners who were invalids, were increased to $1.50 per week and a payment of $1.50 per week was introduced for the first child of widows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Widows with dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> received a mother’s allowance of $4 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1965 the <span class="highlight">children</span> of all age pensioners were included, and a guardian’s allowance of $4 per week was introduced for single pensioners who had the custody of a child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1968, the rate of payment for all <span class="highlight">children</span> was increased to $2.50 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1969 the rate for the second and subsequent <span class="highlight">children</span> was increased to $3.50 per week, and mothers’ and guardians’ allowances were increased to $6 per week where there was a child under 6 or an invalid child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, in this present Budget, it is proposed to increase the payment for the first child from $2.50 per week to $4.50 per week, and the payment for the second and subsequent <span class="highlight">children</span> from $3.50 per week to the same level of $4.50 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have set out this history in some detail, because it shows the development of provisions under which entirely new treatment of <span class="highlight">children</span> in bereaved or deprived circumstances has been given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the position under the Chifley Government, where a widow received nothing extra for her <span class="highlight">children</span> beyond her 50c per week, and invalid pensioners got only 90c per week allowance, however many <span class="highlight">children</span> they had, we have now progressed to the point where all <span class="highlight">children</span> of pensioners - age, invalid and widow - attract $4.50 per week each; where all widows- with dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> are entitled to a mother’s allowance of $4 per week; where some widows are also entitled to an extra mother’s allowance of $2 per week, and where some invalid and age pensioners are entitled to a guardian’s allowance of $4 per week or $6 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the concurrence of honourable senators I incorporate in Hansard a table showing the position of a widow with dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>, under the provisions of this Bill: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget, as I have said, is especially oriented towards the needs of dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>, particularly towards the needs of <span class="highlight">children</span> in deprived families, where there is bereavement or invalidity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Country Party governments have pioneered several new fields such as aid to handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>, subsidies to meals on wheels and voluntary bodies; a greater programme of decentralisation of operations; a new approach to rehabilitation services; an expanded programme of aged persons housing, and a complete overhaul of the scheme of Commonwealth employees’ compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These will benefit the more seriously disabled ex-servicemen and the widows and <span class="highlight">children</span> of deceased exservicemen whose death was related to war service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Specifically the Bill provides for increased payments to ex-servicemen who are totally incapacitated from war-related disabilities or tuberculosis; to those whose incapacity allows them to work only part time or intermittently; to those who need the assistance of an attendant; to those who have lost one or more limbs or an eye; and to war widows and the <span class="highlight">children</span> of ex-servicemen whose death was related to war service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increases are also proposed in rates payable to war widows, to their <span class="highlight">children</span>, and to those <span class="highlight">children</span> who have lost both parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>related to war service, an increase of $1 a week will be payable, while the rate payable in respect of second and subsequent <span class="highlight">children</span> will be increased by $2 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

    <p>On the other hand, a TPI pensioner with a wife and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>, who also receives a service pension, but with no other means, will receive a total family increase of $5.12 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why should the increase be restricted to <span class="highlight">children</span> in excess of  2  in a family? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are families with 1 or  2  <span class="highlight">children</span> not required to meet the high costs of living that are with us today? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think the Government could have been serious when, having said that the first child should receive endowment, it says at this late stage that only families with more than  2  <span class="highlight">children</span> shall receive an increased rate of child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that in the case of the average income earner the 21 per cent increase in income tax more than takes away - note those words - the benefit of the child endowment increase of 50c a week for the third and successive <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I found that if the average income earner with 3 <span class="highlight">children</span> is on an income of $80 a week he would have a taxable income of $60 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do we give this to those who are caught up in a situation such as Attica and the resultant disaster and violence which had to be used to bring a situation under control; or are we to look to, if we have not forgotten already, the destruction and mutilation of Vietnam; or do we move further to Pakistan and the horrors and the deaths of thousands of <span class="highlight">children</span> in that country which as yet our minds do not accept; or do we go on to the Middle East, from the Middle East to Ireland, from Ireland to Africa and from Africa to South Africa? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have a personal interest in the future development of an Australian childrens film foundation or corporation or something of that nature, which will create, especially for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australia, films with a national identity, films which will provide to them the opportunities to see the excellence of our arts from our own people and also which will perhaps enrich our <span class="highlight">children</span>’s leisure in a way that is achieved by the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Film Foundation of Great Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Great Britain, the established film industry is able to support a <span class="highlight">children</span>’s film foundation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So it is that we look to government to foster the growth of this aspect of development of a <span class="highlight">children</span>’s film foundation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to see the money spent not on that type of luxury or indulgence of the teachers but on the education of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The son of question we have to consider is whether our cars are more important than our <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those countries may say: ‘Let us go without those goods and give a better education to our <span class="highlight">children</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are they in an economic position to educate their <span class="highlight">children</span> to even the insufficient standards that we are managing to achieve? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The economic fact is that out: of the capacity to produce and consume these goods comes that which we can syphon off to use in the interests of infant welfare, a better deal for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>, a better deal for education in general and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is an oversimplification of our problem to try to criticise the Government and to suggest that some of us want motor cars and not education for our <span class="highlight">children</span>, as  Senator Wriedt  so unkindly suggested in reply to an interjection by me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those of us who believe that we should produce motor cars and everything that we can produce do not necessarily believe that we should not also educate our <span class="highlight">children</span> to the fullest possible extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We realise that by manufacturing and consuming all the goods that the ingenuity of man enables us to manufacture and consume we are adding to the total economic strength of our country and our capacity to improve our standards of education by spending the’ money we can afford to spend upon our <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Should we say: ‘You are permitted to earn only $10 a week and you must stay at home for the rest of the time’; or should we say: ‘I want to see all young <span class="highlight">children</span> brought up in the best possible manner’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have the problem of people who have attempted to provide an income for themselves at the end of their working days, perhaps by putting aside some small superannuation benefit which they will gain privately as a result of having allocated to it part of their weekly earnings, as well as the problem of people who have saved to better their own position and to provide a better future for their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator emphasised one point that I was anxious to make and that is that there is an opportunity for the Government, without great expenditure, to assist the young lads and girls in our society by assisting research officers to find for these <span class="highlight">children</span> homes with real identifiable families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that those who are prepared to have this number of <span class="highlight">children</span> merit the little which the Government does under the heading of child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Originally the basic wage was viewed as a social wage which was sufficient to meet the heeds of a man, his wife and  3  <span class="highlight">children</span>, but following the basic wage inquiry in  1934  the Commonwealth Arbitration Court veered away from this earlier concept of the basic wage as a social wage and decided that it should become an economic wage which would be the highest wage that the court deemed that industry was able to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In  1941  the Chief Judge of the Court considered that on the basis of needs only the basic wage then operative was sufficient to provide only frugal comfort for a family unit of  3.  that it offered only a meagre existence for a family unit of  4,  and that if there were more than  2  <span class="highlight">children</span> a family on the basic wage would experience hardship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I mentioned in my speech on the Budget that in the case of a person who had more than  4  <span class="highlight">children</span>, when the first child reached the age of  16  years and became eligible for endowment under the student endowment scheme the family would lose a certain amount of the child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the new scheme a family with 8 <span class="highlight">children</span> under the age of 16 years will receive 17.25 a week, but if the first child becomes eligible for the student’s allowance the amount received will be reduced to $16.25 or, in other words, Si less than the family would have received had the child endowment remained and the student’s allowance not been paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the aspect of child endowment I would simply say to  Senator Drury  that it is a fact that when a child turns 16 and receives student endowment the amount received by the family in which there are more than 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> will undoubtedly decrease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Largely, the legislation 10 introduce the tax was supported as being very just, because, in a period of war and of some financial difficulties, it sought to provide the Commonwealth with sufficient funds to enable it to take over the responsibilities of making a 5s child endowment payment to all <span class="highlight">children</span> under 16 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The problem of malnutrition in India is particularly acute among refugee <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has not received any official estimate of deaths which have or might occur among refugee <span class="highlight">children</span> through malnutrition, but the Director-General of India’s Health Services,  Dr J. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was long before the Australian Government gave any aid -  to have said that more than 115,000 East Pakistani refugee <span class="highlight">children</span> were suffering from malnutrition diseases, that 110,000 were likely to die unless given immediate treatment and that another 600,000 needed supplementary foods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is generally conceded now that many hundreds of thousands of adults and <span class="highlight">children</span> have since died because of their inability to obtain normal sustenance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that I issued a statement on Thursday evening on the proposed acquisition of the Mount Gillen motel following my own visits to the Territory and very significant representations that were made to the Government in relation to problems, notably in the southern part of the Northern Territory and the Alice Springs area, in regard to hospitalisation with particular reference to Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point I want to make is this: How can anyone who has a conscientious objection to serving in Vietnam but who will serve in any other theatre of war - he does not agree with what is going on in Vietnam; he does not agree with napalm bombing of <span class="highlight">children</span> and women; he does not agree that it is other than a war of aggression in Vietnam; he does not agree that we should force a system of government on Vietnam - put his name to an alternative type of service which provides that if the Government declares a state of emergency which is approved by Parliament he shall go to Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Notwithstanding Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Committee surveys that arc now under way on certain aspects of migrant community integration, does the Minister contemplate a crash programme involving a corps of social workers to enter the area pinpointed by the Melbourne <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Hospital’s recent report and apparently defined as a domestic disaster area? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711012_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Hospital has been in touch with the Minister and his predecessor since October of last year, particularly about cases of malnutrition amongst newly arrived Turkish migrant <span class="highlight">children</span>, and other cases where there was said to be inadequate child care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711012_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was found that in some cases the <span class="highlight">children</span> were included in families which had been selected prior to the appointment of an Australian medical officer system in Turkey in August 1969 and prior to examinations being properly arranged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711012_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Royal <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Hospital has confirmed that its views on the matter were enclosed entirely in its correspondence with the Minister and it has accepted the Minister’s assurance that everything possible was done to maintain the standard of health of <span class="highlight">children</span> of those migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711012_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In common with many other women who have reached a stage where they have <span class="highlight">children</span> either at high school or at university, she feels that after a span of 25 years a sum of, say Stg50 would bc very valuable to her at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711012_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point is that by that time, as she says, the <span class="highlight">children</span> would be more or less able to stand on their own feet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711012_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I put it to honourable senators that if a black ban - it is a pretty good trade union weapon at times if it is used on the right issue - were put on some of these drug companies, and they were told that if they did not do the right thing by those <span class="highlight">children</span> who came into this world minus arms and such things, we would see some action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The voluntary code governing such advertisements was recently revised, in  co-operation  with the cigarette manufacturers, media representatives and broadcasting authorities, to both restrict the times at which cigarette advertisements may be shown and to shift the emphasis of these advertisements away from young people, particularly <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711102_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having said that it then considers that .to determine the needs of all schools we should establish an Australian schools commission - this is outlined in our policy - similar in many respects to the existing Australian Universities Commission, it would consider the needs of all the different bodies engaging in education and of the schools within the different systems of education, bearing in mind that the first responsibility is to the <span class="highlight">children</span> in the government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But 1 think that by and large, in respect of the question of school bus fares, there is, as 1 understand it, a fairly common approach to this subject on the basis that school fares over a certain distance from a school where buses are used are free and that certain administrative procedures  -  I have used these  myself in  a former capacity that 1 had1 - are adopted to ensure that the parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> travelling in excess of a certain distance in a school bus do not have to pay a substantial fare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The major element of the cost is the provision of special buses to take <span class="highlight">children</span> to and from school and school sporting fixtures, and a subsidy on school fares to and from schools in regular government passenger buses, particularly for <span class="highlight">children</span> living in rural areas of the Australian Capital Territory which are not served by private contract buses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet by advocating it and advocating that the richest person in the land shall receive a retirement allowance along with the poorest person in the land why does the Labor Party pick out and discriminate against the parents and <span class="highlight">children</span> of the independent school sector? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those high schools are providing a free service which, under the relevant Acts, is not compulsory for <span class="highlight">children</span> whose parents are as affluent as or more affluent than the parents of other <span class="highlight">children</span> who go to independent schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party’s arguments have always been that we should not pour money into systems to which the wealthy send their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Strangely enough, as I have said, members of the Labor Party do not seem too sorry if the wealthy send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to State high schools in their final years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But they do object if it happens that some few <span class="highlight">children</span> in the independent schools come from independent families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fair to say that the great majority of parents who choose to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to independent schools are of moderate to poor means, are provident and make enormous sacrifices so to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In our view, he shows an admirable conception of the need to treat <span class="highlight">children</span> in this community not as 2 separate groups according to the type of school they attend but rather as young Australians who are all entitled to fair play. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If governments were forced to find the thousands of teachers and the thousands of dollars that would be needed if the <span class="highlight">children</span> in the independent schools were forced into the government schools there would be little hope of any advancement for the government schools in Australia for SO years to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because their <span class="highlight">children</span> attend that school the parents like to help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in Great Britain, the United States of America and other countries, parents regard it as a privilege to help the school that their <span class="highlight">children</span> attend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the proposal of the Dunstan Committee - the Labor Party’s commission - it is proposed that if the parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> at a particular school work hard and provide certain facilities that will be taken as an excuse to give the school nothing and to give the money to schools where the parents say: ‘We are not going to give a penny; let the State do that’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, it is a proposal to encourage parents to regard the State as being completely in charge of education and its financing and to have absolutely no interest in the school that their <span class="highlight">children</span> attend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are schools in South Australia which are considerably in debt because the parents and the people in charge of these schools took the risk of borrowing money to provide certain facilities for the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, our committees will give the money to the schools where the parents were not prepared to go into debt and were not prepared to take risks in order to improve the quality of education available to their <span class="highlight">children</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Other speakers have said here and elsewhere, but it needs to be said again, that the Administration is supporting what we will call the dual system of education, which allows parents the choice of sending their <span class="highlight">children</span> to government or independent schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The State school systems would have very great difficulty in absorbing the <span class="highlight">children</span> who attend non-government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The neediest schools in South Australia attract a total of $34 per pupil in the primary sector and this is less than what is paid to <span class="highlight">children</span> in schools in at least 3 other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Successive Commonweath Ministers for Immigration have taken the firm view that entry into Australia of Asian <span class="highlight">children</span> whom Australian residents wish to adopt is not prohibited by an immigration policy but that it is clearly and essentially in the interests of the <span class="highlight">children</span> that the adoption plans have the approval of the expert child welfare authorities in the States concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span> have been used deliberately as articles of blackmail because the teachers have wanted something - not necessarily a further improvement in their already very good conditions but something which they thought was perhaps politically desirable or desirable for the teaching service in general. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is doubtful that their function is to use <span class="highlight">children</span> as a means of trying to impose their will on the authorities of the day, when the will of the people at election time is the right will to be imposed upon governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They may persist in using the form of blackmail of denying <span class="highlight">children</span> their right to be educated over a period, and they may continue to use the technique of rolling strikes on one day each week - for which they are docked only one-seventh instead of one-fifth of their wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>J would like to ask the Minister for Health a question concerning <span class="highlight">children</span> at risk in poisoning cases, is he aware that <span class="highlight">children</span> between the age of 1 and 5 years are those most at risk from accidental poisoning? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, has he seen that after 4 years enlightenment has struck his Department which now says that safety containers in themselves are not sufficient, nor is any one yet designed thoroughly satisfactorily but they certainly play a part in helping to protect young <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Additional amounts or allowances designed for specific purposes are also payable, separate payments are made to wives and <span class="highlight">children</span>, and many receiving the Special Rate or its equivalent are also eligible for service pensions payable under repatriation legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will, of course, realise that war widows with <span class="highlight">children</span> of school age receive considerable repatriation assistance for the education of their <span class="highlight">children</span>, right through to completion of tertiary studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Free medical and related treatment is also provided for war widows and their <span class="highlight">children</span>, as well as other fringe benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A war widow with 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> will now receive $40.25 a week from repatriation plus education allowances and fringe benefits; and if she happens to qualify for age or invalid pension, a further $27.12 a week could be payable; all service pensioners will receive an increase and, depending on various factors, such increases will range from 75c to $2.75 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the same period, most war widows have had their repatriation payments increased by $3.75 a week, or $195 a year; while a war widow with 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> has benefited by $8.10 a week, or $421.20 a year since July 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst supporting this legislation v/e add our protest against the attitude of the Government to the dependants - that is, the wife and <span class="highlight">children</span> - of persons in receipt of the general rate pension and the TPI rate pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have always pushed the argument that the current rates of child endowment have been insufficient particularly in respect to families with an excess of 2 or 3 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ask the Minister for Health another question in my continuing series of questions about the accidental poisoning of <span class="highlight">children</span> due to the use of unsafe containers for tablets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been found that even <span class="highlight">children</span> in the age group at risk - I to 5 years - have been able to open it, often in a very short period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That may guard against the careless use by <span class="highlight">children</span>, particularly in the 1 to 5 age group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us face facts: It is a very real problem in any home into which drugs are taken and in which there are <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, will the Government in its education programme consider producing television advertisements advocating that young people should not smoke and time slot such advertisements at <span class="highlight">children</span> and family viewing times, at the same time thereby supporting Australian programme productions for <span class="highlight">children</span> and family viewers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now that the publication The Little Red Schoolbook’ which has Federal Government aproval is being distributed in areas of Commonwealth jurisdiction, openly advocating sexual relations amongst school <span class="highlight">children</span>, and as there is now evidence of distribution amongst primary as well as secondary school pupils, will the Federal Government be considering altering restrictive legislation so that 14- year old schoolboys, who accept the advice of the book to defy parents and engage in such relations with the consent of 12 or 13-year old schoolgirls, will be protected from prosecution under the criminal code? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of this decision does the Commonwealth propose to refer this publication to some responsible public authority to check its suitability for distribution among school <span class="highlight">children</span> of the Australian Capital Territory and other Territories under Commonwealth jurisdiction? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Attorney-General aware of the grave concern existing among members of the Autocephalic Greek Orthodox Church because marriages performed in that church are not recognised by the Greek Government with the result that the <span class="highlight">children</span> of these marriages are looked upon as being illegitimate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think too that dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> should be released from having to pay death taxes on an estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under paragraph (e) of section 22 an age pension cannot be granted to  a  wife if she has deserted any of her <span class="highlight">children</span> under the age of 16 years and the desertion has continued during the period of 6 months immediately preceding the date of lodgement of her claim for a pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why is an Age Pension not payable to a husband who has failed without just cause to provide his wife with adequate means of maintenance or neglected to maintain any of his <span class="highlight">children</span> under the age of 16 years, when such conditions do not apply to an applicant for an Invalid Pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are any plans in hand for campaigns to promote greater care in homes concerning the accessibility of these drugs to <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure the honourable senator that I am concerned at the incidence of poisonings of <span class="highlight">children</span> but this situation is part of a world wide pattern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I recently informed senators in reply to a question by  Senator Turnbull,  my Department has been giving a great deal of attention to the consideration of safety containers and other forms of packaging drugs such as strip packaging, which would have the effect of making the ingestion of these drags in any quantity, particularly by <span class="highlight">children</span>, more difficult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To see little <span class="highlight">children</span> in institutions because of their mental retardation, the suffering of those who had been injured in industrial accidents or motor car accidents and their great desire to regain good health and to be rehabilitated in our society and the elderly invalids and their problems made me, and I am sure everyone else, realise that the greatest asset one can possibly possess is good health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am particularly concerned about handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Social Services, at the specific request of the Senate Standing Committee, carried out a survey of the number of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, it was determined that there is a minimum of 44,000 handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> under the age of 16 years in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the Government that these <span class="highlight">children</span> are entitled to all the assistance that they can possibly be given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More than anything else, it will mean that men, women and <span class="highlight">children</span> will not be merely existing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Commonwealth interdepartmental Committee was established in 1970 to commence a survey of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> and the facilities available for their use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The numbers of letters that so many of us have received asking when some of these recommendations will be implemented indicate, I think, the enthusiasm of those who are working for physically and mentally handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> to see some of the recommendations and improvements carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has only to cast one’s mind back to the days of one’s youth to realise that many of the cases which are now recognised - particularly in mental retardation in <span class="highlight">children</span> - were not even diagnosed 30 or 40 years ago - as recently as that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reading the report  1  was somewhat taken with the statement that  95  per cent of <span class="highlight">children</span> born in Victoria were taken to baby health centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But even  5  per cent of the <span class="highlight">children</span> in Victoria are not regularly taken to baby health centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One field alone which is well in my mind where early diagnosis and immediate attention can relieve a situation enor- mously is the field of deaf <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, in Victoria where 5 per cent of the <span class="highlight">children</span> do not attend public health centres there would not be 5 per cent on whose behalf child endowment is not collected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not object to the use of the steamroller by saying that child endowment will be available only to those parents who bring their <span class="highlight">children</span> in for a medical inspection at a specific age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would agree to the use of that method in the interests of the <span class="highlight">children</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those reasons, I think it is important for <span class="highlight">children</span> to be examined medically in their formative years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all it would be no sacrifice for those who decide not to take their <span class="highlight">children</span> to a public health centre or who are discouraged from doing so because they live a long distance away from one to make sure that a complete medical examination is made of their <span class="highlight">children</span> 3 or 6 months after they are born or at a particular time at which the medical profession considers it is possible for any of the abnormalities to which I have been referring to be diagnosed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another of my activities relates to handicapped Aborginal <span class="highlight">children</span> from the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take the liberty of drawing attention to chapter 6 of that report which refers to the training of what we call special teachers who handle special classes of <span class="highlight">children</span> who demand a particular form of training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All teachers in all schools educating the handicapped should have sufficient background to recognise the common learning problems of the handicapped child and should be able to refer those <span class="highlight">children</span> with the more serious problems to special classes or to special schools at a very early age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators may care to refer to the Committee’s report and its recommendations for establishing special arrangements for training teachers who will have the special job of teaching handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As medical science has improved, some pregnancies which previously might hve been aborted have resulted in <span class="highlight">children</span> who needed special care being brought into the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, I do not think it is completely relevant in this debate to point out what the Commonwealth and the States are doing for retarded <span class="highlight">children</span> or the methods currently being employed in the paramedical field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not saying that it should not be attempted, but I have in mind problems such as the movement of population in Australia, with pockets of high density population and sparse population and the fact that until this decade there was a great tendency for parents to hide retarded <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only through the wonderful work that has been done in the last 15 years by voluntary workers, by education campaigns to establish confidence in retarded <span class="highlight">children</span> and acceptance of them, that we have been able to get across the message that retarded <span class="highlight">children</span> should not be so treated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Australia we can be proud of the fact that wonderful organisations have been created to aid retarded <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I became a Minister of State, in the voluntary sense I served on a committee with a group of wonderful people who were working for and caring for retarded <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even now as a Minister, in my private capacity 1 still go to visit one place at which retarded <span class="highlight">children</span> are cared for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recommendation 22 is that those States which have not taken full responsibility for the provision of free and compulsory education for all handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> should take immediate steps to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recommendation 23 is that State authorities responsible for the design and building of schools should ensure that features are incorporated in school buildings which will enable as many of the less severely physically handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> as possible to attend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have referred to the various wings of the problem, with particular emphasis on handicapped and retarded <span class="highlight">children</span>, social services, health, education and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is satisfied that the new measures I have outlined will represent a milestone in improving the education of all Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore in the 1930s in the ghettos, in poverty that I have seen, many mothers were found with strings of <span class="highlight">children</span> but with no obvious husbands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will bring in aid for dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Government brought in a policy of aid for dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When thinking in terms of areas of poverty we should think not only of the middle aged people who have problems in raising their <span class="highlight">children</span>, problems in finding jobs or problems in providing food. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must also think of the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that in Czechoslovakia in the war years it was necessary for all women to work and for all <span class="highlight">children</span> to be put in creches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than the creation of creches, it was found necessary to finance agencies to look after <span class="highlight">children</span> while their mothers worked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggestion that we make is that some establishment should be provided in each factory for the purpose of looking after their <span class="highlight">children</span> while those women work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There arc no jobs; there is no possibility of youngsters getting apprenticeships, and facilities for higher education, particularly for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of people on low wages, are almost non-existent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that an unemployed station hand with 5 <span class="highlight">children</span> receives $47.50 a week from Commonwealth unemployment benefits whereas a station hand working 44 hours a week, under the court prescribed conditions of the Federal pastoral award, receives only $46.40 a week? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter that impressed me in  Dr Wallner’s  article was that in the United States while these older people said that they felt that they could take the drugs and leave them, the tendency was that the age at which young people experimented in drugs was falling to the degree that now - I quote her words - ‘large numbers of <span class="highlight">children</span> under 10 are being noticed in drug treatment facilities’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The drugs which they had been taking were marihuana, barbiturates and a number of other drugs which, she was told, the <span class="highlight">children</span> had said they got from the bathrooms in their homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is serious that young <span class="highlight">children</span> aged 10 and under are experimenting with drugs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact it is stated to <span class="highlight">children</span> that there is nothing very wrong with taking marihuana and that it probably will not do them much harm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the evidence that we had from medical men on what LSD can do to people, I think it is criminal that in our community there should be permitted a book which tells young <span class="highlight">children</span>, who are not equipped to make their own decisions on these matters, that it is possible to take LSD regularly over long periods without any bad effects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that kind of information is disseminated widely in the community and if it is accepted widely among <span class="highlight">children</span>, I have no doubt that if we have not a drug problem now we will have one before long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It tells <span class="highlight">children</span> that they may indulge in promiscuity and not let their parents know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It then suggests to the <span class="highlight">children</span> that if they do that, they can avoid any of the consequences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When young <span class="highlight">children</span> arc told it in ‘The Little Red Schoolbook’, I make no apology for saying that to condemn the availability of that book to young people is not bigotry or wowserism,; it is simply plain commonsense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any person who tries to enter the dairying industry today with less than $50,000 or $60,000 in cash is probably placing such a millstone around his own, his wife’s and his <span class="highlight">children</span>’s necks that he would find himself in the position in which the industry was placed in the 1930s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The position now is that the <span class="highlight">children</span> whose school lunches were then prepared, perhaps more with the idea of keeping them alive than of lifting their standard of health, have now grown to be the purchasers in Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, I think that it may be a good venture, when we are wondering what to do with our surplus stocks of dairy products, to invest some of them in, if not free distribution, almost free distribution, particularly to school <span class="highlight">children</span> in the less well-to-do countries that may in the very near future develop an economy which will enable them to become customers for these products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many who had a religious background opposed the reforms because of the poverty that would result in the families in which <span class="highlight">children</span> of  6  and  7  years of age were holding down jobs for  10  hours a day  6  days a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These reformers were sufficiently religious to demand that the <span class="highlight">children</span> be allowed off on Sundays so that they could devote that day to religious devotions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The chart shows, amongst other things, that a single male pensioner requires an additional $5 a week to reach the poverty line,  and that an invalid pensioner with a wife and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> needs and additional $15 a week to reach the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An unemployed, married stationhand with five <span class="highlight">children</span> will be better off financially living off unemployment benefits while sitting at home doing nothing, than working long hours under archaic, court-prescribed Award conditions, AWU General Secretary, Tom Dougherty, said last week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even a Stationhand with three or four <span class="highlight">children</span> certainly would not be much, if any, worse off taking into consideration the Award rates and the various deductions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, the total weekly entitlement for  a  married man with five dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> in future will be $47.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thus, the  Stationhand  had gross deductions of $12.89, leaving him a total of $33.51 a week to send home lo his wife on which she and her <span class="highlight">children</span> had to scrape by. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a question without notice on 26th April 1972,  Senator Townley  asked the Minister representing the Treasurer whether a working mother may claim an income tax deduction for costs incurred in having her <span class="highlight">children</span> looked after during her working hours and, if not, whether the Government will examine this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no specific provision in the income tax law under which a working mother may be allowed a deduction for all kinds of expenditure incurred by her in having her <span class="highlight">children</span> minded while she is at work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It takes some gall to ask a parliament, the members of which have not had an increase in salary for approximately 4 years but for whom the cost of living has gone up just as it has for every other section of the community, to award a pay rise of $84 a week, retrospective to last November, to a class of persons who have recently shown their attitude towards the rest of the community by claiming that a $2 a week increase is sufficient to overtake the rises in the cost of living and who also delivered themselves of the opinion that a man, his wife and his <span class="highlight">children</span> can live on a wage of $54 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the current case relating to the young Vietnamese <span class="highlight">children</span> the position is that the Minister for Immigration had taken the view that they ought not to be admitted or could not be admitted into Australia until he was satisfied that proper steps were being taken to maintain their welfare in Australia, and that required the consent or some indication of likely consent from the State authorities that an adoption would be recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The success or failure of the United Nations International Development Strategy, and therefore the future of millions of men, women and <span class="highlight">children</span> in the developing countries, will depend on the decisions taken at UNCTAD III and, even more important, on what governments do thereafter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the appearence of ‘The Link Red Schoolbook’, with the implication that it is to be read by school <span class="highlight">children</span>, should be an occasion when the Church says that things have gone too far and it calls on all its members to insist, through the ways open to them as citizens, that this sort of thing has got to stop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my view there can be no argument but that this book is an incitement or encouragement to school <span class="highlight">children</span> to hold all authority in contempt, and to indulge in sexual intercourse and unrestricted promiscuity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Greenwood  went on in May of last year to say that, the limitations of the new code involved a revision of the existing voluntary code and the placing of restrictions on the television advertising of cigarettes during <span class="highlight">children</span>’s peak viewing periods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Government would say that a fair proportion of this money would be spent on commercial radio and television, particularly in support of Australian produced programmes, and especially- in <span class="highlight">children</span>’s viewing and listening times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we wish to curtail the effectiveness of cigarette advertising, first we must try to reach parents to show them that this habit, expressed by indulgence in front of their <span class="highlight">children</span>, inevitably creates most fertile soil for the continuance of the habit in those <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those parents who wish to help their <span class="highlight">children</span> to resist following the habits of others by smoking cigarettes - those <span class="highlight">children</span> may consider cigarette smoking to be a social grace - can do so effectively if they take such advertisements and use them to illustrate the complete ridiculousness of the suggestions that are contained in the use of flowing water as being a cool and effective thing as related to cigarette smoking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To the Honourable the  President  and Senators in Parliament assembled, the humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectively show that the Australian Government should recognise its responsibility to the people of Australia and their <span class="highlight">children</span> and take the following action to prevent the possibility of danger to our community from the French Nuclear Tests in the Pacific: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#debate-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Treasurer’s typical family man - the average wage earner with a wife and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> - pays a higher proportion of his income in tax under the McMahon Government than under any government in our history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have assumed in these figures that the wage earner has a wife and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the 3 cases that is shown is a taxpayer with a dependent wife and 4 dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He will receive a deduction, but the significant thing is that the same document shows that this person on $67 a week actual income with a dependent wife and 4 dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> is still paying $4 a week into the Government coffers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The next page shows the case of a man on $67 a week with a dependent wife and 4 dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> but with an additional expenditure of $500 a year which is shown in concessional deductions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can any government argue that a young man with a dependent wife and 4 dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> going through the most expensive time of his life and having to pay another $500 unavoidable expenditure during the year because of misfortunes, should still be taxed at the rate of $2.50 a week? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>His  time for paying tax is when the <span class="highlight">children</span> are off his hands and when his responsibilities are not so great. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the reduction in tax payable by a married man with 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> who is earning $67 per week and claiming $500 a year as deductions is $67 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this means is that a man or a woman who wishes in his or her lifetime to make arrangements to pass his or her affairs on to his or her <span class="highlight">children</span>, will be able to do so sensibly and wisely provided action is taken within a reasonable time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A man on $7,000 a year with a wife and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> obtains a reduction of $193. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Throughout Australia, particularly outside the Australian Capital Territory, there is clear evidence that the most depressed sections of the community - the sections of the community most in need of pre-school education for their <span class="highlight">children</span>, particularly those <span class="highlight">children</span> of recent immigrants from countries where the language is not English - are deprived of a very essential advantage in the upbringing of their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By the late sixties the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the post-war baby boom who have been causing the educational crisis to date, will be the young parents of the next generation, and even if their patterns of fertility remain about the present low level - and assuming they marry in the same high proportions that have recently prevailed - the number of births will rise sharply from about 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To cope with the projected surge of pre-school age <span class="highlight">children</span> in 1974-75, as predicted by Professor Borrie, an even greater number of teachers should now be entering courses of training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The abolition of the means test will mean that these people, particularly those in middle age who do not have the responsibility of building a home or educating <span class="highlight">children</span>, will now have money available and will want to know what to do with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I had said that this would mean that people who no longer had the responsibility of building a home and educating their <span class="highlight">children</span> would be able to invest their money in the national resources of this country rather than dispense with it, or part of it, so as to be able to qualify for the pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, a taxpayer earning $67  per week and having a dependent wife and 2 dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>, but no other deductions, would have his  tax  reduced by $82.15 per annum or 22.3 per cent o his present tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we look at the percentage decreases in taxation - after all, it is the percentage decreases that are important - we find that a taxpayer with a dependent wife and 2 dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> and earning a formerly taxable income of $2,808 will now pay tax on only $2,652. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the higher brackets of taxable income - there would be very few, if any, honourable senators on this side of the chamber in these brackets - the percentage decrease on a taxable income of $18,000 for a man with a dependent wife and 4 dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> will be only 9.1. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no objection to mothers being free to work if they want to do so, but by failing to increase child endowment the Government has positively disadvantaged those mothers who wish to give full time care to their families, and particularly to their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same time, the ALP Federal Conference resolved that it should persuade Australian women not to have more than 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> - that it was selfish to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, the Budget affects everybody - the taxpayers, the pensioners, the sick, the suffering, the <span class="highlight">children</span> in our schools, the industrialists, the farmers; in fact, all people in this wonderful country in which we live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say ‘abolished’ because I believe that no government has the right to allow charities to get a large portion of an estate without paying tax when the widow and dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> are hit by that tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Should not the Government first give to widows and <span class="highlight">children</span> the benefit of any exemption that might go to those strangers in blood? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should not give them an exemption or increase an exemption and not give it to the widows and <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the migrant community <span class="highlight">children</span> require special teachers for the English language courses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is the emerging emphasis on special education for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> where again the teachers need to be trained in a certain kind of way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe they show a sensitive regard for the feelings and aspirations of young men and women who are prepared to accept the onerous task of teaching <span class="highlight">children</span> but who do not necessarily wish to be bound as bond slaves to a calling about which they may be tentative in their original approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rationale of State aid to Catholic schools is that those schools are a traditional part of our total education system to which parents who wish their <span class="highlight">children</span> to obtain a distinctively Catholic education are entitled to send them; that their continued existence relieves the burden on government schools; and that it does not amount to subsidising a religion but to furthering the educational aspects of schools where religion is also incidentally inculcated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there has been that recognition, as the evidence before our Committee showed, that Catholics can no longer sustain their education system by relying on the Catholic religious orders to instruct the <span class="highlight">children</span> in their schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I claim that the State is concerned only with neutral, objective, education standards and that anything else - the training of <span class="highlight">children</span> in the maintenance of Catholic values, or Jewish values or Presbyterian values - is peculiarly the province of those particular sects themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I can see no case for the specifically Catholic or Presbyterian training of a mathematics teacher, or a science teacher or any other expert who goes out into schools to train the <span class="highlight">children</span> in these disciplines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The slaughter by the State of Israel of innocent women and <span class="highlight">children</span> as well as others is no answer to the kind of atrocity that was committed against the State of Israel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They say that because this atrocity was committed at Munich - it was a terrible atrocity - nothing must be said and that by silence we must allow it to be thought that we accept that the State of Israel is entitled to go out and commit the kind of atrocity which was committed against women and <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is one of a series of motions which have come before the Senate and which indicate the interest of the Senate in matters relating to the education of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such a motion related to handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> - I think it was put by  Senator Fitzgerald  - and was the subject of a report by a select committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a reference already in my name to the Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts to which it is proposed to refer this matter in relation to the education of deprived <span class="highlight">children</span>, that is, <span class="highlight">children</span> who come from certain economic and geographic areas and who by virtue of some degree of intellectual starvation or lack of communication within the domestic environment, arrive at school somewhat disadvantaged when compared with their contemporaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is a matter of very great consequence, particularly to anybody who moves in the country such as honourable senators who represent the Australian Country Party and who know that in the remote areas of Australia this is of importance and great concern to the parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> living in those areas who, for financial or other reasons, are not able to see that their <span class="highlight">children</span> receive an adequate education which will equip them for the role they are to play in  life  according to their disposition and talents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of all the other problems which are of great concern to those people who are gravely distressed because of the economic recession in the rural industries, a matter which was occupying their minds with great intensity was the deprivation of educational opportunities which they felt, rightly, should accrue to their <span class="highlight">children</span> in these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we speak of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> I do not want it to be thought that we speak of the sons and daughters of very wealthy sheep graziers or beef graziers of whom some cynic might say: ‘They should have enough money themselves to provide education for their <span class="highlight">children</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that, in view of the recession in the rural industries, many of this latter group are people who, whatever might be thought of their traditional economic position in the community, today no longer enjoy that position and are finding tremendous difficulty in financing their properties and many other things, including the education of their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The submission from the Isolated <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Parents Association goes on to speak of the provision of accommodation, the cost of accommodation and what may well be provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to read into Hansard the figures contained in a table, provided again by the Isolated <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Parents Association, which sets out the numbers of what it calls white isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> in the Commonwealth who were known to the Association as at 10th April 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I presume that this table does not include indigenous <span class="highlight">children</span> - Aborigines; it refers purely to white <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is suggested that in South Australia there are 348 <span class="highlight">children</span> who might be described as isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is estimated that in New South Wales there are 2,000 isolated school <span class="highlight">children</span>, approximately 1.200 of whom are in the Western Division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Queensland there are 809 families and 2,205 <span class="highlight">children</span> made up of 469 at the preschool level, 1,038 at the primary level, 670 at the secondary level and 28 at the tertiary level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 46 split homes, 40 governesses, 194 mothers who teach correspondence in the home, 30 families that employ domestic help and 748 <span class="highlight">children</span> who live away to attend school at distances between 100 and 1,000 miles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Twenty of those 748 <span class="highlight">children</span> travel interstate, and 15 <span class="highlight">children</span> have been removed from school for economic reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provisionally, we estimate total numbers of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> in Commonwealth would not exceed 7,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This money could be expended on the provision of regional schools, the provision of accommodation near schools in remote areas and the provision of financial assistance to parents to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to school or, in the case of parents who are conducting school at home by correspondence or otherwise, financial assistance in that direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there could be taxation concessions for parents who are required to spend money on transport - by road, air or whatever it may be - or on accommodation in areas remote from the home for the provision of schooling for isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is canvassed in the submissions I have received from the association to which I have referred - the Isolated <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Parents Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will go into the matter thoroughly to find out what is the best proposal to help <span class="highlight">children</span> living in isolated areas in respect of their education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will see what can be done to give to those <span class="highlight">children</span> educational opportunities equal to those of <span class="highlight">children</span> living in more favoured areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will seek to find the manner in which these <span class="highlight">children</span> can be provided with an education suitable to their talents and interests, which will equip them for employment in the occupational field which they select. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee will inquire also into the way in which it can help to prevent these <span class="highlight">children</span> from becoming second class citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that this comparatively small number of <span class="highlight">children</span> would require a big vote out of that appropriation to enable them to enjoy chances equal  to  those of <span class="highlight">children</span> in other parts of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">children</span> do not mix with other <span class="highlight">children</span> when they are educated at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When they do mix with other <span class="highlight">children</span>, they suffer a terrible shock and they are under a considerable handicap. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span> came from 300 miles and 400 miles away for that one day of the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They met with other <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We must  get  these <span class="highlight">children</span> away from their homes  as  much as possible and enable them  to  attend schools by paying allowances to stay at hostels and subsidies to attend boarding schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is being done today with respect to Australia’s Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that a great deal of money would be required to ensure that this comparatively small number  of  <span class="highlight">children</span> had some chance to attend at boarding school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It goes a little way towards helping in sending these <span class="highlight">children</span> to hostels or to schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An allowance is paid in Queensland also - I think it applies in some of the other States as well - for the person, perhaps the mother, who drives <span class="highlight">children</span> to state schools if they are within a reasonable distance of those schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that the mother and several <span class="highlight">children</span> go into a town nearby to their home - it may be 50 miles, 60 miles or 100 miles away - to rent and use accommodation for 4 nights of the week so that the <span class="highlight">children</span> may attend school in that town. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Byrne  pointed out that this matter does not apply only to the <span class="highlight">children</span> of station managers or property owners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It applies to the <span class="highlight">children</span> of people living in scattered areas and to the <span class="highlight">children</span> of bush workers and itinerant workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It concerns those people who want their <span class="highlight">children</span> to have a fair chance of getting some education in life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must see that all Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>, wherever they live and whatever the occupation of their parents, are given the same educational opportunities to fit them for their chosen occupations in life as <span class="highlight">children</span> in more favoured areas receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This will be a conference of vital importance, certainly for at least 2,000 isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> in the State that I represent in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Frankly it is a tremendous pity that this type of motion to refer a matter to a standing committee hits to be raised a mere 3 weeks after a Budget that does not provide one cent of assistance to overcome the problems of the isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australia has been introduced by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government was approached by the Isolated Childrens Parents Association at the same time as my party was approached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that despite a Budget that was introduced giving this, that and the other to many sections of the community, there was not one cent of assistance included in the Budget to assist overcome the problems of the isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regrettable as it is, not one cent of assistance was provided in the last Budget to overcome or assist to overcome the problems of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> and their parents in the outflung and far reaching areas of my State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Wright  scowls at me, but the fact is that the vast majority of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> - not all - are in receipt of television reception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How serious is this Government when it talks about solving the problems of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> when educational television is one of the weapons at its disposal to overcome the problem? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am suggesting that if this motion is successful one of the terms of reference of the Standing Committee should be to inquire into the way in which educational television and educational broadcasting services can be utilised to a much fuller extent than they are at present, as a means of overcoming the problems of <span class="highlight">children</span> in isolated areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I recognise that <span class="highlight">children</span> in such places spend only a small part of their time undergoing education and that there could be some <span class="highlight">children</span> who could not participate in the class every day because of flat batteries in their wirelesses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are problems, however, at places like Deakin on the east-west railway where the State Government provides area buses, if possible, to convey <span class="highlight">children</span> from their homes to an area school up to 30 miles away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">children</span> return to their homes each day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not doubt that there are still some isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> who deserve consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot enter into party politics when considering this matter but no government has done more for outback <span class="highlight">children</span> than has the South Australian government, and I refer not only to the present Labor Government in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is essential that people who have to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to hostels and boarding schools should receive financial assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is because of personal connections that I have with various educational institutions that serve outback areas in their own way, particularly in my own State, but my main reason is because of my position as  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts to which it is proposed to refer this matter of education for isolated school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody who has made any study of the 2 areas concerned will be aware of the problem that exists in places served by the Isolated <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Parents Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important thing is for the Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts to recognise the urgency with which the arguments about the needs of members of the Isolated <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Parents Association have been put forward tonight and for the Committee to have some understanding of their situation, to have more than sympathy for them, and to recommend to the Senate the steps that can be taken to meet their needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has talked with State Ministers about the educational problems of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Flynn led the vanguard in the care of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He stood up for isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> long before the honourable senator thought of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Parents Association is particularly interested - the important matter of living away from home allowance, the correspondence supervision allowance, what  Senator Lawrie  referred to as the split home allowance, and government finance for the provision and maintenance of hostels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is with considerable enthusiasm that I rise to support the motion which seeks to refer to the Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts a matter as important as aid to isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> and the parents of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Living away from home allowances have been provided, certainly by the Western Australian Government, for many years to parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> who are in the situation about which we are speaking tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of example I quote the situation in the more remote part of Western Australia - the zone which attracts the highest Jiving away from home allowance for the parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> who have to be sent away from home to obtain certainly portion, if not the whole of their education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allowance in this zone - that would be the area of the north-west of Western Australia - is $300 a year, yet the charge at the hostels to which <span class="highlight">children</span> are being sent is $600 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the cheapest possible accommodation that can be provided for these <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A family which has several school age <span class="highlight">children</span> has to pay prohibitive costs just to send the <span class="highlight">children</span> to a hostel for a period - perhaps it is only for a period of their secondary education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the parents wish to give their <span class="highlight">children</span> a boarding school education the costs are far greater than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the people who are most active in the Isolated <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Parents Association are from pastoral areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In most cases they had been able to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to private boarding schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In places where we have a number of small towns developing as part of mining development throughout Australia it will be impossible to provide in each town the full range of education, both primary and secondary, which the parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> who are going to these areas would be entitled to demand for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore one must look to the development of regional schools, certainly for secondary education and the necessity to establish hostels for <span class="highlight">children</span> sent into these regional areas to complete their education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that at the present time the same Committee is investigating all aspects of broadcasting and television shows that in the course of that existing inquiry of great deal of the problem of the education of outback <span class="highlight">children</span> could be investigated and decisions arrived at. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the resolution of the Senate yesterday which referred to that Committee the question of the education of <span class="highlight">children</span> in isolated areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter of the Isolated Childrens Parents Association was dealt with in the Senate yesterday evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It occurs to me that an inquiry into the matter of education of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> is of considerable urgency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For other <span class="highlight">children</span> under 16 deductions will be increased from $156 to $208. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As is the case with the concession now provided to a parent for the education of <span class="highlight">children</span>, the maximum deduction under the new concession in any income year will be $400. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aged people and terrified women and <span class="highlight">children</span> paid with their lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Board’s requirements now call for 50 per cent of transmission time, both overall and in popular viewing time, to be occupied by Australian programmes, including 6 hours per month of first release drama presented during the 6.00 p.m. to 10.00 p.m. period and 4 hours per month of programmes specifically designed for school-age <span class="highlight">children</span> and presented at times when they have access to the receiver. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When can the Senate expect to receive the contents of a survey on the fitness of Australian school <span class="highlight">children</span> conducted by  Dr A.  W. Willee, a draft of which was completed in June 1971? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the cause of the delay due to one of the conclusions having upset Health officials because it shows that Australian school <span class="highlight">children</span> are among the most unfit in the world? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another area of protest concerns the health of Aborigines throughout Australia, particularly the health of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Infant mortality among Aborigines in some areas of Australia is 5 times to 10 times and even 12 times that of Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> of European descent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Department of Health many months ago said that it would investigate his system of providing vitamin C for young Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> to see whether this would overcome some of their health deficiencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has only to visit Aboriginal reserves in New South Wales, Queensland, the Northern Territory or Western Australia to see the deficiencies in the health of little Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> under 5 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One weeps for the future of these <span class="highlight">children</span> when one sees the chronic ear, nose and throat infections that these youngsters suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">children</span> are very much prized and loved in their families as they are in our families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot take the <span class="highlight">children</span> away from the influence of their mothers, and no-one will advocate that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if he puts a needle into the little bodies somewhere to give the <span class="highlight">children</span> the necessary treatment superstition is then introduced and the Aborigines say that this is what killed the child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we increased the amount of proper proteins a hundred-fold to these communities which are deprived of them, little would reach the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people love their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are educating the <span class="highlight">children</span> and providing the schools that are necessary to give them the knowledge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If still further proof is required of why there should be an upgrading in the personnel of the Commonwealth Council for National Fitness and why present planning should be altered for the future, we need only refer to the report, the tabling in the Senate of which we are still awaiting, of the investigation that was carried out on the physical fitness of Australian school <span class="highlight">children</span> by  Dr Willee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report shows that Australian school <span class="highlight">children</span> are amongst the most unfit in the world today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our standard of living enables us to compete in sport and yet our school <span class="highlight">children</span> are amongst the most unfit in the world today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the reasons, says  Dr Willee,  that school <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia schools are unfit is the lack of physical education facilties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increases of the same ratio have been granted in concessional allowances for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if there was any equity at all in providing such substantial relief from taxation in concessional allowances for superannuation and life assurance payments, from $400 to $1,200, I think there Ls a very excellent case for increasing the concessional allowances for wives and <span class="highlight">children</span> to $700 or $800. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At page 13 of the ‘Liberal Platform’ issued by the Federal Secretariat of the Liberal Party in November 1948 its policy had been amended to read that the adoption of a programme of progressive tax reduction was part of its platform, with special help for the family taxpayer, particularly with reference to allowances for dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>, medical and like expenses, and education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly that policy was carried out in respect of the maximum deductions for insurance, medical expenses, etc., but I do not think that on any liberal interpretation of its platform one could say that there has been a progressive tax reduction or any marked improvement in the allowances for dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> and wives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party will increase the minimum to about $2,500 because we can see that persons who have several <span class="highlight">children</span> and who are earning about $55 a week should not be paying any tax in direct form and that they should be relieved to the maximum extent of the responsibilities which have been placed upon them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only am I talking in terms of money, rather am I drawing attention to the fact that the number of <span class="highlight">children</span> who may take part in this has grown from approximately 8,000 some 2 or 3 years ago to 40,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the number of <span class="highlight">children</span> to which the Minister referred in his article which appeared in the Melbourne Herald’ tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Education and Science then dealt with another important area of education when he referred to the problems faced byAboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the current Government education programme special attention is provided for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> who, around Australia this year, will receive Commonwealth study grants to help them advance themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is firmly hoped that a large number of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> will be able to benefit from this arrangement which will cost about $3.7m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the end of the 10 weeks introduction to Army training an open day is held at the camp which parents can attend to see the advancement of their <span class="highlight">children</span> who have been conscripted into the camp. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have the names of at least half a dozen parents who will verify this story if an assurance is given to them that no disciplinary or vindictive action will be taken against their <span class="highlight">children</span> who are still in the Army. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parents, thinking that the soldiers were dispersing, rushed to greet their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While all the parents had pride in their <span class="highlight">children</span>, it was only then they learned, because of the names that the <span class="highlight">children</span> were called, that all of their <span class="highlight">children</span> were illegitimate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this is a sinister threat to the young minds of Australian school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the scheme began in 1964, some 253,000 grants totalling about $11 Om have been paid to assist young couples, and widowed or divorced persons with dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>, to own and establish their homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main provisions are: The standard rate of pension for single people and widows with <span class="highlight">children</span> is to be increased by $1.75 a week to $20.00 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This increase will apply to approximately 509,000 age pensioners, 112,000 invalid pensioners and 50,000 widow pensioners with <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The married rate of pension, which is also payable to widows without <span class="highlight">children</span>, is to be increased by $1.25 a week to $17.25 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This increase will apply to an estimated 324,000 age pensioners, 27,000 invalid pensioners and 43,000 widow pensioners without <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The effect of the easing of the means test will be to extend the amounts of means as assessed which permit the payment of full pensions by $520 to $1,040 for standard rate pensioners, including widow pensioners with <span class="highlight">children</span>, and by $910 to $1,794 for married couples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Expressed in terms of income this will mean that an age or invalid pensioner without <span class="highlight">children</span> whose property is less than $420 in value may have income of up to $20 a week and still receive the full standard rate pension of $20 a week; some pension will be payable until his income reaches $60 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Put the other way, where his means consists entirely of property an age or invalid pensioner without <span class="highlight">children</span> may have assets to the value of $10,800 and receive a full pension; some pension will be payable until his property reaches $31,600 in value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, every single age or invalid pensioner without <span class="highlight">children</span> whose pension under the present law is reduced because of the means test will, under this Bill, receive an increase of up to $6.75 a week if receiving pension at the standard rate or up to $5.60 a week, each, if a married pensioner couple without <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since 1949 the child endowment payments for the first and second <span class="highlight">children</span> have remained static. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One finds <span class="highlight">children</span> of even well to do families dropping out from the higher level of education and giving up scholarships, because despite their parents’ income, of which they are not necessarily beneficiaries, they arc denied the necessary living allowances that are made available to other members of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But why should they who were capable in their younger years of winning a specific scholarship be denied all the benefits of that scholarship, simply because their parents may at that point of time have enjoyed an income which, as I have pointed out, they may not necessarily be sharing with their <span class="highlight">children</span> who are trying to work their way through university? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>People with smaller families have to buy only one or two pens at the beginning of the school year but the mother of those 6 <span class="highlight">children</span> will be paying 5c tax on every one of those 15c pens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  in respect to the Social Service Bill we see that in the category of standard rates of pension alone the provision for single people and widows with <span class="highlight">children</span> is to be increased by 1.75 a week to S20 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government, of course, provided for increases in the child endowment rates for the third and successive <span class="highlight">children</span> in the 1971 Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Repatriation (Far East Strategic Reserve) Bill and the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Bill are designed to provide payments for <span class="highlight">children</span> between the ages of 16 and 21 years where they qualify as students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many women who were widowed in World War I or World War II, others who were widowed as a result of the Korean and Malaysian conflicts and still others who were widowed as a result of that illegal war in Vietnam, none of whom has remarried and may never remarry, are totally dependent on the ungenerous allowance that is paid by the Government by way of the war widow’s pension and whatever fringe benefits such as <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowances which may be paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the field of chilren’s allowances also the Government says that it has been very generous, in that it has been able to pay to war orphans, the <span class="highlight">children</span> who have lost their fathers as a result of war and whose mothers had previously or subsequently died, $14.70 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are a particularly unfortunate group of <span class="highlight">children</span> because had their parents not been involved in a war, at least one parent probably would still be living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, first the Government takes away her husband as a result of war, then it throws her on the physical scrap heap because it is not prepared to pay to her the type of compensation which will enable her to live in dignity and without financial worries and to bring up her <span class="highlight">children</span> in the manner available to a normal married couple. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government must remember that many World War II widows, and almost all widows who lost their husbands as a result of war in the intervening years, still have school age <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The pensions of <span class="highlight">children</span>– <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is where the real figure juggling takes place -  of deceased ex-servicemen whose deaths were related to war service will have been increased even more substantially, by 36.1 per cent in the case of a first child, and 72.9 per cent in the case of second and subsequent <span class="highlight">children</span>, . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not a case in which the Government ought to be commended because it found it necessary to increase the pensions by 72.9 per cent in the case of second and subsequent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>while the pensions of <span class="highlight">children</span> who have lost the support of both parents will have been increased by 44.8 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said a moment ago, they now receive the princely sum of about $14  -  and these <span class="highlight">children</span> have no parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I did have any criticism - I do not propose to develop this just at the moment - it is that the war widow’s pension could have gone up a little more than the increase to $20 a week that she is to receive, although I am pleased to note that the domestic allowance has gone up to $8.50 a week and the pension for <span class="highlight">children</span> of ex-servicemen is to be $7.35 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At present an estate is exempt from duty if its value is $20,000 or less and it passes to the spouse, <span class="highlight">children</span> or grandchildren of the deceased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I digress for a moment to point out to people who bleat about how much more can be done by the <span class="highlight">children</span> of aged persons - I am indebted to Dr Klugman, a learned medico in the other place - that since 1955 family contributions to national health has virtually trebled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unquestionably and desirably it would be an ideal society if the <span class="highlight">children</span> and relatives of elderly people could care for them in their homes and accept the responsibility of providing for them in the way in which, say, parents provide for their <span class="highlight">children</span> as they are being nurtured, but it is not always possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is the fact that many elderly people have not <span class="highlight">children</span> and relatives upon whom they can rely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not so long ago  Senator Hannan  raised by way of a question in this place the proposal of the Australian Broadcasting Commission to cease programming the Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television programme Adventure Island’ at the end of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I raised that matter also in the course of the debate relating to the education of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> that took place recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have received a large number of letters from people in many areas of Australia suggesting that this programme should be kept on the air, not only because it is an Australian programme but also because it is a high quality one and, probably more importantly, because it is a high quality Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television programme which informs <span class="highlight">children</span>, educates them, entertains them and imparts to them some knowledge of their own country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great number of the people who wrote to me pointed out that throughout many of the imported <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programmes there is a predominant theme of violence, vengeance, American flag waving, the portrayal of American attitudes, American values and American solutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They said that Adventure Island’ gave a very refreshing Australian point of view which educated, informed and entertained Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If that sort of thing continues to take place there is no hope for <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programmes on Australian television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>After all is said and done, the Australian Broadcasting Control Board was so concerned about the dearth of decent <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television programmes in this country that it appointed a <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programming advisory board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If lack of adequate funds for programme development is the determining factor causing the ABC to remove ‘Adventure Island’ from its <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television programming, I hope that it will consider removing some of the foreign stuff in order to continue this programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should add that it is very difficult for the parent of a child at a nongovernment school to accept the argument that everyone has the right to a complete government-provided education in a government school, but that they lose any right the moment they decide to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to a non-government school whether it be for a religious, geographic or any other reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To illustrate, the per pupil grants for 1973 will be at rates of 20 per cent of the estimated cost of educating <span class="highlight">children</span> in government primary and secondary schools, throughout Australia, during the financial year 1972-73. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth has invited the States to join with it in providing the nongovernment schools with an assured basis for assistance by themselves undertaking to make contributions towards the running costs of those schools equivalent to 20 per cent of the national average cost of educating <span class="highlight">children</span> in the government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under both the capital programmes for government and non-government schools and the recurrent grants for nongovernment schools, the Minister will be able to exercise a discretion to enable special schools, as, for example, those for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>, where the courses of study do not parallel those in Government primary and secondary schools, to qualify for assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Prime Minister announced the new policies which are to be brought into operation by this Bill, he said that they would represent a milestone in improving the education of all Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this measure, the National Parliament will accept a basic obligation to provide supplementary support for the benefit of all school <span class="highlight">children</span>, and will do so in a manner which ensures both government and non-government schools of continuing support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Supplementary food assistance has also been made available for <span class="highlight">children</span> and expectant mothers on settlement communities throughout the State of Queensland, and New South Wales continues to subsidise, from our grant, voluntary organisations working in the Aboriginal health field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In discussions with the .States it was decided that one of the main targets to be aimed at in the educational sphere during this year would be the further development of pre-schools and pre-schooling facilities so that Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> would be suitably prepared for entrance into the school system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we can be seen to be making progress, and Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> will soon be emerging from secondary schooling with educational prerequisites for higher levels of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The housing programmes aim primarily to assist families, whose <span class="highlight">children</span> will benefit thereby: a great deal of health activity is devoted to improving the health situation of Aboriginal infants and <span class="highlight">children</span>; the bulk of expenditure in education is, of course, for younger Aborigines; while the employment training scheme and other activities of the Department of Labour and National Service seek in particular to assist schoolleavers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite open-minded about this question, but these are my thoughts from what happened as I went through my own time and the thoughts of my <span class="highlight">children</span> as they went through their time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, if one takes into consideration not only the adults in a family but also their <span class="highlight">children</span>, one could say that the Democratic Labor Party represents between one million and one and a quarter million people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they are so classified, can we stop this arrant humbug that we have heard in recent months and years since the Vietnam conflict began - this nonsense, this hypocrisy that we hear from people who refer to these poor kids that are being forced into uniform, these <span class="highlight">children</span> who have to go on to a parade ground and who have to endure a sergeant major going crook at them when the only hard words they have ever heard before have come from their mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that gives no-one the right to say, no matter how old or middle aged they may be, that kids of 18 years of age are in uniform and that <span class="highlight">children</span> are leaving their parents in order to go into camp. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Government’s decision on assistance for schools, announced by the Prime Minister on 11th May 1972, propose to raise per capita payments to <span class="highlight">children</span> in non-government schools to 40 per cent of the assessed cost of educating a child in government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Following the resolution of the Senate to refer to that Committee the matter of the education of <span class="highlight">children</span> from isolated areas, the  Chairman  of the Committee,  Senator Davidson,  in answer to a question I asked of him, indicated that the Committee would give a priority consideration to this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Finally, as the  Chairman  of the Committee, I hope to attend the conference and seminar of the Isolated <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Parents Association which is to be held at Bourke tomorrow and which the Minister for Education and Science will attend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface the question by saying that no doubt the Minister is aware that capital grants are made by the Federal Government towards the establishment of hostel training centres for retarded <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of his answer to  Senator Byrne’s  question, I ask: Does his Committee intend completing its present inquiry into all aspects of radio and television before it embarks upon an inquiry into the problems confronting isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> and their parents? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Committee intends completing its inquiry into all aspects of radio and television in the first instance, can  Senator Davidson  give some indication of when the Committee is likely to commence taking evidence on the problems confronting isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> and their parents? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Douglas McClelland will recall that I indicated earlier today that the inquiry into the education of <span class="highlight">children</span> in isolated areas would take place as soon as parliamentary circumstances allowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to say the Committee does not propose to conclude its inquiry into all aspects of broadcasting and television before embarking on the reference relating to isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the nature of the reference concerning isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> is, by contrast, one which, while having a wide range of interests and inferences, is capable of receiving attention much sooner than the prevous reference, it is therefore proposed that the 2 references proceed concurrently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As soon as circumstances will allow the Committee will undertake the first steps of its inquiry into the reference put to it by the Senate relating to isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yesterday I asked the Minister for Health a question concerning a possible major increase in the bed rate subsidy to assist the running of hostels for retarded <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Department of Social Services is responsible for the administration of the Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Assistance Act 1970 which is designed to give capital assistance on a $2 for a $1 basis to approved institutions which provide residential accommodation and/ or training for the various kinds of physically and mentally handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The other form of financial assistance provided by the Commonwealth in respect of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> is a benefit of $1.50 a day, which was introduced in January 1969, and which is made under the provisions of the National Health Act for which I am responsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Tasmania has the added responsibility, when compared with the other States, of giving its <span class="highlight">children</span> the equality of opportunity that is rightly theirs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The States require not only well trained teachers who are able to impart their knowledge to the <span class="highlight">children</span> but also the establishment in the environment of the schools themselves of the standards which have been set in Canberra and which should be a yardstick for the standards to which the other States should aspire and which they should seek to maintain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the case of estates arising from deaths on or after 16th August 1972, the outright statutory exemption from duty will be $40,000 for an estate which passes wholly to close relatives - that is, a spouse, <span class="highlight">children</span> or grandchildren - and $20,000 for an estate, of which no part so passes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Duty - Amounts of Duty Payable at Present and as Proposed’, lt lists the values of estates and deals with those estates which are passing wholly to the spouse, <span class="highlight">children</span> or grandchildren, and then with estates which pass wholly to other beneficiaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have never quite understood the logic behind the fact that I can give some sort of asset, either in my lifetime or by testamentary disposition, to a charity or a school and that it should be free of tax - and free of stamp duty as likely as not - but if I leave the same asset to my wife and dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> my estate is penalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the Prime Minister’s very welcome statement that taxation concessions were to be investigated in relation to expenses incurred by fully employed single girls who are raising <span class="highlight">children</span>, I ask whether the concessions, if granted, will apply to deserted wives fully supporting <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Among other things it supports the application of taxation concessions to minimise the incidence of death duties so as to avoid the necessity for the forced sale of family property where the estate is left to the wife and <span class="highlight">children</span> of the testator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apparently  Senator Hannan  believes that the Australian troops should be still in Vietnam destroying these terrible people of Vietnam - these women, <span class="highlight">children</span> and old people - and that we should be gaoling all the people in Australia who oppose this principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Attorney-General to use any clemency he can show or any discretion he has to allow this mother of 2 young <span class="highlight">children</span> to be released from gaol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is not too late, I plead with the Attorney-General to show some compassion in this matter, at least to give  Mrs McLean  credit for having the courage of her convictions, and at least recognise that she is the mother of young Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> and allow her to go home to those young Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> rather than suffer indignity under a law which, as  Senator Cavanagh  says, is not upheld by some 60 per cent of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At end of motion add: ‘, but the Senate, while not refusing a second reading to the Bill, is of the opinion that it should provide for the establishment of an Australian schools commission to examine and determine the needs of students in government and non-government primary, secondary and technical schools, and recommend grants which the Commonwealth should make to the States to assist in meeting the requirements of all school age <span class="highlight">children</span> on the basis of needs and priorities and that the application of this policy could not allow the continued acceptance of the provisions of the Bill and that therefore grants should not be made on the basis provided in the Bill in respect of any year after 1973’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have claimed all along that there is no difference between people in the lower income groups who are sending <span class="highlight">children</span> to independent schools at Ashfield and Burwood, and their fathers and their fathers before them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If somebody has the good fortune to become a young executive at 25, at 35 he is in a good position to send his <span class="highlight">children</span> to the higher class schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The term ‘private enterprise’ or the term ‘Canberra bureaucracy’ does not mean a thing to parents whose <span class="highlight">children</span> attend some of the schools which I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether the <span class="highlight">children</span> attend Kogarah High school or the Christian Brothers high school at Burwood, their parents are in the same lower and middle income groups and they do not get the little fringe benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, it is the prior right of parents to choose the kind of education they want for their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the State has the right to ensure or to insist that <span class="highlight">children</span> are educated to a standard that will fit them for good citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, all Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> ought to be equal under the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some 100 years all Australian governments were taxing all the people to provide education for all the <span class="highlight">children</span>, but directing all the moneys so derived to state schools and denying any moneys to private schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to the credit of the Party to which I belong that for the last 16 years it has fought consistently for the right of parents to choose the school and the kind of education they want for their <span class="highlight">children</span> without discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable senator agrees with the right of parents to choose the kind of education they want for their <span class="highlight">children</span>, surely he must agree with the Democratic Labor Party when it says that it is wrong in principle and unjust to penalise parents who exercise that right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I am saying is that when public moneys are set aside for education they ought to be spent equally on all <span class="highlight">children</span> without discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this place it was not so long ago that we discussed the education of outback <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went along to the Minister in a very sincere and, 1 may say, humble way to request the South Australian Government to devote more money to the education of outback <span class="highlight">children</span> in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have only my friend’s statement to support this, but according to him the Minister said: ‘If we gave you extra money for the education of the outback <span class="highlight">children</span> you would probably spend it on booze.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a tremendous pity that personalities relating to political people have entered into this discussion because this is a matter of great national importance to every Australian child, not just the <span class="highlight">children</span> of individual members of any section of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can say, as a father of <span class="highlight">children</span> who attended State schools - 2 of them have passed through State schools and are now at university and another is attending a State school in New South Wales - that the standard of State school education in New South Wales is much lower today than it was 6. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are not sufficient teachers to cater for the number of <span class="highlight">children</span> attending the school system to enable classes to be a reasonable size. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Advertisements appear from time to time in the newspapers urging people to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to the greater public schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in that respect there is a shortage in the number of teachers available to teach the <span class="highlight">children</span> and therefore there is inequality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a tremendous disparity in the number of <span class="highlight">children</span> in the classes and therefore again there is inequality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great number of such <span class="highlight">children</span> are receiving private tuition at the rate of$1 95 a quarter or whatever the charge may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that for the system of education existing in Australia for all <span class="highlight">children</span> there should be established an Australian schools commission to iron out on a national basis where the principal needs are so that a system of equity can be brought about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having ascertained the priority of needs in order to bring about some standard of equity in the educational system, it will then recommend grants which the Commonwealth should make to the States, cutting out all this malarkey about centralisation and unification to assist andto meet the requirements of all school age <span class="highlight">children</span> on the basis of needs and priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am proud that the Government through this legislation is introducing a programme to assist the States financially for education purposes in order to ensure that all Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> will obtain the best education that is possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The parents of those students would have to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to state schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe in the right of parents to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to whatever type of school they choose, br that school an independent one or a government one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Much was m: de tonight of the fact that wealthy people send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to independent schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 know of many people who work for a living, who are not wealthy and who wish to give to their <span class="highlight">children</span> the opportunity to attend an independent school, whether this he for religious or other reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people work very hard and save their money in order to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to independent schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not agree with the argument put by the Opposition that it is only the <span class="highlight">children</span> of wealthy parents who attend independent schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mothers, fathers and even <span class="highlight">children</span> have worked to help te enable those schools to continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the schools which they support are entitled to some financial assistance from the Commonwealth to ensure that their <span class="highlight">children</span> enjoy the same facilities as those provided in government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this debate the important point has been missed; that is that we are considering <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether they go to private or public schools, we have to consider the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we look at it as a whole we see that those involved are not merely those <span class="highlight">children</span> who go to one or two schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard a lot recently about country <span class="highlight">children</span>, and they are a group that we must look at. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must consider also Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>, deaf <span class="highlight">children</span>, spastic <span class="highlight">children</span> - there are examples of spastic <span class="highlight">children</span> who can benefit from university education, if they are given the opportunity to do so - <span class="highlight">children</span> suffering from dyslexia, and migrant <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately this Government has not insisted that migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> speak English, and some of them who have attended school have been unable to grasp the language because of their natural shyness and so drop back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He went along to the Minister in a very sincere and, I may say, humble way to request the South Australian Government to devote more money to the education of outback <span class="highlight">children</span> in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have only my friend’s statement to support this, but according to him the Minister said: ‘If we gave you extra money for the education of outback <span class="highlight">children</span> you would probably spend it on booze’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The following are extracts from the letters - We were made aware of your complete lack of interest in the educational welfare of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the outback.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr M.  I. McTaggart presented a report on the deputation to the Minister of Education on 23rd June 1971 seeking financial assistance for outback <span class="highlight">children</span> doing correspondence lessons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We accepted this point and then requested an allowance to families of non-attendance school <span class="highlight">children</span> similar to the allowance of $200 per year in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that at that point the delegation referred to the fact that not only <span class="highlight">children</span> of station owners but many <span class="highlight">children</span> of station hands and Commonwealth Railways fettlers were encountering the same problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister replied that where parents were conscientious they would complete primary education and then possibly living away help was required to help brighter <span class="highlight">children</span>, but that there is now a reasonable allowance for secondary students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said that they would not start hostels similar to those in other States, and so we asked if he could give any assistance at all to outback <span class="highlight">children</span> and received no sympathy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister pointed out that the scheme of the South Australian Government for the outback <span class="highlight">children</span> is possibly one of the most generous schemes in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives more to the parents of the outback <span class="highlight">children</span> than does any other scheme in  operation in any State of Australia under a Liberal dominated government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the correspondence I have received from the parents of outback <span class="highlight">children</span> has requested some concessions in the form of taxation deductions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to school receive an allowance for school fees, but a person who cannot send his <span class="highlight">children</span> to school cannot receive the allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides an allowance for the <span class="highlight">children</span> who attend school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It permits a child to attend school, and gives them a better opportunity than have outback <span class="highlight">children</span> in the other States of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, these education grants cannot be made available until a child reaches 14 years of age, and there are many youngsters attending primary school whose parents need financial assistance to keep the <span class="highlight">children</span> at school in order to give them a reasonable education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that environment the <span class="highlight">children</span> and the infants were regularly breast fed until they were 4 or 5 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we can understand now from our knowledge of nutrition, in the new environment the <span class="highlight">children</span> gradually have been lacking the nourishment that was required to sustain them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They caught lizards, grubs and moths, all of which the infants and very young <span class="highlight">children</span> ate as they were caught - raw. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These people love their <span class="highlight">children</span> as much as any other human race loves its <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps they love their <span class="highlight">children</span> more because they live closer to them and they will not be separated from their <span class="highlight">children</span>, whether we like it or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is true that their <span class="highlight">children</span> are dying at a higher rate than ever before in history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not have any crime figures for Aborigines or Europeans, but I do recall that a person by the name of Namatjira was thrown into gaol for 6 months because he dared to give one of his <span class="highlight">children</span> a drink of wine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In discussions with the States it was decided that one of the main targets to be aimed at in the educational sphere during this year would be the further development of preschools and pre-schooling facilities so that Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> would be suitably prepared for entrance into the  school  system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>to minimise the incidence of death duties so as to avoid the necessity for the forced sale of family property where the estate is left to the wife and <span class="highlight">children</span> of the testator; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is there progressive cover according to the number of dependants under the Australian Labor Party’s scheme so that a man supporting a wife and six <span class="highlight">children</span> on $58.30 per week receives free cover but under the Government plan is required to pay full contribution of $1.66 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the Labor Party health proposals, low income earners supporting a family with one or more <span class="highlight">children</span> would be automatically covered at public expense where their taxable income does not exceed $1,700 per year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government initiative is a tangible expression of its very real and proper concern for the welfare of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Included in the concept ‘good quality’ are both the physical arrangements and the professional staffing, in the provision of which the overriding consideration will be the emotional, intellectual and physical development of <span class="highlight">children</span> in child care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation expresses the Government’s recognition of the rapidly increasing proportion of married women in the labour force and of the consequences of this phenomenon for the care of their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is known that at the present time over 25 per cent of mothers with <span class="highlight">children</span> under the age of 6 are in the labour force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of these mothers are engaged in paid employment in their own homes and care for their <span class="highlight">children</span> at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are over 150,000 pre-school aged <span class="highlight">children</span> whose mothers, or single fathers, work outside their homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most importantly, they revealed that child care facilities had not kept pace with the rapid growth in the female labour force during the 1960s, and that, as a consequence, existing child care facilities were inadequate, qualitatively and quantitatively, for the growing numbers of <span class="highlight">children</span> needing them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only were there too few centres but in many cases the provision was only for child minding and not for the quality of child care appropriate to the educational, emotional and developmental needs of the young <span class="highlight">children</span> involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During this examination the committee had the benefit of consultations with State government departments and with representatives from a wide range of local government, professional and voluntary groups and organisations throughout Australia concerned with day care arrangements for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While many working mothers were able to make satisfactory arrangements for their <span class="highlight">children</span> during working hours, a substantial number were not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary, the Government decided that action was urgently needed: action lo ensure sufficient good quality child care facilities in the community for the proper care and development of pre-school aged <span class="highlight">children</span> whose parents or guardians are unable, for a variety of reasons, to make other suitable arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These facilities should be available at a cost that is not prohibitive to parents, especially to parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> in special need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme is forward-looking and includes provision to stimulate research into all factors relating to the needs of the community in relation to the care of <span class="highlight">children</span>, and for experiments in various child day care methods, lt is the Government’s intention to ensure an ongoing evaluation of both the short-term and longterm effects of the measures which this Bill will make possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it is the view of authorities concerned with child care, for example the Child Psychiatry Section of the Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, that alternate care, provided for young <span class="highlight">children</span> while their mothers are working, which is inadequate and unsatisfactory, can contribute to emotional disturbance in the child’s later years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of particular concern is the situation where young <span class="highlight">children</span> are left in the care of untrained and unsupervised child minders who do not have the facilities conducive to the social and emotional development of young <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, many young <span class="highlight">children</span> are being taken care of in just such circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the Government’s initiative springs from its concern for the welfare of <span class="highlight">children</span> of working mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also a fact that at present 25 per cent of mothers with <span class="highlight">children</span> under 6 years of age are in the labour force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That a substantial number of such mothers cannot make satisfactory arrangements for the care of their pre-school aged <span class="highlight">children</span> is yet another fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the scheme is to meet this existing problem - to help the <span class="highlight">children</span> of working and other parents insofar as they are deprived of proper child care either because good quality facilities are not available or because the cost is presently too high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary, the Bill provides for assistance to non-profit organisations, including local governing bodies, to establish and operate centres which provide day care for <span class="highlight">children</span> of working and sick parents and which give priority of admission to <span class="highlight">children</span> in special need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this purpose <span class="highlight">children</span> in special need are defined in clause 20 of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed scheme has four main elements, as follows: (i) capital grants; (ii) recurrent grants in respect of qualified staff; (iii) recurrent grants with respect to <span class="highlight">children</span> in special need; and (iv) grants for research and evaluation of matters relating to child care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where there are  15  or more <span class="highlight">children</span>  3  years of age or over enrolled full-time, the grant will be in respect of one pre-school teacher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the first  20  <span class="highlight">children</span>  3  years of age or over, the grant will be in respect of one qualified nurse for every  20  <span class="highlight">children</span> or part thereof. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is provision for grants in respect of additional pre-school teachers in child care centres accommodating more than a prescribed number of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Younger <span class="highlight">children</span> under  3  years of age have other and more demanding needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The grant will be available for a qualified nurse employed in a centre for every  10  such <span class="highlight">children</span> or part thereof for which the centre has enrolments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of <span class="highlight">children</span> in this context refers to <span class="highlight">children</span> enrolled for  8  hours during the day in a centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill includes provision for the calculation of the grant to be made in such a way as to take into account the varying hours that different <span class="highlight">children</span> might attend centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus under the scheme, opportunities will exist for <span class="highlight">children</span> aged between  3  and  5  years in child care centres to receive pre-school education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recurrent Grants with respect to <span class="highlight">children</span> in special need <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for special recurrent grants to enable centres to offer reduced fees in respect of enrolled <span class="highlight">children</span> from low income and other families in financial need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fees normally charged to parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> not in financial need will be of the order presently being charged in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For these fees, however, <span class="highlight">children</span> will enjoy in government assisted centres  a  quality of care superior to that otherwise available because of the nature of the facilities and the qualified staff provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basis of the method will be that an organisation operating a centre will receive payments with respect to <span class="highlight">children</span> in special need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this purpose, ‘<span class="highlight">children</span> in special need’ is defined in the Bill - clause  12  - as <span class="highlight">children</span> of one parent families, of families in the first  3  years of settlement in Australia, of families where one of the parents is sick or incapacitated, and of families eligible to receive assistance under the subsidised health benefits scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The circumstances of families placing <span class="highlight">children</span> in child care centres cannot be predicted in advance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a scheme of this nature, that relates to the development and care of <span class="highlight">children</span>, every opportunity must be made to ensure that organisations assisted can operate their child care centres with compassion and with the capacity to help the most needy cases as they arise from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, it will be the responsibility of organisations operating centres to balance their own financial budgets, taking into account the recurrent grants that will be made available - both in respect of staffing - and with respect to <span class="highlight">children</span> in special need the fees they can collect, and their other sources of income, if any, against their outgoings for salaries, maintenance of equipment and buildings and other current expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to accept applications for enrolment of <span class="highlight">children</span> in special need in priority to applications relating to other <span class="highlight">children</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Centres will need to provide programmes of pre-school education for <span class="highlight">children</span> as appropriate; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Persons in charge of centres will be required to seek the co-operation of family counselling and other local social welfare agencies including those operated by local governing authorities, especially in cases of family disruption and where parents or guardians are seeking to place very young <span class="highlight">children</span> in centres; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hoped that it will be possible to include officers of relevant State Government departments who can advise on the facilities that should be provided, on the best approach to the development of <span class="highlight">children</span> in centres, and as to the geographical areas that are in greatest need of additional child care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second expression of the Government’s concern about future developments is the provision for research to explore the very large field of child care, particularly as it relates to day care, and related areas such as after-school and holiday care for school-aged <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also worthy of study is the motivation for mothers of young <span class="highlight">children</span> to continue to care for their own <span class="highlight">children</span> in their own homes rather than to enter paid employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in this regard what is the persuasive influence of appropriate family counselling on mothers of young <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a view, for example, that new forms of training are required to meet the needs of <span class="highlight">children</span> in child care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span> of preschool age should not be deprived of proper care, and the opportunity for the fullest possible development, because their parents are not looking after them themselves at home during the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude of the working mother is that her presence in the community is a fact and that assistance with the care of her <span class="highlight">children</span> is a need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The evaluation will reveal what is happening in the centres and what their impact is on the community, on the families involved and on the <span class="highlight">children</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is basic therefore, that the physical conditions in the centres facilitate and encourage the participation and involvement of parents in the care and development of their <span class="highlight">children</span> at the centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One responsibility of the child care standards committee will be to examine designs for centres to ensure that they incorporate physical features which parents placing their <span class="highlight">children</span> in a centre can use as a community service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More precisely, parents will be encouraged to see the centre as a place to which they can come to discuss the development of their <span class="highlight">children</span> with other parents, with the staff in the centre and with qualified professional people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government envisages that if a beginning can be made to turn this legislation into reality quickly, we can look forward to an increase of at least 20 per cent per annum over the next 3 years in the number of places for pre-school <span class="highlight">children</span> that will be available in child care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In today’s mobile society with families living apart from grandparents and other relatives, there are many who have nowhere to turn when they are ill or in need of assistance with their <span class="highlight">children</span> during the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Child care centres have to be seen in their proper perspective; they are supportive of the family unit and in extreme cases are the alternative to placing <span class="highlight">children</span> in residential institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Parliament will take immediate steps to ensure that finance from the Commonwealth will be given to the States for their public education services which provide schooling for seventy-eight per cent of Australia’s <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span>’s and orphan’s pensions in both the DFRB and superannuation schemes are expressed as fixed amounts, although there is an alternative basis for assessing orphans’ pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why is an age pension not payable to a husband who has failed without just cause to provide his wife with adequate means of maintenance or neglected to maintain any of his <span class="highlight">children</span> under the age of 16 years, when such conditions do not apply to an applicant for an invalid pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When one considers that at the present time there are 1,261,610 <span class="highlight">children</span> under 4 years of age in Australia, one can appreciate the great and urgent need to provide child care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this rate, clearly millions of young <span class="highlight">children</span> in our community will not have the advantages of a proper child care relationship with their mother and with other <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A great deal of research has been carried out into the area of <span class="highlight">children</span> under 5 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It recommended that mothers of young <span class="highlight">children</span> should be encouraged to spend as much time as possible with young <span class="highlight">children</span> or, if there are economic pressures that require a mother to go to work, then governments need to give consideration to the provision of special allowances in the form of financial relief to a mother so that a mother is not separated from a child under  4  years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, if a government were sincere it would give a substantial allowance to those mothers who would otherwise elect to go to work, to stay at home to care for their young <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true, having regard to the state of health of the mother or the state of home and tensions, that some <span class="highlight">children</span> would benefit from the tensionfree environment which they would probably find in a child care centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government shows its contempt for the intelligence of the people of Australia when it slates that this Government’s initiative is a tangible expression of its very real and proper concern for the welfare of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The New South Wales Child Welfare Department has expressed concern at the number of unqualified and often indifferent housekeepers and nannies who are caring for <span class="highlight">children</span> in their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have seen and heard of sick <span class="highlight">children</span> being bundled out of their homes to be handed over to untrained people to be minded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion a number of these <span class="highlight">children</span> are not adequately fed or cared for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this makes the <span class="highlight">children</span> feel unwanted and insecure and that they will be the problem <span class="highlight">children</span> in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other <span class="highlight">children</span> not being given any real consideration by the people whose responsibility it is to look after them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sometimes <span class="highlight">children</span> are left in their homes while a parent working at a nearby factory has an arrangement with the factory to go every so often to check whether they are alive and well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the New South Wales Department of Child Welfare existing child care centres cater for only 2.8 per cent of pre-school <span class="highlight">children</span> and only 6 per cent of 3 to 5-year-olds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sweden, a frontrunner in this field, aims at catering for 80 per cent of pre-school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we should also consider the granting of a special allowance to mothers of <span class="highlight">children</span> under 3 years old, as is done now in some of the more advanced countries such as Hungary and Austria, so that the financial pressures which force women to work during this period are eased, if not removed altogether. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That treatment brings into sharp relief the failure of the Government to pay decent allowances to young mothers to encourage them to stay with their <span class="highlight">children</span> in the early formative years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issues of a Bill of this nature are not just those concerned with the caring of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While there is a shortage of places in child care centres, we agree that priority should be given to the <span class="highlight">children</span> of working mothers and that special arrangements should be made to enable the closest relationship between the working mother and the child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present about 25 per cent of mothers with <span class="highlight">children</span> under 6 years of age are working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there are still over 150,000 pre-school <span class="highlight">children</span> whose mothers work outside the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason I believe that the Government has needed to give attention not only to the matter of child care facilities but also to the introduction of a measure which will provide adequate child care facilities for these 150,000 pre-school age <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is not an inducement by the Government to encourage women with preschool age <span class="highlight">children</span> to enter the work force, but rather I see it as a Government reaction to the social change which has already occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is necessary to look at some of the terms of this Bill and perhaps relate them to the requirements of Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> and the working mothers of the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that we shall have a child care standards advisory committee, I believe, will give continuing relevance to the needs of the <span class="highlight">children</span> and to the needs of the working mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have very much a family structure of parents and <span class="highlight">children</span> rather than the other generations which are involved in some other countries of the world in close living conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advisory committee and the research committee seem to me to be 2 aspects of the Bill to which 1 can give support; because whilst there are some 150,000 <span class="highlight">children</span> who need day care while their mothers are working as a result of social change, T would like to think that we would evaluate, too, the implications of the mother of the pre-school child being employed outside the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this Bill it is hoped to establish some 50 new centres catering for, perhaps, 3,000 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the prospect of 150,000 <span class="highlight">children</span> in the preschool group, the provision of 3,000 child care places in the first year does seem to be rather limiting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill will provide half of the salaries as an incentive to the centres to provide the qualified staff which could offer the best type of care and the most intelligent interpretation of their role as people who are caring for <span class="highlight">children</span> for some hours each day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason I welcome the provision  in  the Bill that facilities  will  be given  in  priority to those <span class="highlight">children</span> who have special needs  or  to- those parents who have special needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">children</span> of mothers who are unable to care for them or  of  the single male parent who is occupied in earning income for the family will need to have  Specialised  care such as we envisage  will  be provided under this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one considers the opportunity to give priority to <span class="highlight">children</span>  in  special need; if one considers the fact that we are establishing a research programme which we believe  will  be a continuing process and which will take  into  account the future needs of Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> in their own conditions; and  if  one understands that there are these grants to give an incentive to the centres to employ trained staff, then I think honourable senators will agree that the Government has approached what is a social concern in a very practical way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is using this opportunity to set a pattern  of  child care centres which  We  hope will be  of  advantage to <span class="highlight">children</span>, which will enable the mother to  make  her choice as to whether she combines her role of mother and some career. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was of great interest to me to have, the opportunity to talk to someone who had been engaged in the supervision of the Government’s child care centres in Finland for some 30 years, I think, and to hear of her experiences and her understanding of this facility which has been provided in that country where the proportion of married women who work and have pre-school <span class="highlight">children</span> is very high indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 hope that the S23m programme which has been announced by the Government will be interpreted intelligently, wisely and with due regard for the needs of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the research will provide a means of establishing a type of facility which will not be of emotional detriment to the very young <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a father who has found no generation gap in his family because it was never allowed to develop, 1 shudder when I hear people talk of <span class="highlight">children</span> under 5 years of age and of the tender age of 3 years being placed in the hands of trained staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably, if we searched the statistics, we would find that these young people arc from well adjusted homes and are not <span class="highlight">children</span> who went to part time orphanages which are now given the very special name of child care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have tried to take <span class="highlight">children</span> out of institutionalised circumstances when, because of fate, they have no parents of their own to love them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I listen to the alleged experts who are suggesting that we must institutionalise the care of <span class="highlight">children</span> where people are forced by circum stances - and even where it is their own desire - to abandon a 3-year-old child for 8 hours a day 5 days a week to the care of an institution with expert, trained staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a child runs to a well trained expert - who has no personal interest - al the same lime as, perhaps, 10 or 15 other <span class="highlight">children</span> do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are such circumstances it is regrettable that we have to create these places rather than having those <span class="highlight">children</span> cared for in circumstances similar to those which we try to provide for orphans, which is in a home atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The average mother who has one or two <span class="highlight">children</span> might not be specially trained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From my experience in dealing with <span class="highlight">children</span> as a parent, I think this is far more important than knowing the germ content of the water which they may drink. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the destiny of the child who comes home after 8 hours in a child care centre to a mother who is exhausted by 8 hours of employment in a factory or a shop and who is faced with preparing tea for her husband and one, 2 or 3 <span class="highlight">children</span> as well? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely in our grandparents generation we had begun to move away from the ideas of placing in orphanages <span class="highlight">children</span> who were faced with the necessity of being reared by the State because their parents had died or had abandoned them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However many mothercraft nurses there are, when a child is taken to a child care centre where there are a number of ot’-.er <span class="highlight">children</span> and trained scientific staff, it is in an institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If  Senator Georges  has abandoned his <span class="highlight">children</span> to this type of rearing I hope he will not suffer the recriminations that many do when they find that there is a generation gap. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In those days people played their role in life and a mother was with her <span class="highlight">children</span> in a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it putting the wiggle on top of a chocolate all day and sacrificing the enormous love and affection that her <span class="highlight">children</span> can develop for her? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We do not believe that taking <span class="highlight">children</span> of 3 years of age and treating them as subjects for education and science would greatly improve child care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have made suggestions that child care centres should be less institutionalised where such care is unavoidable where mothers or widowed fathers are forced to have their <span class="highlight">children</span> cared for by somebody else during certain vital hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, if the assistance provided is aimed purely at those <span class="highlight">children</span> who are in need insofar as the assets and background of their families are concerned, there will be created an institution for purely that type of child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Centres which receive Commonwealth assistance must, according to the Bill, give priority of application to <span class="highlight">children</span> in special need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The immediate consequence of this requirement is that Commonwealthassisted centres will accommodate a disproportionate number of such <span class="highlight">children</span> in special need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These centres will then take on the special characteristics appropriate to such <span class="highlight">children</span>, rather than be a reflection of the crosssection of the community within which the <span class="highlight">children</span> are growing up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus will be generated the undesirable ghetto kind of centre which we have previously mentioned to you (in a letter from the Victorian Association) - a characteristic which we argue is quite unacceptable for all except those <span class="highlight">children</span> who really need specially protected care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill as now proposed has immediately put into jeopardy the whole private-commercial sector of the child care field - that is, all those centres which at this point of time are caring for the vast majority, (estimated at more than 80 per cent) of all <span class="highlight">children</span> in day care in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot be in the national interest that Parliament should design this important and desirable Bill in such a way as to lead to the destruction of such a large proportion of the existing child care field, with its consequent effects on the interests of hundreds of proprietors of child care centres, thousands of staff engaged in those centres, and tens-of-thousands of parents whose <span class="highlight">children</span> attend these centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The pre-school system in Canberra which caters for a large number of <span class="highlight">children</span> does not take the <span class="highlight">children</span> for more than half a day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a situation in which the mother has to work and an endeavour is made to give that mother some assistance by looking after the <span class="highlight">children</span> while she is unfortunately unable to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a Bill for an Act to provide for assistance by the Commonwealth in respect of places where <span class="highlight">children</span> under school age may be cared for during the day and in respect of research in connection wilh the care of <span class="highlight">children</span> and for related purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard in a quite interesting debate a number of comments by way of support for the project - I think that has been the general view of the Senate - but also we have heard reservations as to whether or not particular lines of development are the best lines upon which the minding of <span class="highlight">children</span> whose parents are unable to look after them throughout the day should proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention in passing that  Senator Little  suggested that there might be centres in which there is provision for <span class="highlight">children</span> to be minded in the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Little  thought that some provision may be made whereby families can take into their homes <span class="highlight">children</span> of working parents and other parents who cannot look after them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed child care sheme is concerned with the welfare of <span class="highlight">children</span>, with particular emphasis on the welfare of those <span class="highlight">children</span> who have special need of alternative care while their parents are working, sick or otherwise unable to care for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a scheme which is designed to encourage mothers and those responsible for the caring of <span class="highlight">children</span> to put their <span class="highlight">children</span> into these centres and go out to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the scheme is designed to meet is the existing problem of working mothers and others who are unable to give their <span class="highlight">children</span> the care that they require throughout the day and to provide a means whereby that care can be provided better than it is being provided at the -moment, to have the proper physical arrangement where <span class="highlight">children</span> can be looked after, to provide the professional staff who can give the appropriate attention and to do something which is not existing  at  the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The initial research was commenced in 1965. and I think most honourable senators will recall that in late 1968 a document was published by the Department of Labour and National Service concerning the <span class="highlight">children</span> of working mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will also be remembered that  Mr Gorton,  as Prime Minister, during the Senate campaign at the end of 1970 indicated that the Government intended to introduce a scheme of assistance in respect of child care centres for <span class="highlight">children</span> of working mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any such organisation, however, would need to offer priority of admission to <span class="highlight">children</span> in special need and to be open to serve the community, and not restrict entry into the child care centre to <span class="highlight">children</span> of employees in a certain industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The child care scheme, moreover, is not restricted to <span class="highlight">children</span> of working mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span> of single fathers and <span class="highlight">children</span> of parents who are sick and incapacitated or who are otherwise unable to care for their <span class="highlight">children</span> during the day are eligible for admission to the centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That College gave great co-operation and provided guidelines which will be followed for the care of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have stressed, and I repeat, that the whole scheme is aimed at the proper care and development of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the scheme is to rectify a problem that already exists, namely, that a large number of <span class="highlight">children</span> are currently being left in a number of unsatisfactory centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time there are 150,000 pre-school <span class="highlight">children</span> who have mothers who go to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of these women have to make arrangements for the care of their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Guilfoyle  pointed out in her appreciation of this measure the number of 3,000 <span class="highlight">children</span> who could be accommodated in centres in the first year of the scheme’s operation does not seem to be a very large overcoming of the existing problem as we see it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is expected that those who are in a position to pay for having their <span class="highlight">children</span> cared for in those centres will pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ages of the 4 <span class="highlight">children</span> in the family range from 24 years to 7 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Acting on medical advice, the mother of these <span class="highlight">children</span> decided earlier in the year to go to Greece to see whether that would aid her health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both the father and mother of the <span class="highlight">children</span> are naturalised Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of the <span class="highlight">children</span> were born in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mother and the 4 young <span class="highlight">children</span> have returned to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The mother and <span class="highlight">children</span> have to rely on the State Welfare Department for sustenance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The young <span class="highlight">children</span> are fretting for their father, and the mother is also fretting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the father of the <span class="highlight">children</span>, whose name is Dimitrious Lekatis, called at the Australian Embassy in Athens on 3 occasions, he was told there that they could do nothing about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that  Mr Lekatis  would be detained in Greece and separated from his wife and young <span class="highlight">children</span>, who have no income other than what they are receiving from the State Welfare Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill provides for a payment by the Commonwealth for the care of <span class="highlight">children</span> under school age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The AttorneyGeneral said that a position exists where <span class="highlight">children</span> are being neglected at present while their parents are out working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the love and affection of parents in Australia today is such that, with rare exceptions, they will not both go to work at the risk of neglecting their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of extreme difficulties both parents may have to work but the <span class="highlight">children</span> are usually well cared for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think the indictment of Australian parents by the Attorney-General that their <span class="highlight">children</span> are being neglected at present while they are out working is one which should be allowed to go unquestioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This scheme will provide for the less privileged <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been similar schemes, for example with regard to the Aged Persons Homes Acts and assistance to handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>, in which the Commonwealth has appropriated money for these purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think what I was intending to say - and whether or not my words actually conveyed the meaning must depend upon a reading of the Hansard record - was that parents often unwittingly place their <span class="highlight">children</span> in care that does not provide for their proper development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is nol to suggest that the parents are not concerned or interested in their <span class="highlight">children</span>, although I must say there are some - a minority, unquestionably - who do not meet their proper parental responsibilities to their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not to suggest that parents generaly are not striving to do the best they can for their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difficulty is that they feel they must work, for whatever reason, and they leave their <span class="highlight">children</span> in some place which they believe is appropriate and in fact it is not appropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been instances that have been tragic in some of their results where <span class="highlight">children</span> have been left locked at home throughout the day while the parents were out working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can only deplore the impact that that might have upon the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But i think that I would not generally disagree with the proposition that  Senator Cavanagh  put forward, that parents in this country do want to take care of their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They use their best endeavours to promote their <span class="highlight">children</span>’s welfare on a view which is fairly current right throughout the community, that parents want their <span class="highlight">children</span> to have a better life than they, the parents themselves, had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fundamental basis of this legislation is the acknowledgment of the fact that there are working mothers and there are parents other than working mothers who cannot look after their <span class="highlight">children</span> throughout the day and that there ought to be proper physical arrangements and professional staff to provide the type of child care in child care centres which will enable the welfare of these <span class="highlight">children</span> to be maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The training will be designed to maintain good standards of cleanliness and likewise meet the developmental, emotional and personal needs of all young <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The measures taken by the Government in assisting the community to overcome such problems do in fact provide a number of supports to the family such as the counselling service to be provided to parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> needing care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some places there is concern about whether the Government is not encouraging activity which will lead to <span class="highlight">children</span> being placed in centres while their mothers are engaged in activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There must be some such risk, but the real concern that the Government has is the welfare of the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the new Commonwealth compensation legislation the weekly payments will be $43 for a single employee, $54 for an employee with a wife, $59 for an employee with a wife and one child and $64 for an employee with a wife and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, in an inflationary period who is there in this chamber who would suggest that a fund of  $14,500,  especially for, say, a widow of  35  to  40  years of age without much prospect of remarriage and with perhaps four or five young <span class="highlight">children</span>, is any sort of an adequate cushion against adversity or any sort of a fund upon which to build a future life for herself and her <span class="highlight">children</span>, unpenalised by the death of the breadwinner? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our proposal is that a widow with <span class="highlight">children</span> relying upon her should continue to receive the same weekly payment while those <span class="highlight">children</span> are dependent upon her as she would have received from the breadwinner but for his accident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In July 1963, the late  Senator Wade,  then Minister for Health, announced special arrangements designed to assist <span class="highlight">children</span> born deformed as a result of their mothers’ taking the drug thalidomide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was intended to provide a ‘team’ approach to the provision of the most effective assistance to these <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 am assured by the Minister for Social Security that the existing Social Services Act provides that where for any reasons any <span class="highlight">children</span>, who would otherwise be living together as one family or as part of one family, are not living together the Director-General of Social Security may, if he thinks fit exercising his discretion, authorise payment of endowment in respect of any of those <span class="highlight">children</span>- at the rate that would be payable if those <span class="highlight">children</span> were in fact living together as one family, this rate being not less than the rate, that might otherwise be payable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Notwithstanding that the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts is charged with the responsibility to consider and report upon the best procedures to be adopted to assist the education of <span class="highlight">children</span> in isolated areas of Australia, has he or the Government received any complaints from the parents of such <span class="highlight">children</span> about the generous allocation of money to them prior to the report of the Senate Committee being finalised? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Labor Party, when it appropriates money for the <span class="highlight">children</span>, move that the only <span class="highlight">children</span> to receive any of the benefits are those whose parents are in the mothers clubs and the parents and citizens organisations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill proposed taking <span class="highlight">children</span> between the ages of 6 and 12 out of the mines, and the Conservatives there at that time were saying, ‘Look- ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the most objectionable aspects of the previous Government was the complete denial of any benefit at all for dependent full time student <span class="highlight">children</span> over 16 years of an unemployment or sickness beneficiary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Henceforth these student <span class="highlight">children</span> will attract full benefit rights irrespective of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the insignificant cost of this proposal $600,000 in a full year and $200,000 for the remainder of this year - the dogged persistence with which previous governments have clung to this practice of denying and depriving the dependent student <span class="highlight">children</span> of the needy unemployed is beyond any reasonable comprehension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have just mentioned, the standard rate will also apply to widow pensioners without <span class="highlight">children</span> in future which means that these women will receive increases of $4.25 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s policy on war pensions for student <span class="highlight">children</span>, which is reflected in the Bill, is that they should be continued until completion of full-time education in respect of dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> who are not receiving  a  maintenance or living allowance or salary from Commonwealth sources that equals  or  exceeds the allowances payable under the Repatriation Soldiers’ <span class="highlight">Children</span> Education Scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to <span class="highlight">children</span> of service pensioners, the Bill also reflects the Government’s policy that a child should continue  to  be recognised for service pension purposes irrespective  of  age, for as long as the child continues to undertake full-time education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thirdly,  Mr Deputy President,  at the present time some de facto wives and some exnuptial <span class="highlight">children</span> are recognised under repatriation legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill amends the principal Act to recognise for pension and other purposes the same classes of de facto wives and widows and ex-nuptial <span class="highlight">children</span> as recognised by the amendments to the Repatriation Act contained in the Repatriation Bill 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for the payment of war pension to student <span class="highlight">children</span> over the age of 21 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been stated in connection with the Repatriation Bill, the Government’s policy on student <span class="highlight">children</span> of war pensioners which is given effect to in this Bill in conjunction with the Repatriation Bill, is that they should not terminate at age 21 but be continued until completion of the student’s full-time education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This applies only in respect of dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> who are not receiving a maintenance or living allowance or salary from Commonwealth sources that equals or exceeds the allowances payable under a repatriation <span class="highlight">children</span> education scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has also been indicated in connection with the Repatriation Bill, whilst some de facto wives and some ex-nuptial <span class="highlight">children</span> are recognised for war pension purposes the Government considers the present provisions too restrictive and in need of being brought into line with the recognition now afforded such persons under other Commonwealth Acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In attempting to control the situation of making payments only to those in the community in need, I suggest that the Government should consider making grants to those churches and other institutions which have demonstrated an interest in assisting and making their services available to the unemployed, the aged, the homeless men and women, those in the community who have suffered a broken marriage or <span class="highlight">children</span> who have been left without parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all know that if <span class="highlight">children</span> are pandered to excessively weaknesses rather than strength of character may develop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed some wealthy employers led the fight to get <span class="highlight">children</span> out of the coal mines and spinning mills of Great Britain, but they were resisted greatly by many of the parents of the <span class="highlight">children</span>, who could not see how their families could survive without the incomes they had been used to receiving from the labours of the child members of their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to think that a balance could be achieved without legislation, but bearing in mind the history of television in this country to date and the paucity of programming in certain areas, such as <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs, professional variety programs and educational programs, if it cannot be done in co-operation with the stations it will have to be done by way of legislative enactment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the great things, one of the real improvements introduced by the Federal Act in 1959, was a provision that a decree for divorce should not be made absolute unless arrangements for the maintenance and custody of <span class="highlight">children</span> were approved by the Court and the Court was satisfied of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But if the Court is to be disembarrassed by being left in ignorance about custody and maintenance of the <span class="highlight">children</span>, it will be prevented from or handicapped in performing one of the supreme duties under the Act - that is, to be satisfield before dissolving the marriage that the arrangements as to the custody or maintenance of the <span class="highlight">children</span> are proper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 understand that difficulty is experienced in the courts in administering section 71 of the Act, under which the court must be satisfied either that proper arrangements have been made for the welfare of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the marriage or that special circumstances exist so that the decree nisi can be made absolute despite the court not being satisfied of such arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where the beneficiaries of such a small estate are a widow with or without dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> (although the hardships in the latter case are multiplied) the delays resulting from the existence of death duties can cause considerable hardship since the family assets - such as savings bank deposits - can generally not be touched while the only source of income has suddenly been removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind this Senate that statements have already been made that at least one of those 3 men who was executed - Vlasnovic, whose widow and <span class="highlight">children</span> live in Geelong, Victoria - never at any time had active association with Croat political activities in any organisation of violence, and did not go to Croatia under any circumstances of incursion but went for the innocent intent of visiting his parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be unfortunate for honourable senators opposite that in the 23 years in which they were in government they allowed a situation to develop wherein people had to move to the great metropolitan areas in order to get an income, and an education for their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Likewise the Bill provides that the oath or affirmation of allegiance shall be taken by all, except <span class="highlight">children</span> under 16, regardless of former nationality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think I should explain some of the conditions under which the Commonwealth senior secondary scholarship scheme and the isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>’s scheme operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where a holder of a senior secondary scholarship is also eligible for assistance under the Australian Government’s isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>’s scheme, his entitlement to senior secondary benefits is limited to the payment of the basic annual grant of $150. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, the same student may receive up to the maximum assistance of $1,004 per annum under the isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>’s scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can only end by saying that this is not because we think parents should never discourage their <span class="highlight">children</span>’s marriages but because this is not the way to do it; not because we think well of marriages made in defiance of parents but because we think the law now contributes to the defiance; not because the family is too weak to us: this weapon but because it is strong enough to do without it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second, and a deeply disturbing one, is that removing the requirement of parental consent would have the effect of undermining parental authority still further; and even of encouraging bad parents to wash their hands of their <span class="highlight">children</span> at the first signs of teenage trouble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, why should a parent, no matter how well meaning he or she may be and no matter how concerned he or she may be for the welfare of the <span class="highlight">children</span>, set himself or herself up as the judge of whether an appropriate marriage of young people, one of whom is over the age of 18, albeit under the age of 21, is going to be a successful marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is important is that people should be trained, should be educated and should have a feeling and an acceptance of the responsibilities which each is undertaking to the other and for their <span class="highlight">children</span> when they marry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The purpose is to remove as far as possible the distinction between <span class="highlight">children</span> born in wedlock and <span class="highlight">children</span> born out of wedlock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Point was made of the fact that the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate <span class="highlight">children</span> is removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But why do we persist with having this distinction between adopted <span class="highlight">children</span> and <span class="highlight">children</span> who are not adopted? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is to be a difficulty in definition of ‘parent’, surely that can be taken account of in the provisions of the legislation by way of definition/But I feel it is a curious change to remove the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate <span class="highlight">children</span> and still preserve the distinction between adopted and non-adopted <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he not give an indication that this is what he will arrange to be considered, namely, that the Department will try to avoid the distinction between adopted and non-adopted <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the Special Minister of State  (Senator Willesee)  rises to reply to the points raised by  Senator Greenwood  I want some explanation of the provision which is obliterating the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would doubt whether in a Bill such as this we have the constitutional right to alter the legitimacy of <span class="highlight">children</span> for the purpose of inheritance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise that query, but I want to know what the Bill is doing in relation to obliterating the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that one of the very purposes of the law in the legalisation of the relationship of marriage is to give legitimacy to the <span class="highlight">children</span> which, of course, gives them rights against the parents and the parents’ property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that we have to be careful to preserve the rights of <span class="highlight">children</span> against the indiscretions of parents, if I may put it in that form to open up the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The resources of the country are for our people and our <span class="highlight">children</span> in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be borne in mind that today a family, which includes a man, his wife and dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>, is covered by one annual payment of something like $110, which is reduced to $80 or $75 a year once it is claimed as a tax deduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The classes of women to whom the new benefit will be payable under this Bill are (a) unmarried mothers, including deserted de facto wives and de facto wives of prisoners’, (b) married women not living with their husbands (deserting wives) or wives who have been separated for various other reasons, provided that the women be living with, and have the custody, care and control of a child or <span class="highlight">children</span> of whom she is the mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These women are those who are not at present eligible for a widow’s pension under the Social Services Act and who, with their <span class="highlight">children</span>, have been subject to discrimination in the level of assistance available to them in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Returning now to the Bill, the rate of supporting mother’s benefit will be the same as the rate of Class A widow’s pensions, including mother’s allowance, additional pension for <span class="highlight">children</span> and, where applicable, supplementary assistance for those mothers who are paying rent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that in Tasmania a deserted de facto wife of 12 months standing may sue for maintenance for herself and <span class="highlight">children</span>, but in the other States she may claim maintenance for <span class="highlight">children</span> only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A word about <span class="highlight">children</span>: The Government believes that when a mother gives birth to a child she should not be discriminated against merely because conception may have occurred after she became a widow or after she became separated from her husband. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further advance made by the Bill is that the additional pension of $4.50 a week for <span class="highlight">children</span> will be payable for all other <span class="highlight">children</span> in the care, of the widow or supporting mother, whether those other <span class="highlight">children</span> are qualifying <span class="highlight">children</span> or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I previously mentioned, it will place all supporting mothers with <span class="highlight">children</span> in the same position as widows with <span class="highlight">children</span> and will remove the unjustifiable discrimination which has hitherto existed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its effect will perhaps be felt mainly by the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the women concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where the family includes more than two <span class="highlight">children</span>, this will be increased by $2 per week for each child after the second. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In line with our policy of ensuring that our housing advances for welfare purposes benefit the more needy, applicants eligible to receive home builders’ account advances will include a married or engaged couple and a single parent or guardian with one or more <span class="highlight">children</span>, where the average gross weekly income of the main breadwinner, inclusive of overtime but excluding child endowment payments, does not exceed  95  per cent of average weekly earnings, plus  $2  a week for each child beyond the second. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Prime Minister, prior to Christmas, instruct officials that social service payments to Aboriginals in outback areas should no longer be distributed partly in rations and the remainder in cash, but entirely in cash; if so, what effect has this decision had on the health of Aboriginals, particularly <span class="highlight">children</span>, in the outback areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have been gravely concerned for many years in trying to assist young people who, in the early stages of marriage with perhaps one or two <span class="highlight">children</span>, are forced to live with in-laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is so important not only to the parents and <span class="highlight">children</span> in a family but also to any government which may need to meet commitments arising from those problems which can develop out of bad family backgrounds and which can flow very often from the simple fact that people do not have the opportunity to own their own home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the other features of the new scheme are: Commutation of retirement pay will be a right for members who retired after 1 October 1972, subject only to applications for commutation being made within one year of retirement or such longer period as may be necessary in special circumstances; management of the scheme is to be vested in a statutory authority on which all the Services will be represented; reversionary benefits will be extended to de facto widows and the member’s illegitimate <span class="highlight">children</span> in certain circumstances, and dependent widowers of female members; the rates of pension payable in respect of <span class="highlight">children</span> and orphans will be increased and, provided they are receiving full time education at a school, college or university, will continue in payment until age 25 years; invalidity pay will no longer be subject to suspension solely on account of earnings from civil employment; a contributing or recipient member may, if he is dissatisfied with a decision of the authority in relation to invalidity classification or any other matter of general administration of the Act, have his case referred to an invalidity classification review tribunal or an administrative review tribunal, as appropriate, for hearing and decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It goes further, however, in that it incorporates certain beneficial provisions of the new scheme that relate to <span class="highlight">children</span> and invalidity pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, pensions payable in respect of <span class="highlight">children</span> and orphans are to be increased to the levels recommended by the Jess Committee and invalidity pen sioners, as well as having access to an invalidity classification review tribunal, will no longer be subject to the suspension provisions insofar as they relate to remuneration from civil employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is provision also for the payment of invalidity benefits, widow’s and <span class="highlight">children</span>’s pensions and for commutation to a lump sum of up to one-third of a member’s retirement pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remaining proposals in the Bill are a result of the introduction by the Commonwealth of schemes to assist with the education of <span class="highlight">children</span> living in isolated areas and for the payment of a domiciliary nursing care benefit to persons taking care of invalid aged relations in their homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments proposed in relation to the isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>’s education scheme will ensure that allowances paid under the scheme will receive the same exemption from income tax as payments under the Commonwealth secondary and technical scholarship schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like the scholarship schemes, however, amounts payable for the maintenance or accommodation of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> are to be taken into account for the purposes of the concessional deductions for maintenance of dependants while allowances paid in respect of education costs are to be taken into account in calculating the concessional deduction for a child’s education expenses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But I think it is pertinent to refer to a statement made by the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Grassby)  that the first priority -would be given to the reunion of immediate family members - husband, wife, parents and <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Government is considering the provision of extra assistance in order to develop technical train) ing facilities there is a case for a proposition that was put up many years ago to develop country centres in which Aboriginal and other Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> could be trained together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By way of preface I refer to the Minister’s own valuable role, when an Opposition senator, in the cause of Australian mothers whose <span class="highlight">children</span> were victims of the drug thalidomide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, we need accelerated action by Government in the provision of adequate child care facilities for those <span class="highlight">children</span> of working mothers who are part of the mainstream of our employment pattern at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have all sorts of statistics to show us how many more of these women are married and who have <span class="highlight">children</span> of pre-school age, yet it has been some years since the first Gorton proposal, that the Government would create child care facilities for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of working mothers was announced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that steps have been taken in this concept but I am a little concerned that they have not been taken as rapidly as the social pattern of Australia would show, because hundreds of thousands of pre-school <span class="highlight">children</span> of working mothers are at present without adequate or ideal child care facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Cotton  is in effect asking the Committee to differentiate between a person who has 3 weeks annual leave, who has a wife and <span class="highlight">children</span> and who has amenities in his home that he has to pay for, and another man who has 4 weeks annual leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendment which I shall present is one which sets out to provide that unmarried male and female contributors to the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund would have some entitlements to pass on in succession to a surviving mother, brother, sister or child, particularly if dependent, in the same way as can a married man in the Services in relation to his surviving widow and <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Also, we would be holding up various other provisions of the Bill with which we agree, such as ensuring that payments to parents of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> and payments of the domiciliary nursing allowance are not to be subject to tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They and their <span class="highlight">children</span> are able to live their lives in this country as a result of the work done by Arthur Calwell and of his vision of a continent peopled largely by migrants from Europe who would bring the talents, enthusiasm and vigour of new people to join the British who were largely occupying this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What the Labor Party should remember is that it is not schools with which we are concerned, it is <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He moved that at the end of the motion the following words be added:   but the Senate, while not refusing a second  reading  to the Bill, is of the opinion that it should provide for the establishment of an Australian Schools Commission to examine and determine the needs of students in government and non-government primary, secondary and technical schools, and recommend grants which the Commonwealth should make to the States to assist in meeting the requirements of all school age <span class="highlight">children</span> on the basis of needs and priorities and that the application of this policy could not allow the continued acceptance of the provisions of the Bill and that therefore grants should not be made on the basis provided in the Bill in respect of any year after 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It did it purely for the purpose of attempting to implement some socialist ideology which shows it has a hate against those schools to which parents send their <span class="highlight">children</span> in order to give them some greater educational benefit than they otherwise would have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My <span class="highlight">children</span> go to private schools at which I think they obtain an excellent education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If one says nothing else, 1 think one must say that one has to admire the audacity of a defunct, defeated Liberal Party which, on seeing the first Labor Budget for 23 years which gives unprecedented assistance to the education of Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>, with an increase- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we do not give money to education we are depriving the <span class="highlight">children</span> of their education, and if we do give money that is inflationary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At a time when such a tremendous increase in expenditure on education is proposed by the Federal Labor Government the Liberal Party can only say that we are denying the rights of Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> to an education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Government holusbolus gave per capita grants to schools, taking no account whatsoever of the financial resources of the parents whose <span class="highlight">children</span> were receiving that assistance and taking no account whatsoever to the financial resources of the schools receiving that assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In its first report relating to the distribution of the additional S2S0.000 per annum to those independent schools which have <span class="highlight">children</span> attending primary schools, the Committee said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  <li>
    <p>They increased in government schools and so too did the grants increase to <span class="highlight">children</span> attending non-government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But they have taken grants away from 19 per cent of <span class="highlight">children</span> at non-systemic non-government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want to make a further point, lt was bad enough that that committee should work out a system such as it worked out for categorising schools, but it is worse that the Government acted a fortnight after the report came out and before a majority of the organisations of parents of school <span class="highlight">children</span>, the people interested in education in Australia, had even been able to receive a copy of the report which carne out in such limited numbers that it was available to members of Parliament, a few committees and about half a dozen schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It cut out aid to little schools such as the ones I referred to last night that cannot afford to be toyed with at the whim of some socialist who decides that he wants vindictively to take it out because of some idea that wealthy schools should be discriminated against without ever thinking that at whatever school it may be there are <span class="highlight">children</span> who may come from a variety of economic backgrounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that many public and private companies are purchasing homes for executives and allowing capital outlay, rates and taxes as charges against general costs to the company; extensively using expense accounts as entertainment charges to the company; allowing executives to charge education of their <span class="highlight">children</span> at wealthy private schools as a cost to the company; allowing interstate and international trips by company officials as expenditure items to the company’s costs; and generally loading a large amount of nonbusiness activity as a cost to their enterprise? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However hard such an attitude may seem in a particular case - an honourable senator in such a case would want to pay any price if his own <span class="highlight">children</span> or members of his own family were involved - nevertheless in the general public interest, as with cases of kidnapping, the law ought to be as strong as it can be that no one should be permitted to pay any ransom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What  Senator Greenwood  is putting to the Committee is that if there is a Lieutenant Calley in our community subject to our laws, we will not have him living in honour, or in immunity or at all because the community that  Senator Greenwood’s  proposal expresses is nobler than that which gives continuance to the life of a person who has shot women and <span class="highlight">children</span> and nobbled men in massacre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If these examinations indicate that the other <span class="highlight">children</span> who are not now the subject of the offer by Distillers Ltd are the victims of thalidomide, I understand that  Dr Everingham  will be pressing Distillers Ltd to make a further offer of compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was the responsibility of the State or of some relative to keep such <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On many occasions such <span class="highlight">children</span> were neglected and were the responsibility of organisations which exist for such purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are essential at this stage for the participation which is already involved and the numbers of pre-school age <span class="highlight">children</span> and young school age <span class="highlight">children</span> whose mothers are working mothers and who need the assistance of child care centres to combine their domestic and family reponsibilities with that of their employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important to the Australian community that the development of child care centres be a program which protects the strength of the family and gives the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the working mother an opportunity to develop at all stages of their emotional and educational needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope there will be some acceleration of the proposals in this regard and that a child care centres program will be developed to enable the expec- tationwhich the Treasurer has mentioned of a growthinthe number of women in the workforce tocomeabout and also to enable those women whoareatpresent occupied outside of the home tohavetheir <span class="highlight">children</span> cared for during their workinghours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to a statement made yesterday by the Tasmanian Minister for Agriculture claiming that the Commonwealth Government’s decision to abandon free milk distribution to school <span class="highlight">children</span> will cost the Tasmanian economy $550,000 per annum and will particularly damage the residents of the west coast area in relation both to cost and availability of milk? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Additional payments for <span class="highlight">children</span> of pensioners and supporting mothers are to be increased by 50c per week to $5 per week for each child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A small pension of 25c a week presently payable to certain <span class="highlight">children</span> of service pensioners, but not payable to <span class="highlight">children</span> of social service pensioners, will be discontinued, but this will be more than offset by the increase in the rates payable to parents in respect of those <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Increases are proposed in the payments made to the widows of those ex-servicemen who died from war-related causes, and to the <span class="highlight">children</span> and certain other dependants of those servicemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pensions payable to the <span class="highlight">children</span> of deceased ex-servicemen will also be increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Approximately 3,200 <span class="highlight">children</span> are involved, of which about 130 fall into the latter category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another relatively small group of dependants are the widowed mothers of deceased unmarried exservicemen and the fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters and invalid <span class="highlight">children</span> of deceased exservicemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The domestic allowance, which is payable to approximately 97 per cent of war widows, either because they have <span class="highlight">children</span>, including student <span class="highlight">children</span>, or because they are at least 50 years of age or are permanently unemployable, will be increased by $ 1 to $9.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Soldiers’ <span class="highlight">children</span> education scheme allowances for other than tertiary students will be increased by various amounts ranging from 65c to $3.35 and the new weekly rates will range from $3.25 to $16.65. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present Government has introduced this program because it is well aware of the fact that <span class="highlight">children</span> in very densely populated suburbs are at a distinct disadvantage compared with those attending privileged independent schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make no reflections on school teachers because I am fully aware of the fact that with increased enrolments, and particularly with an influx of migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> who have very little knowledge of English, the problem facing school teachers has become a lot harder every year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some teenage students at a Victorian technical college have the reading ability of seven-year-old <span class="highlight">children</span>, and two read so poorly that they are technically unable to read at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another 7 1 could read only as well as <span class="highlight">children</span> aged 10 to 12, and the rest could not read as well as most nine-year-olds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is to spend over $400 m more than was spent by the previous Government last year in order to try to overcome this problem where the education of school <span class="highlight">children</span> is declining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An article in the ‘National Times’ of 17 September 1973- only yesterday- under the heading ‘Poor <span class="highlight">children</span> get a poorer education, Western Australian survey shows’ states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A massive effort will be needed to correct grave educational injustices in Australian schools, judging from a survey recently completed among West Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The survey, carried out by the State Teachers’ Union, found that <span class="highlight">children</span> from poor suburbs were severely handicapped in learning skills, compared with those in wealthier areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In one school in an industrial suburb of Perth, 80 per cent of the <span class="highlight">children</span> were more than a year behind in reading ability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that school, among 80 Grade 7 <span class="highlight">children</span> (who would be moving on to high school the following year) only nine had average reading ability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among another group of <span class="highlight">children</span> in the same grade, but in a suburb of more fortunate parents, only 7 per cent suffered reading retardation of a year or more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But even in more prosperous suburbs like this, the survey found there was a need for an extra teacher in each school to help <span class="highlight">children</span> who were behind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I venture to say that most States will be happy to see that at last a sympathetic Labor Government is increasing payments so that <span class="highlight">children</span> in our schools can and will receive equal education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another example is the case of an aged couple who were looking after 2 grandchildren whose parents had died in a motor accident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were not receiving any allowance for the 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until I made inquiries on her behalf, she did not receive any allowance for looking after the 2 grandchildren. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A <span class="highlight">children</span>’s opera was commissioned by the ABC’s Young Peoples Department and the light entertainment programs had an immediate injection of more Australian material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet every time Government supporters talk to their own doctors in country areas they say that they should be paid the same rate as the specialist because they are delivering <span class="highlight">children</span> or are removing tonsils just as a specialist does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me put it this way: When I was a Minister in Tasmania I raised this same question with Cabinet- there were nine of us- because I knew that eight of them, or their wives or <span class="highlight">children</span>, had been in a private hospital rather than a public hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All right, it was their wives or their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the outbreak of scabies and gastro-enteritis on Palm Island and medical disclosures that up to three-quarters of the <span class="highlight">children</span> there are suffering from those complaints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But two or three members of the one family who are on the dole are better off than a family of five or six <span class="highlight">children</span> whose father is working 40 hours a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government has done exactly that to petrol, liquor, cigarettes, and the ordinary soft drinks of the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to yesterday’s announcement by the Premier of Tasmania that his Cabinet has decided to change its previously announced policy of providing grants to non-government schools on a so-called needs basis and has decided to accept the principle of the entitlement of all <span class="highlight">children</span> attending nongovernment schools to a basic per capita grant? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he ask his colleague, the Minister for Education, to have the Commonwealth Government follow the lead given by its fellow Labor Government in Tasmania and reconsider this Government’s decision to discriminate vindictively against some Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> by cutting off grants previously provided? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government restore per capita grants together with extra assistance to disadvantaged <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I appreciate the contribution these documents make to educating school <span class="highlight">children</span> and society towards a better understanding of Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And now that these people have an opportunity to stabilise their properties and their assets and to do something worth while for the future and for their <span class="highlight">children</span>, they find that this Government has no interest whatsoever in the rural areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Does the AttorneyGeneral recall a question I asked last week concerning the removal from the Commonwealth law of any references to the illegitimacy of <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nola is one of many Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> who. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be easy to claim that the custody of Nola is a civil matter but as the Australian Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  Mr Bryant  accepted the responsibility of putting right the wrongs of history and ensuring by a vigorous policy of developing educational, medical and similar services in remote Aboriginal communities that the practice of separating mothers from their <span class="highlight">children</span> ceases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever we think about the Soviet Union and whatever we think about the United States, there is no doubt that the relationships between those 2 great powers will have a great deal to do with the sort of lives that we and our <span class="highlight">children</span> will live in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill provides legislative basis for the provision, as an emergency measure under the child migrant education program, of supplementary class-room accommodation in state and independent schools where this is necessary to allow adequate special instruction of migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> to take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The program of special assistance to state and independent schools in which there are migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> handicapped by a lack of knowledge of the English language was introduced by the previous Government in April 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The decision was then taken that funds should be provided for the salaries of special teachers to provide special instruction to migrant <span class="highlight">children</span>; for the purchase of approved capital equipment of the language laboratory type for use in the special classes to be established; for the provision of suitable teaching and learning materials; and for the cost of training courses for special teachers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We expect that close on 60,000 <span class="highlight">children</span> will be receiving instruction in special classes this financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report showed that only one-third of <span class="highlight">children</span> in the 63 schools surveyed who were having difficulty with English were actually receiving assistance and of this one-third 40 per cent were not receiving sufficient special tuition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In effect, only 20 per cent of the <span class="highlight">children</span> in the schools surveyed who need English were receiving enough of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report of the New South Wales task force, released by  Mr Riordan,  M.P., in the absence of the  Chairman, Dr Klugman,  M.P., called attention to the urgent need to extend to the fullest possible extent the present system of teaching migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> English as quickly as possible after enrolment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In presenting the report of the Victoria task force, its  Chairman, Mr Garrick,  M.P., and Vice-Chairman,  Mr Innes,  M.P., reported that migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> are being blatantly denied a good education because they are not taught enough English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following the Government’s decision, state and independent school authorities were asked to establish priorities on the basis of the greatest need- in terms of high migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> density and the location of schools in areas of social deprivation, which tend together to compound the problems of both migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> and special teachers, the availability of special teachers, and ground space at the schools where demountable class-rooms could be erected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the problems which was identified as a result of a number of inquiries set up by the Opposition while in government was the need for a greater degree of English teaching of migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> to enable them to participate fully in the education otherwise available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Part of the fair go given is that the <span class="highlight">children</span> should be given special coaching where necessary in the English language to enable them to be able to participate fully in and obtain the rewards from the education system available in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When a government has shown that it is making provision for pensions, that it is helping school <span class="highlight">children</span> by providing massive amounts for the education of our young people and is providing massive amounts for hospitals, it is not right then to say to that government: ‘If you are taking the steps which you consider are important to balance the finances at a time like this, we will say you are to be criticised because this in some way has an adverse effect on some people in the lower income groups.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the introduction of the recommendations of the Interim Committee for the Australian Schools Commission, relating to the education and training of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>, it is probable that there will be a reduction in the assistance sought by voluntary and religious organisations under the Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span> (Assistance) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the first things that the Australian Labor Party did when it gained office and before there were any pressures at all from any organisations was to give to the parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> in isolated areas an amount of $1,004 a year towards the education of those <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The initiatives we have taken during the last 12 months have broadened and developed the Commonwealth’s involvement in the education of your <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They had seen what pre-school facilities were given to <span class="highlight">children</span> overseas, and had then come back and had never done a thing about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Who fought the teachers of this country when they sought a better way of life and a better standard of pay for the way in which they had to teach the <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will give an education allowance of $400 a year free of means test for <span class="highlight">children</span> in isolated areas who must live away from home in order to attend school or who have to be taught at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It rejected the idea of finding out what is required by the people of Australia so that the school <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australia might be better educated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have told honourable senators what we have done to assist the parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> in isolated areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government rejects them, it rejects its election policies and the representations by the various teacher bodies, parent bodies and special handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The radiation dose to thyroid, however, has varied year-by-year up to total levels of IS millirads in a year for young <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That same Bill provided for additional payments for <span class="highlight">children</span> of pensioners to be increased by 50c per week to $S per week for each child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-17">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It applies to aged persons’ homes, the provision of delivered meals, sheltered employment and assistance to handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The 2 Bills are the Sheltered Employment (Assistance) Bill 1973 and the Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span> (Assistance) Bill 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The additional assistance provided this year will cost the Government $200,000 under the Sheltered Employment (Assistance) Bill and $100,000 under the Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span> (Assistance) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great deal needs to be said about that Bill, but I wish to concentrate my remarks on the Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span> (Assistance) Bill because we all have a heartfelt desire to assist those handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill extends the provisions so that this money can be used towards meeting the capital cost of training centres, training equipment and residential units for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian community can be reasonably proud of its past record in providing assistance to certain areas of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, we find that today mentally handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> fall into the category which receives assistance from the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great deal needs to be done, particularly for the mentally handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are finding that in many areas of large cities <span class="highlight">children</span> are becoming socially deprived not because of the income that is coming into the family but because of the fact that parents are becoming particularly busy in their own workaday world and <span class="highlight">children</span> are being left to fend very much for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps we will have to find some way to turn the wheel back so that the main responsibility of the mother is to mother and look after her <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, early in the day and late in the afternoon the <span class="highlight">children</span> must fend for themselves or else be brought up by the other <span class="highlight">children</span> in the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1954 I have been connected with the board of management of the Victorian School for Deaf <span class="highlight">Children</span>, which is the largest school for deaf <span class="highlight">children</span> in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, since 1945 free hearing aids have been available to <span class="highlight">children</span> who lost their hearing either at birth or were found to be deaf in their early school life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is providing the very basis for improving the conditions in the institutions and assisting those in the community who can be referred to as handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span> (Assistance) Bill provides an expenditure of only $100,000 and the Sheltered Employment (Assistance) Bill provides an expenditure of approximately $200,000, but the contributions will be of enormous importance to those in the community who are covered by the provisions of the Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How often on a Saturday or a Sunday do we say to the wife and <span class="highlight">children</span>: ‘Let’s pack a picnic basket and go down to the coast’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to refer to the Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span> (Assistance) Bill 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am pleased to see that this Bill provides for the extension of finance to local government authorities in Australia to enable them to provide training centres, training equipment and residential units for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">children</span> in the community will benefit from this piece of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one considers that in Australia today many <span class="highlight">children</span> are being held back because of problems associated with, for example, dyslexia, multiple sclerosis and other disabilities that affect their mental processes- deafness, poor vision and so on- one can identify many thousands of <span class="highlight">children</span> in our communities who require further assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation will mean that we shall need more social workers, occupational therapists and other people involved with ancillary professions working in this important area for the benefit of the less fortunate <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, I believe, is an urgent need and must be carried out quickly to ensure that the money which we will provide to local government will be used in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">children</span> to whom I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee reported that 44,000 handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> had been identified in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite sure that if we made an intensive examination of this problem we would find that there are nearer 50,000 handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>, and possibly more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having been a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and Welfare which inquired at length into the problems of the physically and mentally handicapped, I echo the remarks of  Senator Jessop  when I say frankly that I am very proud that the Government of which I am a member has taken heed of the very detailed and voluminous report which was arrived at collectively and unanimously by the members of that Committee, who were of all political persuasions, after they had taken evidence at length from a large cross-section of the Australian people who represent the physically and mentally handicapped section, particularly the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>, in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the report of the Committee was presented to the Parliament, I, as a member of the then Opposition, recalled in detail the heartrending examples that we saw at first hand of the problems of many <span class="highlight">children</span> and their parents and, probably to a greater extent, the problems of the non-handicapped members of families which have mentally or physically handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We intend to introduce further legislation for isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>, Aboriginal students and students receiving benefits under the Government’s new secondary allowances schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Six other members upon the recommendations of the Australian Education Council and of whom two shall be members of parent organisations selected by the Australian Education Council from a panel of not less than five persons’ names submitted by the Australian Council of State School Organisations and one shall be a person involved in special education of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> or <span class="highlight">children</span> with special learning difficulties; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment recognises that instead of 1 parent, 2 parents shall be selected and, it goes further to include the representation of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the absorption of education between certain ages- 6 years and 1 5 years in most States- and attendance at school by <span class="highlight">children</span> irrespective of living standards, affluence or poverty of parents are made compulsory, the Liberal Party sees the responsibility of government as being to provide within a state system a secular system of education which is free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it is fundamental to the second part of a philosophy on education that we understand and embody the third section of that Declaration; that is, that parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are, I hope, combined in the view that that education should be extended to all <span class="highlight">children</span>, not to only some. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has pointed out that more than 70 per cent of school age <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia attend state schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our policy proposal which was put to the people was to appoint an expert advisory committee at the national level which would determine standards, the needs of students in both government and non-government schools and which would recommend grants on the basis of priority of need bearing in mind particularly the primary obligation of governments to provide and maintain the government schools system at the highest standard to all Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proof of the Government’s concern for the education of Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> in all schools, both government and non-government, is demonstrated by its actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In respect of the Department of Education the increase is for Aboriginal secondary grants, Aboriginal study grants and isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>’s assistance, the latter being for the substantial amount of $ 1.5m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are told that thousands of cheering men, women and <span class="highlight">children</span> lined the streets of Peking, presumably shouting Vive l’Emperor’ or ‘Vive Whitlame’, or whatever way one says it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister study the contents of advice given by  Mr Geoffrey  Loftus Hills, who is a former head of the dairy research division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and who yesterday hit out in a very rugged fashion at the Australian Government’s decision to discontinue the supply of free milk to school <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister note that this gentleman says that school milk is essential to ensure good nutrition for the young and points out that because the of increase in the number of mothers going to work and the growing tendency to let <span class="highlight">children</span> eat whatever they like, <span class="highlight">children</span> need milk as a supplement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That journal states that the decision to withdraw free school milk is an outrageous sacrifice of straightforward fact and, more importantly, <span class="highlight">children</span>’s health and looks like a simple but vicious principle of penny pinching. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I plead with the Government to see a reason for reintroducing free milk for school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter of free milk for school <span class="highlight">children</span> was given deep consideration by the Cabinet following the presentation of the Coombs task force report which questioned the advisability of this practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, people disagree about the value of milk for school <span class="highlight">children</span>, and there were reports which questioned strongly whether the milk was being drunk by the school <span class="highlight">children</span>, particularly those who needed it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was decided to continue the provision of this milk in areas where it was thought that the need existed because of underprivileged or undernourished <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is not a matter of putting up a case that milk is of benefit to the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is thought that in today’s affluent society <span class="highlight">children</span> follow suitable dietary habits at home and that therefore it is not necessary to supply milk to school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even now we notice in the gallery a number of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it right that these people in hotes and motels should be slugged at a much greater rate than the ordinary resident and that this charge should be passed on to <span class="highlight">children</span> such as those in the gallery and tourists generally? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps I should have given prioity to Parliament House itself, which is becoming a Mecca for nearly all Australian people and particularly for <span class="highlight">children</span> who feel that it is part of their education to come to Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, I am sure that the metric system will beneficial for our <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It concerns the matter of free milk for school <span class="highlight">children</span> which, the Minister will remember, I raised by way of questions on other occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, is the Minister aware that in many areas <span class="highlight">children</span> are subsisting on a less than adequate diet, that the removal of the free milk scheme next year will be to the further detriment of their diet, and that the statement that there is no longer any justification for this scheme on a nutritional basis is incorrect and cannot be justified? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a primary obligation to provide government school systems of the highest standards open to all <span class="highlight">children</span> without fees or religious tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In addition, university people have been able to discuss their ideas on education as have various other experts from a wide cross section of educational fields in relation to primary and secondary school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that there are areas where it is necessary to take steps to overcome disadvantages and to bring up the standards available to the <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Then, we would suggest that upon a pro rata basis of the number of <span class="highlight">children</span> who are involved in government schools and the number of <span class="highlight">children</span> involved in non-government schools, the representation of the non-government school area would be appropriately a 20 per cent basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of <span class="highlight">children</span> involved in this area of education represents slightly more than 20 per cent of the total number. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the closest percentage one can obtain on the basis of 3 out of 15 <span class="highlight">children</span> is 20 per cent as the appropriate representation of the non-government school area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the people who are appointed by that organisation- in language which I think is a fair interpretation of what  Senator James  McClelland has put- be completely narrow and prejudiced in their approach to the problem of the education of all Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Council should also, in the forum in which it has total discretion, appoint one person who is involved in the special education of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> or <span class="highlight">children</span> with special learning difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Council is in fact comprised of a large crosssection of parents who have <span class="highlight">children</span> attending Catholic and non-Catholic schools, it is made up primarily of Catholic parents because most of the <span class="highlight">children</span> who attend non-government schools go to Catholic schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe it is desirable that the group represented by its Secretary,  Mrs Ryan,  which has been referred to on a number of occasions, should be represented on the Commission, together with the parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> attending government schools in Australia, with the right to have their say in the development of education in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It represented, I was told, the teachers organisation from each State and also the parents of state school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The representatives of the parents of state school <span class="highlight">children</span> said: ‘It would do us if we could nominate our representatives’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was informed by the teachers’ representative and by a prominent representative of parents of state school <span class="highlight">children</span> that they would like to appoint their representatives but that they had been told from some source that if they did so they would not get the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This percentage agrees with the percentage of the number of <span class="highlight">children</span> in independent schools compared with the total number of school <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Say, for instance, that the Australian Council of State School Organisations nominates a person who has qualifications in special education of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> as its nominee for a position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But in Tasmania there is a very well qualified person who has special education qualifications in respect of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> and <span class="highlight">children</span> with special learning difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It may, in its honest belief, say that person A is the best man for this job because he is highly qualified in special education of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government may know of somebody in some other State who is qualified in both those fields of special education- handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> and <span class="highlight">children</span> with special learning difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a well known statistical fact that 20 per cent of all primary school <span class="highlight">children</span> have some specific learning defect, whether it is an inability to leant to read or an inability to do sums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But he misread our amendment which provides in paragraph (b) that the Australian Education Council should select 6 members, of whom 2 shall be from the parent group and 1 shall be a person involved in the special education of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this to be effectively and practically achieved, it is imperative that representation on the Commission comes from parent teacher organisations, which have to deal with problems at classroom level- and therefore have first hand knowledge of them, and the effect they have on our <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the primary obligation, in relation to education, for governments to provide and maintain government school systems that are of the highest standard and are open, without fees or religious tests, to all <span class="highlight">children</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We simply take that up to say that it is important that there should be the maximum of consultation and co-operation, because if the Commonwealth is to do a successful job in relation to the improvement of the standards of education in Australia obviously it will need consultation and co-operation with those who actually do the work, that is, the State or the non-government schools, in relation to all school <span class="highlight">children</span> other than those in the Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the reason that the overwhelming majority of Australians regard it as an act of justice to assist Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>, whatever school they may go to, I think that this amendment is more comprehensive and clearer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The primary obligation, in relation to education, for governments to provide and maintain government school systems that are of the highest standard and are open, without fees or religious tests, to all <span class="highlight">children</span>- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Article 26 of the United Nations Chaner of Human Rights and in particular the prior right of parents to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their <span class="highlight">children</span>; (aa) the obligation for governments to provide or assist in the provision and maintenance of educational opportunities for all <span class="highlight">children</span> which are of the highest standard and which recognise the prior right of parents to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their <span class="highlight">children</span> and where provided and maintained by or on behalf of a government ensure that these opportunities are open without fees or religious tests, to all <span class="highlight">children</span>; (ab) the rights and powers pursuant to the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act of the State Governments in relation to education; (ac) the need for research into education standards, quality, variety and opportunities in Australia; (ad) the importance of the improvement of the quality of education available to all students attending primary and secondary schools; ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first of those proposes that the Commission shall have regard to Article 26 of the United Nations Charter of Human Rights and, in particular, the prior right of parents to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, I point out that the Declaration of Human Rights in this respect embodies a principle which I think has been accepted as an important principle, namely to avoid the possibility that there could develop in a country- one hopes that it should never be a fear in Australia- political indoctrination and the opportunity for the political education of <span class="highlight">children</span>, where steps are taken which would mean that <span class="highlight">children</span> were not obtaining the type of education which they or their parents might wish them to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While recognising the democratic right of people to educate their <span class="highlight">children</span> in any system we believe that non-government schools should not be established or maintained by the use of public funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is quite clear that those 3 powerful groups in New South Wales would all support the right to have included in the consideration of education in Australia that parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that should be given to their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we would suggest that it is an improvement to state it in the following way:  the obligation for governments to provide or assist in the provision and maintenance of educational opportunities for all <span class="highlight">children</span> which are of the highest standard and which recognise the prior right of parents to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their <span class="highlight">children</span> and where provided and maintained by or on behalf of a government ensure that these opportunities are open without fees or religious tests to all <span class="highlight">children</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is our very firm belief as an Opposition that the obligation of governments which, amongst other things, require all <span class="highlight">children</span> with a very limited number of special exceptions to undergo education, is an obligation of that government to ensure that educational facilities of the highest standards are available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a matter of the government’s ensuring that all <span class="highlight">children</span> attend government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been told by the Government that its outlook is one of seeking to improve the general quality of education throughout the community but in the Government’s Bill we find that the <span class="highlight">children</span> of this country are to be divided into 2 classes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government says that the primary obligation in relation to education is to provide and maintain government school systems that are of the highest standard and are open without fees or religious test to all <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have never been able to recognise any distinction between the <span class="highlight">children</span> of this country on the basis of what school they attend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I disagree with the Government’s statement that there is a primary obligation to one section of our <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My attitude is that there is an obligation to all of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason I prefer what  Senator Rae  supports which is, in effect, that we regard all the <span class="highlight">children</span> of this country as having equal rights and we give each of them justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some members of the Labor Party have assured me that they believe in equal justice for all our <span class="highlight">children</span> and that the only difference is, perhaps, in the ways in which the justice shall be dispensed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Labor Party is going back to 1957- in the days when it did not agree with justice for independent schools- when it states in this clause, in effect, that it will divide the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The gallup polls show that the people believe that all the <span class="highlight">children</span> should be given an equal chance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are the people who have tried to divide the <span class="highlight">children</span> of this country into those who go to one type of school and those who attend another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the Labor Party has made a grave mistake in once again putting forward this proposition that some <span class="highlight">children</span> in the community have prior rights to others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I defy anyone here to say that the incomes received by the parents of pupils who went to Riverview College, Barker College or Sydney Grammar School in the 1 930s were not far in excess of the incomes received by the gas workers and railway men who provided money for the Burwood and Ashfield Catholic schools which their <span class="highlight">children</span> attended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not scorn anybody, no matter what his religious beliefs may be, for being able to send his <span class="highlight">children</span> to those schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It sometimes happens that the incomes of the fathers of <span class="highlight">children</span> who attend wealthy independent schools become such that they have to go to other schools which do not have the same amenities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If anybody went along with me to the All Hallows Convent at Haberfield in the Evans electorate he would find not only that that school is attended by <span class="highlight">children</span> from low income families but also that the problem is compounded by migrant <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government will establish an Australian Schools Commission to examine and determine the needs of students in government and non-government primary, secondary and technical schools and recommend grants which the Australian Government should make to the States to assist in meeting the requirements of all school-age <span class="highlight">children</span> on the basis of needs and priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This debate has been conducted on a very high plane and I am sure that  Senator McManus  will agree that in the Bill which the Government has presented to the Parliament for endorsement the Government has set out deliberately by proposing the establishment of a Schools Commission to provide for equality of opportunity in education for all <span class="highlight">children</span> irrespective of school or religious denomination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is, of course, a plank of the Labor Party policy that there is a primary obligation on governments to provide and maintain government school systems of the highest standards open to all <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not deny that there should be an opportunity, as there is, for parents to nominate the school to which their child will go but surely no one can object to the basic cardinal principle that there is an obligation to ensure that an educational system is maintained at the highest level in schools of the highest standard, open without fee and without religious test to all <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that the primary obligation upon the Government should be to provide adequate education for all <span class="highlight">children</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is certainly nothing sectarian in the suggestion that we treat the <span class="highlight">children</span> as a whole and not divide them into 2 sections according to the school which they attend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sub-clause ( 1 ) refers to the question of financial assistance to the States in respect of schools and school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of them said that he and his <span class="highlight">children</span> were taken to the police station at about 4 a.m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  <span class="highlight">children</span> were held in the police station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is one of the freedom fighters; one of the people who cross the borders of Rhodesia and murder black women and <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not doubt for one minute that when it comes to doing a few sums at school the <span class="highlight">children</span> will find that the metric system is much easier than the present one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I do think that in this society certainly not enough attention is being given to the position of young families or of young <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Senate on a number of occasions and in particular areas has expressed its concern, particularly in the educational field, in the sense that Committees have had referred to them the matters of education of <span class="highlight">children</span> in isolated areas, the education of deprived <span class="highlight">children</span> and, at the instance of  Senator Fitzgerald,  the education of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This shows a general solicitude for the educational care of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is a wider care of <span class="highlight">children</span> which also must receive parliamentary and national attention and which should reflect parliamentary and national concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the economic and social position of young families whose income is inadequate and whose <span class="highlight">children</span> may, as the end result, suffer deprivation and denial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is obviously one of the ways in which the needs of young families, and particularly the needs of young <span class="highlight">children</span>, can at least be provided for in part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We virtually have not succeeded at all in our campaign- certainly in no large measure- in persuading either the previous government or this Government of the need for an adequate provision for child endowment in the case of families which have more than a certain number of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It says with quite a degree of balance that one cannot give an undue accent to the disregard of the position of the aged any more than one can give an undue accent to the disregard of the position of the younger families and <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last thing I wish to say is that noting that under section 8 the benefit of the scholarship may be a basic allowance or a living allowance, I applaud what the Government has done regarding living allowances for isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I only hope that because of the disadvantage which the child of school or university age is suffering by reason of the high cost of transport and living in the cities and the high cost of educational fees and other things in the cities, emphasis will be given on a basis proportionate to the hardship of those costs upon country <span class="highlight">children</span> in providing the living allowances so that the injustice that is imposed upon <span class="highlight">children</span>- a barrier to country <span class="highlight">children</span> against their getting an equal opportunity with those living in the cities- can be bridged as much as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a person who has <span class="highlight">children</span> who, as students, are affected by legislation of this nature, I can appreciate some concern on the part of the Opposition about this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not wish to comment on the matters that were raised by  Senator McManus,  except to say that, having had one of my own <span class="highlight">children</span> go through university, having another at university and having another about to go to university, I think that this country has every reason to be proud of the standard of its youth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that this should be extended and that greater opportunity should be given to the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the working class of this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my time if a teacher sent <span class="highlight">children</span> for examinations and 30 per cent of them failed, the next year the inspector would want to know why. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that what  Senator McManus  has put is really related only to the simple fact that a person wants to send his or her child to a university merely because  Mrs Jones  or  Mrs Smith  down the road is sending her <span class="highlight">children</span> to a university. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But $2 5 m is an enormous amount to the wives and <span class="highlight">children</span> of the growers of this country, faced already as they are with the hardships imposed upon them by revaluation of the dollar and with the extra competition from the countries whose fruit can now be admitted more cheaply to the Euopean market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australians and I add my tribute to him and express my sincere sympathy to  Mrs Dedman  and their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some elements of taxable pensions, such as allowances for the payment of rent or for the support of <span class="highlight">children</span>, will remain exempt and, in the latter case, concessional deductions will also be allowed in assessments for the maintenance of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government accepted the Commission’s recommendations in entirety including the recommendations for special grants for the particularly worthy purposes of accelerating the development of teachers college libraries, of fostering research into aspects of teacher education, of increasing the numbers of students undertaking courses to prepare teachers for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>, and, of extending teacher education facilities in existing colleges of advanced education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, consequent upon the Commission’s Report on Teacher Education and the Report of the Interim Committee for the Australian Schools Commission the Minister for Education has written to the  Chairman  of the Australian Commission on Advanced Education and the Australian Universities Commission asking them to report on the grants that should be made to ensure that adequate provision is made for the training of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know that I have ever heard of a government more bankrupt of principle than a government which says that if people try to get its leaders to keep a promise, it will deprive the <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australia of $600m in educational aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great proportion of the $8,448 paid in tax by a taxpayer on this high income would be spent on the education of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has it been left to each school to take the initiative in finding this out; if this is so, is it not an irresponsible policy since the school, on behalf of the Government, acts as the trustee for per capita grants to parents and their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The education of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> was characterised by omissions to meet need which bordered upon the callous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some States had no schemes for the assistance of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> worthy of the name of assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A scheme existed through the Australian Department of Social Security to assist the education of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> by private charities, but not in State schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Knowledge of the medical, psychological and physical characteristics of young <span class="highlight">children</span>, and their home environments, was a closed book to the first teachers enrolling them at school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Disadvantaged <span class="highlight">children</span> and handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> suffered greatly in this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>is below that required to implement modern educational methods, and to prepare all <span class="highlight">children</span>, irrespective of their rate and style of learning, for full participation in a complex society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In both government and non-government sectors there are schools where the quality of personnel, buildings and equipment reflects an attitude towards <span class="highlight">children</span> which, whether it arises from public indifference or ignorance, is incompatible with the manifest values pf our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of these schools are attended by <span class="highlight">children</span> of relatively poor families, a significant proportion of them ‘migrant or Aboriginal, whose schooling should offer a measure of redress for the economic and political disadvantages of their background rather than a compounding of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Interim Committee asks for action which will attempt, both within the schools and beyond them, to supplement the opportunities open to <span class="highlight">children</span> whose general conditions of life are least conducive to the development of scholastic ability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The chapter establishes beyond doubt the appalling variations in opportunities available to Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>, the cruel and senseless waste of potential skill, and the callousness with which this situation has been allowed to drift through the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I interpose the comment that the articulate sections of the population active in the interests of their <span class="highlight">children</span> are very much to be commended, not to be condemned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the <span class="highlight">children</span> who have no perceptive, intelligent and active advocates are not to be neglected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Low income parents, being generally ill educated themselves, do not establish habits associated with a high level of literacy as examples which their <span class="highlight">children</span> might follow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There will assuredly be no high quality in Australian education as long as there continues ‘to be public indifference and official complacency about the fate of <span class="highlight">children</span> in disadvantaged circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The years 1974 and 1975 will see the beginning of an effort to solve the very formidable problems in special education for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We will continue with the grants under our predecessors’ Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span> (Assistance) Act and also with grants for training teachers for special education under our teacher education programs in colleges of advanced education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Local communities and local government should become much more actively involved in supporting action for the families of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> and for the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our Department of Education, enlightened and guided by the Pre-School Commission and the Schools Commission-or in the event of the destruction of the Schools Commission by the Senate, the Interim Committee of the Schools Commission- should consider itself as having a special obligation to <span class="highlight">children</span> and young people up to the age of 1 8 who have these special needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To implement the report of the Interim Committee for the Schools Commission on the subject of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> we must develop a system of administration which actually expresses compassion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to detect need in <span class="highlight">children</span> we must face the fact that families most at risk are least likely to go voluntarily to infant welfare clinics, least likely to use child care centres, least likely to have the services of competent medical practitioners, social workers or psychological advisers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Research is needed to identify what characteristics of <span class="highlight">children</span> are most predictive of subsequent education and social difficulty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will recall that this Government extended the Aboriginal secondary grants scheme to cover all <span class="highlight">children</span> at secondary schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Programs to overcome this situation have been approved by me and include support of teachers colleges carrying out courses in Aboriginal education; compensatory teaching programs for <span class="highlight">children</span> in primary schools; support of a special college of Aboriginal education at Torrens in South Australia where a range of basic skills is taught, leading to further education or improved employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What more ideal moment could there be than the present moment when the Government states that it is being obstructed by the Senate, when the Government has announced that if the Senate attempts to make the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  carry out his promise to preserve basic grants for all schools the Government will deprive the <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australia of hundreds of thousands of dollars of educational aid and when the Government says that it believes that this issue is so vital that it wants to hold an election? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite know very well that in the inner areas of the big cities, particularly areas in which there are a large number of migrants- and the migrants have big families-out of 100,000 people 40,000 to 45,000 might be adults and 55,000 to 60,000 might be <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> attending Government Schools in the north-east of Victoria are deeply concerned at the Liberal Party’s proposed amendments to the Australian Schools Commission Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We feel that these amendments will discriminate against representation by government school parents and teachers, who represent the majority of Australian school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That a letter such as that could be written by a responsible organisation is in fact an indictment of the Press of this country, because it is only with the most gross misrepresentation of the facts related to this matter that any council of mothers clubs could believe that the amendments moved by the Opposition would discriminate against representation by the parents and teachers of school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is, as is well known to every member of this chamber, that one of the major aspects of the amendments which were moved by the Opposition and carried by this chamber was to provide a guarantee which does not exist in the Bill proposed by the Government that teachers and parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> attending government schools would be guaranteed a voice on the membership of the Schools Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An issue has been raised by 30 or 40 Press representatives of the Government that if we persist in opposing the kind of Commission that the Government wants we will stop the <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australia from getting $S00m worth of aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All that has happened is that this Government has decided to play political football with the welfare of the <span class="highlight">children</span> in the schools of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They eliminate the requirements for the Commission to have regard in the exercising of its functions to the primary obligation of governments to government schools systems that are of the highest standard and are open without fees or religious tests to all <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We say that the overall effect of the Opposition’s amendments will be to prevent the Schools Commission from being the national expert body to which the majority of the people of Australia are looking to improve the quality of education for all Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill provides for general building grants, supplementary science laboratory building grants, grants for recurrent expenditure, grants for libraries, grants for disadvantaged schools, for special schools for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> for teacher development and for special projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What it will do is reduce the amount of grant to 40 per cent of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australia who attend nonsystemic schools which they receive towards their education from Federal Government sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is so notwithstanding an acceptance of the view throughout this community that in these respects there are certain rights which go with <span class="highlight">children</span>, not with schools, not with their parents and not with some other relationship which may be attributable to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I pause there to comment that this Government, while taking away from schools in categories A to F, which represent over 53 per cent of all the <span class="highlight">children</span> at non-systemic schools, gives increased aid to schools in the Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition will stand firm on a principle in which it believes and in which I believe the majority of Australians believe; namely, the right of choice and the right to receive a basic grant towards education to enable the <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australia to enjoy that choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I invite honourable senators to listen very carefully to the terms of this motion, which are as follows: the House, while not refusing a second reading to the Bill, is of the opinion that it should provide for the establishment of an Australian Schools Commission to examine and determine the needs of students in government and non-government primary, secondary, and technical schools, and recommend grants which the Commonwealth should make to the States to assist in meeting the requirements of all school age <span class="highlight">children</span> on the basis of needs and priorities and that the application of this policy could not allow die continued acceptance of the provisions of the Bill and that therefore grants should not be made on the basis provided in the Bill in respect of any year after 1973 ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do honourable senators realise that a considerable number of <span class="highlight">children</span> who attend one of the socalled wealthy schools in Melbourne get there on scholarships and would not be able to attend this school otherwise? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even the arguments advanced by the Opposition about the alleged promises of the Government could not be interpreted in any reasonable sense as going beyond the rates of per capita assistance which were in force during 1972; that is, $50 for primary school <span class="highlight">children</span> and $68 for secondary school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our philosophy is that it is important in a free society that people be able to make a choice as to what school, what system of school and what type of education they wish their <span class="highlight">children</span> to receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Parents, such as the parents of the <span class="highlight">children</span> at the Australian International Independent school in Sydney, the Brisbane Independent Primary School and many of the other independent schools which are getting reduced aid or are not getting any aid, wish to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to those schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government would take any grant away from those <span class="highlight">children</span> because it wishes to stick rigidly to some demonstrably unsatisfactory hard line system of categorisation on the basis of wanting to apply some indefinite needs principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have been given evidence by the heads of some of the schools that are to receive nothing under this scheme that they provide scholarships for hundreds of poor <span class="highlight">children</span> to enable them to attend those schools without the payment of fees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Instead of the enrolments at such schools being diluted as they are today between <span class="highlight">children</span> whose parents are well off and <span class="highlight">children</span> whose parents are not well off, this Government will force them to become schools exclusively for the elite, for the upper class. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These 3 schools and the one referred to by  Senator McManus  have students whose parents have a modest background and, in fact, have to make considerable sacrifices to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to the schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We support the overall right of all citizens to a freedom of choice in education, a right that the State should recognise in an effective way by giving all citizens, all <span class="highlight">children</span>, some access to public funds for education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first basis, of course, is that the amendment gives expression to a basic principle that where aid is provided to non-government school <span class="highlight">children</span> that aid should be on a per capita basis and be available as a matter of principle to every child in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But at the same time this Government for the sake of about $5m per annum or, if we take the figure of $8m over 2 years which was mentioned last night by  Senator Douglas  McClelland, about $4m per annum, could apply the principle of an entitlement of a basic grant to all school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But apparently school <span class="highlight">children</span> come into some special category which is to be singled out for a different principle to be applied to them by this Government from that which is applied by the same Government to tertiary education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that the Australian Government has allocated $300,000 to replace radio receivers which are used in the education of <span class="highlight">children</span> in isolated areas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government has decided to replace radio receivers which are used in the education of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>, and the expenditure involved will be provided by the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because Australia is a party to the international agreement it is bound by the agreement to change fixed service high frequency radio transmissions from the double sideband to the single sideband by the end of 1977, and the expenditure of $300,000 to replace these sets for the education of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> will take place in that transitional period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Housewifes and <span class="highlight">children</span> are but 2 classes of examples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is so, why is the Government prepared to give an extra $2 7m for holidays to its public servants when it is not prepared to give an extra $5m for the education of <span class="highlight">children</span> in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In clause 13, after paragraph 3 (a), insert the following paragraph- (aa) the prior right of parents to choose whether their <span class="highlight">children</span> are educated at a government school or at a nongovernment school; ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see it as having a function in relation to <span class="highlight">children</span> attending single schools or who are within systems which are conducted by the Commonwealth Government, by State governments and by independent authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole tendency in this Government’s approach to the question of education has been to look at it from the point of view of the creation of and the interests of the institution which <span class="highlight">children</span> attend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that it is the <span class="highlight">children</span> in education who are important, and not the institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not recognise any system of apartheid under which some <span class="highlight">children</span> will have prior treatment over other <span class="highlight">children</span> according to the schools that they attend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also the very valuable statement by the Government that it seeks to add to the matters which the Commission is to take into account the prior right of parents- I understand that originally the provision read ‘the right of parents’- to choose whether their <span class="highlight">children</span> are educated at a government school or at a nongovernment school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are all qualifications in the direction of what my Party stands for, that is, the equality of Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> in education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as that is concerned, the argument that was originally raised was that people who had <span class="highlight">children</span> in independent schools had to contribute to the taxation which established the state school system and which is directed towards the state school system and also had to pay the fees of their own <span class="highlight">children</span> in independent schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have now arrived at another situation in which people who have <span class="highlight">children</span> attending certain schools that are designated to be wealthy schools -in a number of cases they are not- are worse off than ever before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They not only subscribe, through the taxation they pay, to the government schools and to the aid provided to other independent schools but also have to pay for the education of their own <span class="highlight">children</span> at schools which receive no assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point about it is this: Why make a distinction between Australian school <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet it makes a distinction between the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to Government senators: If you are to cater for the school <span class="highlight">children</span> of the nation in this way, cater for all of them and do not discriminate between them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely in this case the Labor Government should have been consistent and treated all Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> as Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our objective, despite what  Senator Wood  has said, is to obtain some equality of opportunity for all Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> in the educational scheme of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In previous debates on this Bill I have emphasised the great significance that the Government attaches to the role which the Schools Commission can play in developing programs of assistance for all Australian schools and school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These amendments merely refer to the right of parents to decide whether to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to a government or a non-government school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take this opportunity to indicate that we regard as of fundamental importance the acceptance of the principle that there is in a free society a prior right on the part of parents to choose whether their <span class="highlight">children</span> should be educated at one school or another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We regard research in relation to education as one of the most important developments which can occur to maximise the advantages which can come to the <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australia from developments in our education system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the levy to be imposed under the new scheme is based on capacity to pay, which means that it is based on one’s taxable income after allowance has been made for <span class="highlight">children</span> and educational medical and other expenses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is more noble an ambition than to see one’s <span class="highlight">children</span> properly educated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a man, his wife or <span class="highlight">children</span> suffer from some illness they will know that they are covered for the expenses incurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">children</span> who run bazaars at schools earn nearly that much now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On his own figures in the White Paper he has little <span class="highlight">children</span> on $20-odd a week paying $16.20 into the new scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person would have to be about 15 years of age with a couple of <span class="highlight">children</span> to receive that deduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Minister would say: ‘Well, if you do not have any <span class="highlight">children</span> on $20 a week you have to pay $ 1 6.20. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will also be sadly aware that among the drownings are a lot of <span class="highlight">children</span> of school age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government also has sought to have the Schools Commission established as an independent statutory advisory body which will recommend measures for raising the standards of education in schools and for eliminating inequalities in opportunity among Australian school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there is room for the principle for which the Liberal Party stands, and that is that there should be freedom of choice in education and that it is a fundamental concept in a free society that <span class="highlight">children</span> should not be forced into one form of education which is controlled by the Government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has set out to divide effectively those who are involved in the provision of an alternative education scheme and an alternative opportunity so that the people of this country, particularly the <span class="highlight">children</span>, have a choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill, as amended, does not ensure justice for all <span class="highlight">children</span> but it does guarantee that every Australian school child in 1974 and 1975 will share in the per capita finance made available by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are not, we will certainly continue to press the Government to adopt our policy of justice for all <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not giving aid to schools; we are giving aid to Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When people say that Scotch College in Melbourne or St Joseph’s College in Sydney should not be given any money because they are wealthy schools, they are saying that every one of the <span class="highlight">children</span> attending those schools is a wealthy child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody who has had any association with those schools knows perfectly well, firstly, that very large numbers of scholarships are given to <span class="highlight">children</span> who are in need and who attend those schools and, secondly, that many of the <span class="highlight">children</span> who attend them do so because their parents make sacrifices and in many cases both the father and the mother work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We regard this as merely a stepping stone to another campaign to get justice for schools and to establish the principle that we are not aiding schools which are the property of religious denominations; we are aiding Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> who are attending these schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said at the time that the matter is not one of schools but of Australian school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, the arrangements as they are now proposed which seek the approval of the Senate will enable the Government effectively to launch its education campaign and its education policies to bring equality of opportunity to all Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To have a divorce law that will meet these tests is of even greater importance where there are young <span class="highlight">children</span> who will be in contact with both parents after the divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have given a great deal of thought to whether there should be another ground to meet the cases such as where the husband repeatedly comes home drunk and beats up his wife and terrifies the <span class="highlight">children</span>, if not beating them as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed that my Department will prepare a suitable document setting out the consequences of divorce- particularly the consequences to the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the marriage- and that this document will be made available to courts, welfare officers and solicitors to give to all persons proposing to institute proceedings under the Act and also to their spouses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adoption of <span class="highlight">children</span>, testamentary guardianship and affiliation orders are the main matters it does not, and cannot, deal with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Act provides, and this Bill repeats, that the court must regard the interests of the <span class="highlight">children</span> as the paramount consideration, but otherwise the court may make such order as it considers proper in the circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is thus hoped that greater use will be made of the skills of welfare officers in matters relating to custody, access and the general welfare of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill allows the child itself, or any responsible organisation concerned with the welfare of <span class="highlight">children</span>, to apply to the court for separate representation of the child on the hearing of an application for custody, guardianship or access. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for maintenance, where there are <span class="highlight">children</span> of the marriage, especially very young <span class="highlight">children</span>, there is no doubt that a woman who is divorced or separated from her husband needs some financial assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, where the <span class="highlight">children</span> are older or where there are no <span class="highlight">children</span> and the wife is still comparatively young, it is surely in the wife’s own interest that she should become economically self sufficient by working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the Bill lays down the general proposition that a spouse is liable to maintain the other spouse to the extent that the other spouse is unable to support himself or herself adequately; and that both spouses are liable to maintain their <span class="highlight">children</span> according to their respective financial resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly there will be cases where a party seeking divorce- usually the housewife with young <span class="highlight">children</span>- will not be able to afford even the lower costs of divorce that will apply under the new Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parties to divorce proceedings may be spared these consequences towards making the effect of divorce on the <span class="highlight">children</span> less traumatic than it is at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has provided further assistance to organisations providing services to handicapped and subnormal <span class="highlight">children</span> and has provided considerably greater assistance to cultural groups in my State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  <span class="highlight">children</span> have lost a beloved father. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some independent schools of high educational standards will be forced to close with the consequences that <span class="highlight">children</span> attending those schools will have to attend government schools already over taxed and under staffed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-9-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parents should be encouraged to exercise freedom of choice of the type of school they wish for their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-9-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apparently the Royal <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Hospital Research Foundation cannot obtain funds to send this doctor to carry out the research. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister ascertain whether financial assistance can be provided to the respective widows and <span class="highlight">children</span> as it appears that nothing is required to be paid because the deceased had volunteered for civil defence duties? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Educate your <span class="highlight">children</span>, enlighten your <span class="highlight">children</span>, and then you are building up an asset for your future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only that, we provided an educational allowance of up to $304 a year for <span class="highlight">children</span> in their final 2 years of secondary school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What did we do about isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The rich get richer and the poor get <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I, like my colleagues, spent many hours in this chamber asking this Government not to take away the per capita grants from certain Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government seemed to be of the opinion that <span class="highlight">children</span> who are to receive any government assistance in their education must attend a government school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You must send your <span class="highlight">children</span> to a government school’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that people in the community prefer to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> either to a religious school or to some private school, for reasons of their own, does not matter to this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You must pay those taxes, and you must help with the upkeep of the schools to which you wish to send your <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are wealthy because people have worked and have made sacrifices to that their <span class="highlight">children</span> will get the best education money can provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Being in the position of representing the Minister for Education, I am unaware of any internal problems within the Government in relation to the implementation of the Government’s policy for pre-school <span class="highlight">children</span> or, for that matter, any other reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Assuming the correctness of the information which  Senator Sir Kenneth  Anderson has given, I think all Australians would deplore any kind of military action of this nature against <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Through the forum of this Parliament let me now address myself to the older members of my race- those who, like me, have suffered so much because of past discrimination and prejudice; those who, because of the attitudes of the past, have lived in squalor on the banks of creeks and have seen the destruction of their culture, yet have been able to fight back and to give their <span class="highlight">children</span> the best education that those conditions would permit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Governments still have not solved the high death rate of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> in many parts of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for Primary Industry aware of the concern recently expressed by teachers and parents, particularly at several schools in Tasmania, in relation to the withdrawal of free milk for school <span class="highlight">children</span> and the likely effect on the health of <span class="highlight">children</span>, particularly in lower income families? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the latest proposal of the Government in relation to the provision of free milk for school <span class="highlight">children</span>, or a suitable substitute? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can advise the honourable senator that, according to my colleague the Minister for Health, salmonella organisms are quite often implicated as an causative factor in outbreaks of gastro-enteritis, both in adults and in <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are migrants who are not able to vote, if there are <span class="highlight">children</span> who are not able to vote and if there are Aborigines who have not yet enrolled, those people will comprise part of the population- the non-voting population- yet they will be the persons who will be counted in determining the equality of electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first principle is that in future, although the vote is being guaranteed to all Australian citizens over the age of 18 years, electorates are to be drawn up in such a way that all the people, including <span class="highlight">children</span>- presumably even babies- unnaturalised Australians and others who do not enrol, will be included. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basis for it was evidence persuasive enough to indicate that <span class="highlight">children</span> aged between 2 years and 6 years could be affected adversely and permanently by being exposed to scenes of violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it has been suggested to me that <span class="highlight">children</span> younger than 2 years of age also could be affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not thought that the <span class="highlight">children</span> could be affected, but apparently they can be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am looking into the question of whether, in order to protect <span class="highlight">children</span>, there should be no such lower limit at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For the uninitiated, regulation 97 is a housing subsidy which provides eligible married officers with $33 a week towards their rent if they have no <span class="highlight">children</span> and $40 a week if they have <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus a mother with 3 <span class="highlight">children</span> over 6 years of age will now receive a maximum pension of $45 a week; this amount would be $47 a week if she were entitled to the higher rate of mother’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same rate of pension will be payable to a single age or invalid pensioner with <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that the <span class="highlight">children</span> will be delighted, and their mothers also, now that they know they can get it through a credit union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my home town there is a man who has a number of <span class="highlight">children</span> and works for the local council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One photograph shows the early part of the demonstration as being peaceful and orderly, with women with <span class="highlight">children</span> in pushers quietly going about their normal procedures- a normal scene at election rallies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the  unitiated,  regulation 97 is a housing subsidy which provides eligible married officers with $33 a week towards their rent if they have no <span class="highlight">children</span> and $40 a week if they have <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What he does not appreciate of course is that millions of men, women and <span class="highlight">children</span> have been killed by conventional weapons from conventional aggressors ever since World War II ended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the case of dissolution, provision shall be made for the necessary protection of any <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it to be in support of the family that there should be provisions to enable a marriage that has irretrievably broken down to be dissolved and proper provision made for any <span class="highlight">children</span> of that family, for fair adjustment of property interests, and for equitable maintenance on the basis of need, all in proceedings that are intended to avoid exacerbating relations between the parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, I do not think we have yet given nearly enough attention to the rights of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not so long ago that few would have regarded <span class="highlight">children</span> as having any rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>will be uniformly dealt with by federal law, except in relation to illegitimate <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In custody matters, the court is required by the Bill- as it is by the present Act- to regard the interests of the <span class="highlight">children</span> as the paramount consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This latter restriction will not, of course, apply to proceedings for the maintenance of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maintenance agreements and transfers of property between spouses, or to <span class="highlight">children</span>, pursuant to such agreements or to orders of the court are to be exempt from State and Territory stamp duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have also said before, this will not apply to applications for maintenance of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the present means test for deciding eligibility for the pensioner medical service for a couple without <span class="highlight">children</span> is $86.50 a week, whereas a couple without <span class="highlight">children</span> cannot be admitted to the subsidised health benefits plan unless they have a weekly income of $69.50 or less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For an annual cost of $40m, which would take about six years to attain, we could provide every Australian child with the opportunity- a means of equalising and enriching every child’s life for the rest of his life- now enjoyed fully only by <span class="highlight">children</span> in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has done it in relation to some <span class="highlight">children</span> but not in relation to all <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple position is that the Government, which is unable to reconcile its own internal differences, stands by and allows the Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> to suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I notice that in China, from the age of about 10 years, <span class="highlight">children</span> are taught something about war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if both of them were receiving $45 a week and if they had <span class="highlight">children</span> to enable them to claim $100 a year tax deduction, between them they would be paying almost $62 a year for the Government’s free medical scheme, in spite of the fact that they have 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, I suggest that the honourable senator go to the Australian Democratic Labor program and he will find that people on that sort of income- if that were their total family income with 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>- would pay nothing at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Health aware of the concern expressed by many teachers and parents over the effect of the withdrawal of free milk for school <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Government, in deciding to withdraw financial support for the free milk scheme, considered all aspects of the matter, but after detailed consideration and study it was unable to find evidence of nutritional deficiency which would warrant the issue of a particular food to school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These include $2.4m for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to provide for award wage employment of Aboriginals formerly employed under the training allowance scheme in the northern Territory; Department of Education, including $ 1.1m Tor secondary grants to Aboriginals and $1.3m for assistance to isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>; $ 1 1 .5m for the Department of Foreign Affairs for payment under the National Wheat Agreement- Food Aid Convention; $5.1m for the Department of the Media for increased costs of the Australian Broadcasting Commission; $1.5m for the Department of Minerals and Energy for oil search subsidies; $600,000 for the Department of Primary Industry for emergency adjustment assistance to the apple, pear and canning fruit industry; $2. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One cannot even rely upon the fact that <span class="highlight">children</span> will be taught at school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party is aware that the figures show that in Labor Party held electorates the number of <span class="highlight">children</span> is infinitely greater than in Liberal Party or non-Labor Party held electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that in this country, which has the greatest rate of home ownership in the world, people should be able to buy their own homes and contemplate that they have the basic deposit, that they have the ability throughout life to pay off the asset and to be able to give something to their <span class="highlight">children</span> when they die. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It refers to the tragic and chronic drought in Ethiopia and other pans of the African continent which has resulted, as the Minister would know, in widespread famine, disease and death, particularly among tens of thousands of infants and <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could see that there was great danger for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of these migrant people and for the <span class="highlight">children</span> who were born of migrant people in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some steps have been taken to make sure that those <span class="highlight">children</span> can go on learning in their native language, to learn and be proud of their native culture, but also quickly to learn and be proud to be part of our culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would look to the Government to take many more steps to ensure that more is done, because the future of a nation depends on its <span class="highlight">children</span>, and its <span class="highlight">children</span> are its wealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we give women the choice we have to safeguard the <span class="highlight">children</span> that they have had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mothers who stay at home looking after their <span class="highlight">children</span> teach their <span class="highlight">children</span> so much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span> learn so much from the day they are brought home from the hospital to the day they leave their parents’ home to go to their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those early years <span class="highlight">children</span> learn so much from a mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If mothers are to go out to work-it is obvious that they are going to go and nothing is going to stop them, be that right or wrong-we, as people who have some conscience and some role to play must make sure that the <span class="highlight">children</span> who are born of these women learn things that they would have learned from their mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think governments should take extraordinary action to safeguard <span class="highlight">children</span> and so safeguard the future of a nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This present stance of the Opposition reminds me of the attitude that we so often see taken by <span class="highlight">children</span> when they are playing because what the Opposition is trying to say is what schoolchildren say when things have not gone well for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again it is a question of raising the options and the freedoms of masses of the Australian people who cannot afford economically to make decisions which benefit their own <span class="highlight">children</span> and who have to rely on the system which is provided by the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, I believe that we, as a Government, have tried to instill into our community the idea that there is such a thing as economic freedom in terms of freedom from unemployment, freedom to make decisions about where you send your <span class="highlight">children</span> to school and freedom to make decisions about what you do with your leisure- all sorts of things which flow from a more equitable distribution of wealth in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Equity in sharing sacrifices as well as prosperity; and the need to ensure that any deferment of expectations shall not be made at the expense of those for whom deferment could mean a lifetime of deprivation- for example, <span class="highlight">children</span> at school and migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We realise that the Government, in bringing this legislation forward, is moving half way towards what it wants but it would have preferred to go much further the other way and to have everybody, adults and <span class="highlight">children</span>, counted in the electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Minister does not know the present position, in view of the urgency of providing care for the thousands of <span class="highlight">children</span> who are left unattended daily and in view of the undertaking in the Governor-General’s speech that the Government will be guided by the need to ensure that any deferment of expectations shall not be made at the expense of those for whom deferment could mean a lifetime of deprivation- for example, <span class="highlight">children</span> at school and migrants- will the Minister undertake to make urgent inquiries into the matter and provide an early answer to the Senate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be, because a doctor has to live, he has to raise his family and send his <span class="highlight">children</span> to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What matters in the end is the health care we receive, the health care actually received by my wife and <span class="highlight">children</span> as consumers of health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Acting Deputy President,  I put it to you that, if there are citizens of this country with <span class="highlight">children</span> who for some reason best known to themselves are not paying taxation and if their <span class="highlight">children</span> become sick, those people will feel a constraint or a reluctance to seek medical care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are women and <span class="highlight">children</span> in Melbourne who, if they wake up in the night, have no recourse to the services of a doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the urgent need of our <span class="highlight">children</span> in this regard, will the Minister undertake to release the report quickly? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I speak of the need of the single fathers, the supporting fathers, of <span class="highlight">children</span>, particularly pre-school age <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The government should assist disadvantaged families where a single parent, a father, is caring for <span class="highlight">children</span>, whether he is a widower or a deserted husband. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in this category there are some 25,000 families and perhaps up to 50,000 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The anomaly is that if a widow is caring for such <span class="highlight">children</span> there are government programs to assist her, but if a male parent has accepted the total responsibility for the <span class="highlight">children</span> there is no government assistance to which he is entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no recognition of the special need of the supporting father and the <span class="highlight">children</span> in such families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this type of disadvantaged family were embraced in a government program of social concern and social assistance, it would assist many fathers who are attempting to care for preschool age <span class="highlight">children</span> and younger <span class="highlight">children</span> who are in a financially disadvantaged position at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak not only of the fact that such fathers have to pay for housekeeping assistance to care for their <span class="highlight">children</span> but also of the fact that they face many other difficulties related to unemployment benefit and other things in respect of which they do not have access to government programs as a woman would have in the same circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask that he remember the case of supporting fathers and the needs of their <span class="highlight">children</span> in his next Budget considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The project arose as a result of a Film Australia film production of the same name which is aimed towards young <span class="highlight">children</span> and is designed to educate them in an entertaining way in the simple procedures of road safety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that some commercial television networks are interested in looking at some of these productions and that officers of the Department of Transport and my Department have been so impressed with the Film project and with the reception of it by a large audience of young <span class="highlight">children</span> that they have decided to proceed with the presentation of the comic strip. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet some 10 years ago in a location, namely Nowa Nowa, which is almost in the heart of his electorate a group of people were so depressed and concerned by the state in which the young Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> were living that they applied to the London office of the Save the <span class="highlight">Children</span> Fund to seek approval to build a kindergarten to provide some facilities for the little ones in that region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apparently the unsafe condition of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s harnesses in motor cars arises from the difficulty of adjusting the harnesses once they have been installed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose- 1 need not go into all this, but I assure the honourable senator that if something could be done to enable <span class="highlight">children</span> to be detained in proper conditions it would be done forthwith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact that sick persons and <span class="highlight">children</span> are detained in an institution where they should not be detained is a matter of merriment for honourable senators opposite because they cannot yet see their way clear to make a political stunt out of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this to them: If it is a question of whether <span class="highlight">children</span> should be detained in such a place- a place where they should not be detained- because there is no other place for them, the attitude I will take is that they ought to go free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is thought that anything can be done or has to be done, knowing as I do that this Government has the interests of <span class="highlight">children</span> at heart, we certainly will see that sympathetic consideration is given to the honourable senator’s representations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it also true that fathers of <span class="highlight">children</span> suffering chronic or long term illness can obtain extended periods of payment of this benefit only in very special circumstances and that approval of the benefit can be given only by the Director-General of Social Security? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suppose that within our traditional male chauvinist society it did cause a little confusion that the Government was at least recognising the fact that there were men who were placed in the position, which has traditionally been ascribed to women, of having the responsibility of looking after <span class="highlight">children</span> without the assistance of the mother of the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australian Government has pledged $A250,000 to UNICEF (disbursed in 1973-74 and 1974-75) for its Indo-China aid operation including its welfare programs for Vietnamese mothers and <span class="highlight">children</span> disadvantaged by the war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-82-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both the Cyprus Government and the United Nations agency concerned with this relief have indicated that after cash, which remains the first priority, the need on Cyprus is for non-perishable foods, such as tinned meat and fish, as well as blankets, towels and clothing, especially for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As one spokesman is reported as saying, if he has a wife and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> at 16, he has enough to worry about without tax as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party may believe that the decision to reduce the taxable education allowance struck a blow at privilege, but the decision hit not only private schooling which the Party hates so much; it also affected the parents of all <span class="highlight">children</span> who have to wear school uniforms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So by its intended attack on the minority of parents with <span class="highlight">children</span> at private schools this Government has slugged the majority of parents with <span class="highlight">children</span> at state schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have no compunction in saying that if they can afford to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to high class private schools they ought to be prepared to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I am concerned about is to ensure that the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the underprivileged and the working class in this country get an opportunity to obtain a decent education so that they can compete with the sons and daughters of the silvertails who could not give a damn about the working class. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The people there have not been able to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to those schools over the years because of the previous Government’s policies affecting primary producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many parents work very hard and in many cases mothers go to work, so that their <span class="highlight">children</span> can experience the benefits of the independent school system, not out of any sense of snobbishness or aloofness but because in some cases independent schools can offer something, in terms of their own enterprise that the State systems cannot offer because it does not choose to offer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There has been a continual call by the Opposition for some sort of package to deal with the entire economic ills of Australia at this time- a package which no other country has discovered and which, if the Labor Government were to produce it, would be opened by the Opposition with a gleeful innocence of <span class="highlight">children</span> delving into a show bag searching for something to criticise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our priorities are in areas such as education where we are concerned with the long term needs of the majority of Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes it is suggested that in being concerned with the needs of a majority of Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> we determine this nation’s capacity and wealth in the generations to come and how we keep up with the technological changes which are taking place in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In considering the needs of a majority of <span class="highlight">children</span> it is sometimes suggested that we neglect the private schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>True it is that we consider that <span class="highlight">children</span> in government schools have a greater educational priority than <span class="highlight">children</span> in private schools, but since this Government came to office it has made $23i4m available to private schools for building programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I draw attention to the plight of <span class="highlight">children</span> and parents in Australia who suffered for 23 years when seemingly nobody cared very much about child care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that time the Government viewed the <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australia either as pampered darlings, destined to fill the positions of privilege and status, or as some sort of factory fodder to be used to fill the needs and desires of big business and the <span class="highlight">children</span> were educated to that end and that end alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mothers of those <span class="highlight">children</span> were useful in that they bred the citizens who were needed to keep the system going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the morals appropriate to that action, industry wooed the women back to the work force without a care or thought for the fate of the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not maintain that because mothers go to work their <span class="highlight">children</span> are necessarily at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what I say is that when mothers are not at home 24 hours a day playing their traditional role the <span class="highlight">children</span> are at risk if society does not take steps to provide substitutes for all the roles a woman fills in the home at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that the <span class="highlight">children</span> will mature to satisfactory adulthood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not speaking of the traditional educational role of the kindergartens which are open from 9 a.m. to 12 noon 4 days a week, which most fortunate <span class="highlight">children</span> in the Australian Capital Territory and some <span class="highlight">children</span> outside it enjoy, but the sort of care that is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for all <span class="highlight">children</span> from the babe in arms to the teenager about to launch into the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After a period when there was a deal of discussion on what child care meant and when there was a deal of work to be done to move people from the thought that child care was not just kindergartens but really child care, this Government within the next few weeks will establish a <span class="highlight">children</span> ‘s commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the body which finds the motel room in which to put the woman and the child or <span class="highlight">children</span> so that they are not broken up, so that the <span class="highlight">children</span> do not suffer the traumatic experience of being taken away and put in a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In another area there is a residential kindergarten which was set up by kindergarten teachers because some 35 years ago they could see a need for city <span class="highlight">children</span> to have holidays in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They realised that rather than <span class="highlight">children</span> having holidays in the country there were <span class="highlight">children</span> in desperate need of being looked after and there was no where for them to go, except into government institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the parents to benefit most relatively from educational income tax deductions, in the past and even more in the future, are the parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> in government schools and this has a divisive effect in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What action does the Government propose to take to protect these parents and their <span class="highlight">children</span> from the folly of the Government’s action? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator also refers to the problems of people in isolated areas insofar as those problems relate to the rearing of families and giving their <span class="highlight">children</span> educational assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When members of the present Opposition were in government there was a lot of talk but little action about what was going to be done to assist <span class="highlight">children</span> in isolated areas educationally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the first things this Government did when it came into office was to move in the area of giving very substantial assistance to parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> in isolated areas for educational purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the benefits accruing to the <span class="highlight">children</span> in isolated areas as a result of the assistance given by the Government under its isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>’s program far outweigh any criticism that is now offered by the honourable senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security and I preface it by pointing out to the Minister that <span class="highlight">children</span> suffering from cleft lip and palate require orthodontal treatment, in some cases until they are in their teens, and that orthodontal treatment is very expensive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It could well be the case that healthy young <span class="highlight">children</span> who have been deprived of their mother’s care because of her having to go to hospital, because of her desertion of the husband or whatever other reason it might be, need constant care and attention in the same way as do sick <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his Budget Speech the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  announced the Government’s intention of increasing additional payments for <span class="highlight">children</span> of pensioners and beneficiaries by 50c a week to $5.50 a week, raising supplementary assistance and supplementary allowance, for pensioners and sickness beneficiaries, by $1 a week to $5 a week, and increasing double orphan’s pension by $ 1 a week to $ 1 1 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This allowance will be payable at the rate of $ 10 a week to parents or guardians of physically or mentally handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> who are cared for in a family environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The latter concern changes in the residence qualification for invalid pensions, widows’ pensions and supporting mothers’ benefits, payment of additional amounts for <span class="highlight">children</span> in the care of Class B widow pensioners, the payment of additional benefit for de facto wives of unemployment and sickness beneficiaries and the repeal of the ‘not deserving’ and ‘character’ provisions of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Single or widowed pensioners, including supporting mothers, who are eligible for supplementary assistance and have, say, 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>, will receive a maximum of $5 1 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The pension has proved of considerable assistance to people caring for <span class="highlight">children</span> who, in the circumstances outlined, have permanently lost all contact with their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This new allowance should be seen in the context of the broad program of education, training and general welfare for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> being developed by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is estimated that some 20,000 <span class="highlight">children</span> will qualify for the allowance and that the annual cost will be approximately $10m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A woman with a child of her own or a child who entered her care before she became a widow is a class A widow and attracts payment of a mother’s allowance and additional pension for the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Class B widows at present receive the same basic pension as class A widows but they do not receive the mother’s allowance nor the additional pension for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand an unmarried woman may be granted an age pension at age 60 or an invalid pension and, in addition, receive additional pension for each child in her care, and guardian’s allowance irrespective of whether she is the mother of the <span class="highlight">children</span> and irrespective of the date the <span class="highlight">children</span> entered her care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is therefore proposed to enable a mother’s allowance and additional pension for <span class="highlight">children</span> to be payable to class B widows who have the custody, care and control of any child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While de facto wives of pensioners are treated for pension purposes in the same way as legal wives if the relationship has existed for not less than 3 years, de facto wives of beneficiaries only attract additional payments if they are accepted as unpaid housekeepers, that is, if they are keeping house for the beneficiary and one or more of his <span class="highlight">children</span>, provided they are substantially dependent on the beneficiary and not employed by him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the case of a married person with 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> the allowances would amount to $69.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill provides for an increase in the addition to service pension on account of <span class="highlight">children</span> and an increase in the rate of supplementary assistance or, as it is often referred to, ‘rent allowance’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This allowance is paid to a widow who has a dependent child or <span class="highlight">children</span>, including fulltime students, a widow who is over the age of 50 years, or one who is unemployable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The allowances paid under the soldiers’ <span class="highlight">children</span> education scheme to students undertaking secondary education, or industrial or agricultural training, will be increased by about 13 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Overall, about 4,500 <span class="highlight">children</span> are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, there will be an increase in the addition to pension payable in respect of <span class="highlight">children</span> in the custody, care and control of the pensioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why do the terms of reference, published on 21 August 1974 by the Special Miniser of State, confine themselves to matters of sexual practice, abortion and so on and why specifically do they not include the concern for the rights of <span class="highlight">children</span> and for human life set out in the resolution of the Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Divorce can thus be seen as actually contributing to marriage stability, by rechannelling conflicting partners and their <span class="highlight">children</span> into more viable family settings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It would create the concept of joint custody under the law, providing for representation of <span class="highlight">children</span> in cases where their interests are different, possibly, from those of both their parents and where the court feels they ought to be represented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill provides for compulsory conferences in many cases with welfare officers so that the problems, disputes and hatreds can be avoided and so that common sense in the interests of the <span class="highlight">children</span> can prevail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It must be obvious surely that it is a very relevant aspect when the decision is to be made as to which parent will have custody of the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Often what happens in that period is that the parties grow to hate each other; they have fights over maintenance, custody and access, and it finishes with the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the marriage no longer seeing one parent again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I really believe that in that second year very little is achieved in preserving the marriage or the interests of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One provision says that <span class="highlight">children</span>’s opinions, views and wishes on matters of custody should be taken into account by the court when it is making orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some <span class="highlight">children</span> of 14 years of age are mature; others are strongly under the influence of one parent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned earlier that there is the possibility of harshness being done to wives who have served and helped their husbands for many years, who have brought up the <span class="highlight">children</span> and who find themselves turned away, and denied maintenance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the other case where a wife may leave her husband to go to live with some other man for many years and the husband may be left to bring up the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Commonwealth legislation at present very little can be printed but under the State maintenance legislation, which is to be taken over by this Bill, we want to see the same restriction on this type of publicity which is hurtful to <span class="highlight">children</span>, harmful to individuals and of no benefit to the people generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been estimated, for example, that in England some 40 per cent of illegitimate <span class="highlight">children</span> are born to stable illicit unions- that is the sort of union formed by people who for some reason or other, say a dog in the manger attitude on the part of the spouse who will not divorce, are not able to contract a second marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, there is no role for the States or for the courts to intervene to bring a marriage to an end which, for all practical purposes, is dead and which surely, if only in the interests of the <span class="highlight">children</span>, should be decently buried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, whilst I think we can look forward to a social consciousness developing which will eliminate the notion of maintenance altogether, at the present stage of the development of our institutions, having regard to the fact that there is still a large generation of women who have undertaken as their sole life work the upkeep of a home and the nurture of their <span class="highlight">children</span>, account has to be taken of these people with these attitudes and in this situation in life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think I need labour this point because surely there would be a consensus among all honourable senators that proceedings between husband and wife in a dissolution of marriage or proceedings involving <span class="highlight">children</span> in matters of maintenance and custody are really their concern alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter what new ideas come, we must try now to protect the stable bonding of man and woman and provide a stable situation in which <span class="highlight">children</span> can be brought up and protected and in which family life can be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that one of the things we wish to do for <span class="highlight">children</span> in our society is to teach them about the kind of relationships that go into a marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They may have stopped working when they were 21 or 22 years of age and spent the next 20 years bringing up their <span class="highlight">children</span>, but at the age of 45 years they may be told to go back to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am very keen to ensure that under this Bill we do not create the situation where a whole generation of women who have contributed to family life and to the bringing up of <span class="highlight">children</span> are now left with nothing but the chance to go back and work for subsistence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have known people wanting custody of their <span class="highlight">children</span> who have been alcoholic or psychiatrically disturbed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been recorded that people seeking custody of their <span class="highlight">children</span> have been cruel and sadistic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He commented, as we all know, that divorce is a crisis in the lives of all the people involved- the two parents and the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see them operating to offer therapy to people at a time of crisis, to help <span class="highlight">children</span> through a period when they are likely to get very disturbed, and to help men and women who have to make decisions about their own worth and future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attention should be given to helping people to live better in the divorced state and to getting the <span class="highlight">children</span> used to the idea that they are going to exist without one or other parent in the house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present adversary system is, in my submission to the Senate, singularly unsuitable for the trial of matrimonial issues which under a fault system involve a meticulous examination of the most minute details of marital life to be conducted in an atmosphere of bitter recrimination, usually involving relatives and <span class="highlight">children</span> and sometimes dividing families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say without hesitation that a vast amount of the money that has been paid to lawyers over the years under the present system would have been far better spent in being applied to the proper purposes of the family, including the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also pleased to see the opportunity taken for the introduction in the Bill of a uniform Australian law concerning maintenance of spouses and <span class="highlight">children</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effects of that sort of attitude of the fault concept in divorce is measured not so much in terms of its effect upon the parties, which is bad, but more particularly in the effects upon the <span class="highlight">children</span> of divorced couples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The consequent effects not only on those parties but also on the <span class="highlight">children</span>, if there are any, is one of complete breakdown- if I can use an expression which we are now using in another contextof any possibility of the continuation of a viable human relationship either within or without marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effects on <span class="highlight">children</span> are simply that frequently a mother or a father has to explain his or her conduct and what has happened to the marriage by saying to the <span class="highlight">children</span>: ‘Your father is not here any longer because he is an adulterer’, ‘because he is a drunkard’, ‘because he has been in prison’ or because of the sort of reasons which are set out in section 28 of the present legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only does that undermine for all time the relationship between the 2 parties to the marriage but it seriously undermines, in my view, the possibility of a proper relationship being arrived at after divorce by the parents with each other and with their <span class="highlight">children</span> so that some degree of family fabric and a proper relationship may be maintained for the benefit of those <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The experience of most legal practitioners, of most marriage guidance counsellors and indeed of the majority of commentators on the present divorce legislation has led them to the conclusion that the legislation of 1959 is not working in 1 9 74, that the legislation of 1 9 5 9 is no longer socially desirable, that divorce will go on and that in 1974 if that is the case it is desirable that divorces be conducted with the utmost dignity for the people involved and more particularly for the <span class="highlight">children</span> involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge senators who have some doubts left as to whether the present fault ground should be maintained to spend some time in the forthcoming break visiting divorce courts or magistrates courts in which matters relating to custody of <span class="highlight">children</span>, maintenance and so on are being dealt with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite senators who are concerned about the maintenance and custody of <span class="highlight">children</span> to visit magistrates courts and observe the atmosphere in which these matters are dealt with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I may sound as though I am talking at a level which is not in keeping with a very modern attitude towards the independence of people, even within the marriage set-up, but fundamental to our society through the ages has been the principle that the husband is responsible for the wellbeing of his wife and his <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second portion of clause 5 1 relates to the maintenance of <span class="highlight">children</span> who have not attained the age of 18 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has to be greater consideration given to <span class="highlight">children</span> under 18 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This could well call for an amendment to clause 26 of the Bill which would increase the period of separation to 3 years in the case of a family in which there are <span class="highlight">children</span> under the age of 18 but retain the period of 1 year where the <span class="highlight">children</span> have been brought up and are over the age of 18 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also true that it imposes upon the parties to a marriage a legal duty to maintain their <span class="highlight">children</span> until the <span class="highlight">children</span> are aged 18 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It clearly states, with respect to the custody of, guardianship of or access to <span class="highlight">children</span> of a marriage, that the court shall regard the welfare of the <span class="highlight">children</span> as the paramount consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if one weighs the arguments for and against the proposed Family Law Bill; if one takes into account the fact that the majority of people have not been in a position to study the Bill and do not have a clear picture of the implications of the Bill; and if one has serious doubts whether the Bill promotes marriage and the family as stable institutions guaranteeing the healthy nurture of <span class="highlight">children</span>, one cannot but have feelings of grave doubt with respect to the enactment of this Bill in its present form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At end of motion add- but the Senate is of the opinion that the Government should consent to the incorporation in it of a provision making widowers and deserted husbands with dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> eligible for benefit on the same basis as widows and deserted wives’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of interest to us to notice that the Government has provided additional payments to <span class="highlight">children</span> of pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are delighted to see that the Government has sought to introduce a handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We support the inclusion in this year’s Budget of $ 10 a week as a payment to parents or guardians of physically or mentally  / handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> under the age of 16 who are cared for in a family environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that this measure which provides $10 a week and which will cover approximately 20,000 <span class="highlight">children</span> should have the support of all members of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>concept of parental roles in relat-‘ jil to <span class="highlight">children</span> is changing and it will be well for the Government and people in this country to recognise that no longer is it the exclusive responsibility of the mother to stay in the home to care for and bring up the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some cases this role has been forced upon the father who has become a single parent by the loss of a wife through either death, or desertionindeed a single parent who has been deserted and who has been given the custody of his <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen figures which show that there are approximately 25,000 families in this category covering approximately 50,000 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the formation of the Budget I spoke in the Senate of the hope that I had that it would be possible this year to assist supporting fathers and the <span class="highlight">children</span> in those families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had hoped, too, that there may have been recognition by the Government of the work of the voluntary associations as groups of people with a common problem hoping to achieve the best for the <span class="highlight">children</span> who are their responsibility, and that perhaps some Government assistance would be given for the administration of those associations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in this situation we are talking about the <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia who are increasing in number to such an extent that at least some 50,000 of them need assistance, and perhaps financial assistance to help to ease the disadvantage which they suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a proposal to have included in this Bill an allowance for supporting fathers, if we can call it  that  treating the widowed, the deserted father, the supporting father with dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> in the same way in which widows are treated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So often the hours of care that these fathers need to give to quite young <span class="highlight">children</span> make it difficult for them to continue in the work for which they have been trained and in which they have been engaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that this sort of recognition is given perhaps at the same time as we are talking about the need for child care facilities for all of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of working parents in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be recalled that the Minister mentioned the idea of providing a wage for the mother who is employed totally in the home in caring for young <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that for this reason the wording of our amendment is wide enough to allow deserted husbands with dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> to be eligible to receive benefits on the same basis as widows and deserted wives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognise that many income earning fathers in this situation would be means tested in such a way that possibly they would be excluded from receiving many of the benefits that are paid to a widow who is in the same situation of caring for young <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having taken this opportunity to express again our concern about this group in the community we hope that the Government will show new initiative in recognising the need and not talk about it any further, not set up a commission or an inquiry, but recognise the immediate need and the value of our proposal which will advantage many <span class="highlight">children</span> throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are very pleased about what it does offer, about the fact that there is to be additional payment for <span class="highlight">children</span> of pensioners and beneficiaries, raising the payment from $5 to $5.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It recommended changes in taxation deductions for dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> and further increases in the basic rate of pensions, and sickness and unemployment benefits, special benefits, and supporting mothers’ benefits, but in not one of those areas has the benefit been increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It recommended that a pension and fringe benefits as are paid to widows and subject to similar conditions be paid to men bringing up <span class="highlight">children</span> on their own, but again no action was taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Senate are able only to move an amendment expressing the Senate’s opinion that the Government should consent to the incorporation of this provision for widowers and deserted husbands with dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that, at the moment, a supporting father- that is, a father who is trying to raise <span class="highlight">children</span> by himself without the assistance of a mate- raises his <span class="highlight">children</span> under a special disability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is estimated that at present something like 25,000 families and 50,000 <span class="highlight">children</span> are affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the emphasis should be placed on the 50,000 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hardship caused to the father is readily apparent, but we should be very concerned about the hardship that is caused to the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While this is a comparatively small need, it is nevertheless, in the case of individual <span class="highlight">children</span>, a total need when they are in that position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position that many fathers, who have to raise <span class="highlight">children</span> on their own, are presently put into is that either they must go to work and almost compulsorily turn their <span class="highlight">children</span> into latch-key <span class="highlight">children</span> with virtually no choice because they get no special assistance for whatever costs they may incur in making arrangements for the <span class="highlight">children</span>- I refer particularly to those costs which are necessarily incurred for the care of very young <span class="highlight">children</span>- or they must put their <span class="highlight">children</span> in the care of either their parents or elderly relatives, or they must institutionalise them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event, I would think, and I would imagine that everybody would agree with me, that the stable family life is the one we wish to see all Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> enjoy, and I think putting the emphasis on the effect of this type of situation on this admittedly comparatively small number of <span class="highlight">children</span> is what we should be concentrating on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think in the case of a man who wishes to stay at home to care for his <span class="highlight">children</span> full time or who wishes to take a part-time job and receive a part-time pension, there should be no difference made between him, in that reduced earning capacity, and women who have been in that capacity traditionally for a long time in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked him whether it was true that fathers of <span class="highlight">children</span> suffering chronic or long-term illness could obtain extended periods of payment of this benefit only in very special circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest that the criteria for the payment of benefit- age, physical or mental disability- rules out persons who are bringing up <span class="highlight">children</span> of their own in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wheeldon went on to say that any supporting father suffering hardship as a result of having to remain at home from work to look after his <span class="highlight">children</span> may qualify for special benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would not be expected, for example, that all fathers would claim the full amount because not all the <span class="highlight">children</span> involved are fully dependent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some <span class="highlight">children</span> in the 16 to 21 age group would not be eligible and a means test also operates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are providing for an increase of 50c a week to $5.50 a week in the rate of additional payments for <span class="highlight">children</span> of pensioners, supporting mothers and unemployment and sickness beneficiaries; an increase of $ 1 a week to $5 a week in the rate of supplementary assistance and supplementary allowance; the removal of the residence requirement for invalid pension where permanent incapacity or blindness occurs in Australia; changes in the residence qualifications for widows’ pensions and supporting mothers’ benefits to permit a woman who becomes a widow or supporting mother while absent from Australia to obtain a pension or benefit on return to Australia if she has lived in Australia for 10 years continually at any time; payment of a mother’s allowance and an additional pension for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of class D widows; and the repeal of the ‘character’ and the ‘not deserving’ provisions of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition we are providing for the payment of additional benefits to the de facto wives of unemployment and sickness beneficiaries where the relationship has existed for not less than 3 years; an increase of $ 1 to $ 1 1 a week in the rate of double orphan’s pension; the introduction of a handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance of $10 a week- the introduction of that allowance; a means-test-free incentive allowance to $5 a week in lieu of supplementary assistance for people receiving the sheltered unemployment allowance; and changes in the rehabilitation provisions to make training and living away from home allowances payable at rates comparable with those under the national unemployment and training system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was tremendously happy about this because it involved not only the husband and wife but often the <span class="highlight">children</span> as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I found in some people a strong desire- in fact, I think one can pick the people with this desire- to resume their relationship together, to go on and be sensible and normal citizens in the community fulfilling their social obligations, playing their role in the community, bringing up their <span class="highlight">children</span> and providing the necessities of life for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I indicate that clearly the direction of Government policy is that people, especially young people, ought to be able to get, at reasonable rates of interest, advances which are sufficient to enable them to get the kind of homes they want in which to bring up their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The necessity for fault to be established, the very harming effects of publicity being directed towards the faults of either party and the attitude that must be engendered in the minds of <span class="highlight">children</span> who are party to a divorce proceeding lead me to believe that the law existing at this time is not necessarily appropriate to this day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At present human relationship discussions in schools do not deal with the very problems which are found in marriages and with the general concern that may be felt by either partner as the flush of a new marriage wears off and as both partners must get down to the business of living and the problems of rearing <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A woman with small <span class="highlight">children</span> should feel she can go to the local town hall or some such place and find out factually what happens, what to do, how much it will cost because, really, there is nowhere she can find out these things other than by making an appointment and fronting up to a solicitor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose we all know of cases in which grandparents and aunts were in fact, if not in deed, parents and <span class="highlight">children</span> have almost literally been dragged out of their arms to be sent to strangers whom they did not know merely because they were part of the property of those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The main aim of any divorce Bill should be the welfare of the <span class="highlight">children</span>, I believe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that in this instance it will not be a tongueinthecheek effort, which other attempts have been in the past, but a real striving to make sure that no matter what happens to the adults the <span class="highlight">children</span> have been catered for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can be sorry for adults who are caught up in all sorts of difficult circumstances, but <span class="highlight">children</span> cannot help themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I note that under this Act no decree will be issued unless the Court is satisfied about the welfare of the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that although welfare workers will be used to ascertain the needs and desires of <span class="highlight">children</span>, not too much emphasis will be placed on what have become known as welfare workers, with all that the term implies, but that a lot of emphasis will be placed on a great deal of informal, friendly, helpful discussion to find out what truly is needed for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a whole generation of women who have devoted their lives to home, <span class="highlight">children</span> and husband. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no more honourable profession than having brought up <span class="highlight">children</span> well, in a good home and provided all the ancillary services that husbands need so they can earn a livelihood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are entitled to assistance for the years of work that they gave to the <span class="highlight">children</span>, the home and the care of a husband. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even those who after the divorce say I will manage and I will look after my <span class="highlight">children</span> and my home’, still have 2 jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new wife and her <span class="highlight">children</span> also have rights and should not be expected to be deprived and forced out to work to provide for the lazy, good for nothing and often neurotic woman whose own ineptitude or greed caused the breakdown of the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every chance must be taken to make sure that we are safeguarding <span class="highlight">children</span> and those who are unable to take care of themselves, remembering that our prime aim is to establish a decent divorce law without the concept of fault. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it should achieve this in a way that is just to all concerned, including the <span class="highlight">children</span> as well as the spouses, and which causes them the minimum of embarrassment and humiliation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, it should seek to take the heat out of the disputes between husband and wife and certainly not further embitter the relationships between them or between them and their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should not merely bury the marriage, but do so with decency and dignity and in a way which will encourage harmonious relationships between the parties and their <span class="highlight">children</span> in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think it is incontrovertible that the status of marriage and the relationship between the parties to marriage and the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the marriage are absolutely of fundamental human importance to all those who enter into marriage and indeed to those who decide not to enter into it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Other members of the community, particularly the <span class="highlight">children</span> of a marriage, are also vitally affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am prepared to recognise that in certain unfortunate circumstances this institution may well break down, and in that event it is in the interests of all concerned, including the <span class="highlight">children</span>, that it should be dissolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before going on to consider the changes that the Bill makes to grounds for divorce and maintenance, to the courts and so on, I would like briefly to refer to the view that not only should the law on marriage and divorce buttress and encourage the marriage state and the permanent union of the parties to marriage for the sake of their own happiness and that of their <span class="highlight">children</span>, but I believe the Government also should be more active in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the most significant advances in the law of accident and sickness compensation proposed in this Bill is the recognition of the right to compensation of non-earners, such as housewives and <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many wives are concerned about getting maintenance and custody of the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although this Bill does away with the concept of fault in the situation of divorce it does not completely do away with the concept of fault and or responsibility in the amendments, as I see them, when maintenance and custody of <span class="highlight">children</span> are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From what I have seen and from what I have heard from my colleagues, the maintenance provisions and the provisions concerned with the custody of <span class="highlight">children</span> will be explained and will be made clear to us all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find great difficulty in accepting some of the proposals particularly in relation to the wife who is wholly dependent on her husband and, indeed, in the final analysis in relation to the welfare of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the main the family unit- the combination of husband and wife- is responsible for both the procreation and the rearing of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, under this Bill the concept of fault is preserved with respect to proceedings relating to the custody of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason that that situation is different from the question of breaking or dissolving a marriage, that the latter is so much more emotional, is because there is the matter of justice in the area of property, joint property which has been earned through joint effort which must be justly and reasonably settled and because, crucially, it is highly likely that the marriage will include a giving birth to <span class="highlight">children</span> and the welfare of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the marriage must be paramount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should leave the way open for those who will recognise that they are living together in the state of marriage and as it is a very poor state and a sham, continuation of that state is bad for their <span class="highlight">children</span> and bad for them as individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More often they are symptoms of the breakdown of the marriage but we force members of our society to go through a wholly undignified and in many cases extremely degrading process in order to terminate a relationship which has left in it no potential for good for them, for their <span class="highlight">children</span> or for the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr President,  I wish to speak at quite some further length on the effects of this aspect on <span class="highlight">children</span> and on the potential effects of this Bill on the status of women in our society, as a reflection of their status and on just how we can hope through a Bill which deals with personal relationships to come to a fair law which will enable reality to be reflected and will enable people to live believing that they have been justly treated, knowing that they have behind them what is regarded as a social failure but also knowing that they at least have an equal chance of living a decent life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw the Minister’s attention to the fact that there are, all over the country, grandparents battling to bring up grandchildren left in their care and that very often the only income is the age pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That some parents who have chosen to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to a non-government school will have to withdraw their <span class="highlight">children</span> and send them to government schools already over crowded and understaffed! <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the parents to benefit most relatively from educational income tax deductions, in the past and even more in the future, are the parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> in government schools and this has a divisive effect in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That an alternative system, a tax rebate system, could be adopted as being more equitable for all parents with <span class="highlight">children</span> at school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The sand causes buildings to topple, blows into every nook and cranny under the pressure of high winds, penetrates stationary engines, ruins the mechanisms of vehicles and causes eye troubles among the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no doubt that a preliminary meeting at Weipa yesterday, under the chairmanship of  Mr Joe  McGuinnes of Cairns, who is well known for his radical left-wing attitudes, is nothing more than designed to tear at the heartstrings and the emotions of such people, who are well adjusted, and are bringing up their <span class="highlight">children</span> as normal and conventional Queenslanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All my <span class="highlight">children</span> were born there, and were partially raised and partially educated there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President,  they wish to give their <span class="highlight">children</span> the same opportunities that you, I and everybody else wish to give our <span class="highlight">children</span>, but the Aborigines still have this desire to go back on occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is on special occasions that they wish to go back to that place, when there are stories that they must relate to the <span class="highlight">children</span>- stories of the Dream Time and of the culture of the Aboriginal community prior to the white man that they wish to tell to the younger generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I visited there I saw Aboriginal women and their <span class="highlight">children</span>, babes in arms, living in a series of constructions which consisted of 2 sheets of galvanised iron 6 feet long and 3 feet in height, side by side, with a sheet of iron over the top. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The population statistics for Aboriginals in 1971 show that, of some 106,290 individuals, 53,919 were male adults and <span class="highlight">children</span> and 52,371 were females. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That we have read the petitions concerning the Family Law Bill and support the bill as sufficiently protecting the legal and social rights of women and <span class="highlight">children</span> in the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-1-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I attract his attention to an article in this month’s issue of ‘Choice’ magazine which discusses the safety of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s floatation toys. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Attorney-General aware of the article and the magazine’s claim that <span class="highlight">children</span> run the risk of being drowned because the toys are being passed off as safety floats? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear, being toys, that the <span class="highlight">children</span> using them should at all times be under the supervision of adults. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable senators I would like to mention at this point that this legislation will in no way supersede the operation of other legislation under which the Australian Government assists the provision of residential accommodation for disabled persons engaged in sheltered employment or for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> receiving training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer, of course, to the Sheltered Employment (Assistance) Act and the Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span> (Assistance) Act respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legislation was passed by the Parliament in last year’s Budget session, enabling local government borrowing to attract subsidy under the Sheltered Employment (Assistance) Act and the Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span> (Assistance) Act, which are ‘companion’ Acts to Aged Persons Homes Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said a minute ago that in fact the Family Law BUI can only reflect the situation of women and <span class="highlight">children</span> in society today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly believe that parents- a man and a woman who marry and decide to become parents- have a joint responsibility for as long as those <span class="highlight">children</span> are dependent, whether or not the man and the woman continue to remain in a state of matrimony. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is a divorce a very serious question has to be considered- how those <span class="highlight">children</span> are to be maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be nice to believe that if the man obtained custody of the <span class="highlight">children</span> the ex-wife would then make the same sort of financial contribution to their upkeep as the ex-husband would in the reverse situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The dependent members of our society who have been put in the position of being dependent because of those attitudes- basically the women and <span class="highlight">children</span> of our society- must be guarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general statement can fairly be made that most women between the ages of 25 and 40 withdraw from the work force because they become mothers and they have to care for their <span class="highlight">children</span> to the stage when they feel the <span class="highlight">children</span> are old enough or independent enough to look after themselves and where harm will not be done to the families if the women do go out to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently in Australia facts have emerged- facts in the sense that they are facts which now can be counted- relating to the battered wife and battered <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have always known that there were battered wives and battered <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia, but only recently have enough of these women come forward, had access to groups like Women’s Electoral Lobby and others which have made their mark in this area, for us to start to count just how big a problem this is in Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A conservative assessment currently is that approximately 5,000 families in Australia are in a situation where the husband habitually batters the wife and, almost inevitably in those circumstances, the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to recognise now that there are some men in our society who, whether under the influence of alcohol, because they are mentally disturbed, or because they are just plain bullies, do severely mistreat their wives and their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of them mistreat only the wife, but the social effects on the <span class="highlight">children</span> are absolutely appalling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is appropriate that there be some sort of safeguard in this Bill for women and <span class="highlight">children</span> in that situation whereby they can be protected promptly through a court injunction so that they may be given some hope of getting out of this absolutely appalling situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to make just one other brief comment on the subject of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also said frequently outside the House and brought forward as an argument against making the sort of amendment that this sort of Bill proposesthat the breakdown of a marriage has a bad effect on the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had quite some experience with adolescent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was in the situation of being a resident teacher in a girl’s boarding school for some years and came into very close contact with the sort of problems that <span class="highlight">children</span> in this age group, and undoubtedly also younger <span class="highlight">children</span>, face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt at all that a broken home, a home in which divorce has taken place, in which there is only one parent, leads to problems for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of that family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I say quite categorically, and I would debate it with anyone, that the problems I have witnessed and that many other people involved with youth have witnessed in that situation are as nothing compared with the sort of problems of the <span class="highlight">children</span> who live in a desperately unhappy home- the trauma that those <span class="highlight">children</span> go through when parents are fighting, bickering and endeavouring to tear one another apart, frequently using their <span class="highlight">children</span> as pawns and the means of doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My experience has been overwhelmingly to the effect that the unhappy home has a far more deleterious effect on <span class="highlight">children</span> than the broken home where there is only one parent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all else, because it is the key to anybody’s concern with a Bill relating to the family or divorce, we have to give the means for justice and a decent life to the really innocent parties- the <span class="highlight">children</span> of those broken down marriages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They recognise too that marriage creates, both by the unity of the  2  spouses and by the creation of <span class="highlight">children</span>, an enduring responsibilitya lifelong responsibility- to the discharge of which it is essential that that marriage should if possible be sustained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because there are victims to a marriage- that is, one or more spouses and of course the <span class="highlight">children</span>- the law intervenes to enforce responsibilities and sanctions and, if possible, to safeguard and protect the victims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when we traverse such vital matters as custody, where the <span class="highlight">children</span> shall go, the court is charged with studying comparative conduct- in fact, studying misconductbecause clearly the court must find whether there was adultery, whether there is continuing adultery, whether there was cruelty or whether there was outrageous conduct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there to be no recognition at all of the sacrifices of a young mother in helping a struggling young professional man to get on in this world, in bearing his <span class="highlight">children</span> and helping to raise them, in helping him to widen his status? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Norway the relevant facts are that a separation order may be granted automatically at the request of both parties or at the request of one party if one of the following facts can be proved: (a) Failure of maintenance of spouse or dependants, neglect of duties or continuous abuse of intoxicants; (b) disagreement or discord between the parties in which it would be unreasonable for them to continue cohabitation having regard to their own well being or that of their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What does the legislation in fact contribute to the position of <span class="highlight">children</span> disillusioned by the circumstances of the problems with which this legislation tends to grapple? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It results in broken dreams, broken families and disillusioned <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mrs Whitlam  referred to <span class="highlight">children</span> of that time as being brought up in a kibbutz style situation, as <span class="highlight">children</span> of the community rather than as members of a family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Family law, as I understand it, is the law which governs the relationships between men and women and parents and <span class="highlight">children</span> and particularly when that relationship is governed by the institution of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I suppose the areas covered by family law legislation could be said to include the establishment of marriage and the dissolution of marriage, the wellbeing and the protection of <span class="highlight">children</span> and the maintenance of affected persons in this relationship, the arrangements connected with property and all of the legal consequences that are similarly connected with these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the network of responsibilities and disciplines to which I have referred affect also other persons in our community mainly, of course, the <span class="highlight">children</span> of such a union and marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When there are <span class="highlight">children</span> in the family, their welfare in all its aspects becomes the prime consideration in any decision regarding the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the responsibility of civil authorities to provide an ordered procedure for the dissolution in law of a broken marriage and to ensure that such a dissolution will be effected only after all possibility of reconciliation has been exhausted and after satisfactory arrangements have been made for the welfare of any <span class="highlight">children</span> in the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, guilt or innocence is no longer to be taken into account when determining which party to the divorce is most suited to have custody of the child or <span class="highlight">children</span> under 18 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unwilling party to a divorce- for example, a husband or wife who has simply been deserted by a spouse- seems to me to have no right to maintenance unless he or she has the custody of <span class="highlight">children</span> under 1 8 years of age or can prove a need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">children</span> of today are magnificently trained for every vocation, every career and every recreation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From my discussions with him, I believe that  Senator Murphy  would wish to add 3 other criteria- The future of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of a broken marriage needs consideration by the best possible tribunal assisted by the skills of welfare officers and other counselling staff wherever needed; the financial disputes between the spouses should be resolved as quickly and finally as possible; the whole process should be performed with dignity, relative privacy and with as little expense as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is about family conflicts- not divorce; it therefore deals with the welfare of <span class="highlight">children</span>, maintenance, property, protection of the marriage and the people involved therein (by injunction if necessary), marriage counselling, on going help in custody and access problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting also to note, for those who are endeavouring to bring to the forefront of the debate the problems of young <span class="highlight">children</span>, that some 33 per cent of all the divorces which take place in this country involve no <span class="highlight">children</span> at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All people, as was pointed out here today, I think, from the most primitive to the most civilised, have evolved the most complicated set of mores and rules with regard to sex, marriage and the procreation of <span class="highlight">children</span>, and the religions have been quick to exploit these fertile fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have built up a code of religious, moral and ethical standards surrounding sex, marriage and the upbringing of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has developed over many centuries and it is based on security for mothers, particularly during their child bearing period and all the nuances that go with it, and on providing care for the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Husbands criticise wives and vice versa, <span class="highlight">children</span> criticise parents and vice versa and neighbours criticise friends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When it comes to the custody of <span class="highlight">children</span> there is no problem at all because the state looks after them anyway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They want to know about educational opportunities both for <span class="highlight">children</span> and adults, and also investment although I think that if this Government keeps going the way it has been much longer they will not need much instruction in investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the tragedies in divorce is the fact that <span class="highlight">children</span> are often involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is bad enough for couples who have no <span class="highlight">children</span> to become completely incompatible and finally to be divorced, but it is an absolute tragedy when <span class="highlight">children</span> are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is bad enough that the mature couple- the parents- are involved in such a situation but it is a tragedy when <span class="highlight">children</span> are involved in such an environment when they could have so much more out of their early lives if they had had the benefit of a happy home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>More importantly, I support the no-fault aspect because the dragging out publicly of the mire and dirty linen affects young <span class="highlight">children</span> who are going to school where everybody knows everybody’s business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do not want to happen in this country things such as  Senator Sheil  has described in relation to China where, if the whole system of marriage has broken down completely, the <span class="highlight">children</span> are taken away and kept in an institution so that the mother can go back to work because she has to do a good deal more than half the work to let the menfolk fight in the services and suchlike. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Weaken respect for marriage, regard it as easily and opportunistically dissolvable, remove the lawful backing for the mutuality of obligations and promote the independence or separateness of the parties to the marriage and their <span class="highlight">children</span> and I believe that we are threatening the institution of the family and its stabilising influence in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They affect not only the grounds for divorce but also a host of other facets of the marriage relationship; the court structure in quite fundamental ways; provisions relating to the welfare and custody of <span class="highlight">children</span> in ways which have not been part of our law in the past; provisions relating to maintenance and property which alter long established concepts, and procedures and so on which introduce many new ideas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee is of the opinion that the establishment of such a Court is an essential supplement to the change from a concept of ‘fault’ in divorce grounds to one of irretrievable breakdown evidenced by separation and that the ultimate well-being of all involved in ‘family ‘ differences, including <span class="highlight">children</span>, will be fostered by such a judicial institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is the core of a matrimonial cause and anything relating to that- relating to property, maintenance or <span class="highlight">children</span>- represents a matrimonial cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They include, for example, the right of a wife to receive weekly payments of maintenance moneys, the right of a father to visit his <span class="highlight">children</span> in the custody of their mother and the right of a wife to a portion of the property held by her husband. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A proceeding by a wife against a husband for a settlement of his property upon herself and the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the marriage might be regarded as a matrimonial cause in a wide sense but in s. 51 (xxii.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A third example, of course, is the ordinary- what I will call the State Maintenance Act, as at present- proceeding in respect of maintenance for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why are such <span class="highlight">children</span>- I gather there has been some increase, as I understand it, in the number of <span class="highlight">children</span> who fall within these categoriesexcluded from the purview of a court which may wish to make an order under these provisions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These <span class="highlight">children</span>, after all, are, under the law of the State, wards of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that the court ought to have the power to do this but because these <span class="highlight">children</span> are under the care and control of Ministers of State and so on it is said that there are special circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That type of organisation is finding that it needs to provide emergency accommodation for <span class="highlight">children</span> whose parents are temporarily unable to cope for them and because they incur costs in minding these <span class="highlight">children</span> they are in financial difficulties and as the work that it does prevents the <span class="highlight">children</span> from becoming wards of the State the Bureau is ineligible for Government help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where the court makes an order or grants an injunction under section 90 which has the effect, either directly or indirectly, of requiring the parties to a marriage to live separately and apart, the court shall, if it is of opinion that it is in the interests of the parties or of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the marriage to do so, direct either or both of the parties to attend upon a marriage counsellor, but failure to comply with such a direction does not constitute a contempt of the court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seemed to me that as the sub-clause stood originally, when an order was made under clause 90 and that order required the parties to separate because it was, in the judgment of the court, proper that that be done, if the court felt that it was in the interests of the parties or of the <span class="highlight">children</span> it could say: ‘You must go before a marriage counsellor’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand the provision, the court shall, if it is of opinion that it is in the interests of the parties or of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the marriage to do so, direct either or both of the parties to attend upon a marriage counsellor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The court will exercise that discretion only if it believes that it is in the interests of the parties or of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the marriage to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the amendment were accepted the clause would read:   the court shall, if it is of opinion that it is in the interests of the parties or of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the marriage to do so, advise . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is proper at that time for the court to say: ‘Well, bitterness now exists between the parties and I feel that you have got to do something to look after, for example, the <span class="highlight">children</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if something can be done to look after the interests of the <span class="highlight">children</span> I think it should be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The relevant parts of the clause will now read:   the court shall, if it is of opinion that it is in the interests of the parties or of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the marriage to do so, direct or advise either or both of the parties to attend upon a marriage counsellor, but failure to comply with such direction or advice does not constitute a contempt of the court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that step is taken the judge is going to direct that the parties attend before a marriage counsellor only if he is of the opinion that it is in the interests of the parties themselves, or of the <span class="highlight">children</span>, that they should do so, or that either of them should do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that be the type of injunction which the legislation will empower a judge to make, I believe that if the judge, in the exercise of that same discretion, compels persons, in the interests of the <span class="highlight">children</span>, to go before a marriage guidance counsellor, the person to whom that direction is given ought to obey the direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be in the interests of that person’s wife that he be separated from her; it may be in the interests of the <span class="highlight">children</span> that he have some consultations to see what is in their best interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of the Committee to clause 41 of the Bill which deals with the <span class="highlight">children</span> and which contains provisions relating to conferences where the interests of the <span class="highlight">children</span> are concerned, where there is a child under eighteen and where divorce proceedings or proceedings for custody or guardianship have been instituted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was also a provision that the failure does not constitute a contempt of the court but the proposal was to remove those words from there where the interests of the <span class="highlight">children</span> were involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Where <span class="highlight">children</span> are involved and something is affecting the interests of the <span class="highlight">children</span> the court may, if it sees lit, direct the parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that if we leave the clause as amended it would be better than endeavouring to bring in this aspect of compulsion because where <span class="highlight">children</span> are concerned there seems to be quite ample provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Turning to the other areas referred to, it is really only a question of dealing with those who fall outside the concept of marriage, that is, the illegitimate or ex-nuptial <span class="highlight">children</span> and the matters which concern them in the area of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Simply because one of the parties, who have married and have taken the solemn vows, decides that he or she does not want to go on with it and wants a separation, under this provision of the Bill he or she will have the right to the dissolution of the marriage and to all that stems from it, such as maintenance and custody of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my experience as a practitioner in this field- although it is some years ago now- the immediate concern of people who come to a lawyer is protection, maintenance and custody of the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, if there are still <span class="highlight">children</span> they want maintenance for the <span class="highlight">children</span> and for themselves and custody of the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendment provides that the period shall be 12 months if the <span class="highlight">children</span> are above the age of 18 years and 3 years if the <span class="highlight">children</span> are under the age of 18 years unless one of the fault grounds which now appear in the Matrimonial Causes Act- and there are 14 of them defined in it clearly- is proved against the respondent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take that to mean the law will provide such impediments to easy divorce as will cause people, both before they have entered into marriage and after they have entered into it, to have very serious regard to the nature of the responsibilities they are assuming, not only to their <span class="highlight">children</span> but also to each other and indeed to society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, a taxpayer with a wife and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>, with a taxable income of $2,732, after allowance of dependants and other deductions will be freed from tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The tax payable by a taxpayer with a taxable income of $4,000, after deductions for a wife and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>, will be $303.52 for 1974-75, compared with $608.30 for 1973-74-a reduction of over 50 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the parents to benefit most relatively from educational income tax deductions, in the past and even more in the future, are the parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> in government schools and this has a divisive effect in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the serious allegation and the extension of torture to young <span class="highlight">children</span>, will the Leader of the Government raise this inhuman and fiendish development with the Prime Minister and ask him to protest on behalf of the Australian Government to General Binochet against the torture and murder of political prisoners in Chile? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think everyone would deplore the use of torture especially the torture of young <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One factor which has strongly influenced me in exercising my judgment in favour of a 12-month period is simply that we are dealing with a situation of marital breakdown in which 2 parties are involved and in which frequently <span class="highlight">children</span> also are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is most desirable that we do everything that we can, even though the formal structure of a marriage has gone, to ensure that as far as possible there is an on-going relationship between those 2 people as human beings and that we should do nothing in this legislation which is likely in any way to disrupt and fracture the possibility of some permanent on-going relationship between the parties, particularly where <span class="highlight">children</span> are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me very strongly that if there is added to the established period of 12 months separation another period of 6 months, 12 months or whatever one likes, it is in that extra period that most likely there will develop between the parties friction and tension which are adverse to any relationship which they might have though divorced and, more particularly, adverse to the future of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of that marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is to say, if we prolong a situation in limbo too much we will very adversely affect the possibility, of a viable situation developing between that father and that mother if there are <span class="highlight">children</span> or between that husband and that wife if it is a marriage without <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point is that under a subsequent clause of the Bill- clause 42- it is provided that a decree nisi cannot become absolute unless the court is satisfied in relation to the <span class="highlight">children</span> in the terms of clause 42. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further- this is the result of the recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs -if the court is in doubt as to whether proper arrangments have been made in relation to the <span class="highlight">children</span>, it may adjourn the proceedings until a report regarding those arrangements has been obtained from a welfare officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem to me that in some cases there would be further opportunity for recriminations and for difficulties to arise, especially in relation to <span class="highlight">children</span>; that the general moral public interest would not be enhanced by a longer period of the parties being legally married but being de facto not married; and that when one looked at the balance of public interest and public convenience then, admittedly in an arbitrary situation, a period of 12 months was an appropriate period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In regard to my amendment, I give the example where some service is performed by either party such as in the case mentioned earlier by  Senator James  McClelland in which the wife cooked the Christmas dinner, no doubt in the interests of the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may have been done for the sake of the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The occasion may involve a visit to the <span class="highlight">children</span> on Christmas day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think that it is absolutely absurd where people are living in a three or four roomed house and we want to establish a proper ground for divorce- that is what we are concerned about- to say that they can be regarded as separate and living apart if they still continue to live in a three or four roomed house, particularly when they are jointly caring for the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that there are no <span class="highlight">children</span> of the marriage who have not attained the age of 1 8 years; or <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the only <span class="highlight">children</span> of the marriage who have not attained the age of 18 years are the <span class="highlight">children</span> specified in the order and that- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>proper arrangements in all the circumstances have been made for the welfare of those <span class="highlight">children</span>; or <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This clause relates to the matters to be taken into consideration in proceedings with respect to the maintenance of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the concluding part of the provision with regard to maintenance for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When people turn 18 they are adults, not <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provision for such circumstances, and <span class="highlight">children</span> who go through university or undertake other training and so forth will need it, should be made in other areas of the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is quite absurd to use the family law in this regard, particularly that aspect of it directed to maintenance of <span class="highlight">children</span>, to deal with the position of an adult who happens to need maintenance while undergoing education or some kind of training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I indicate that I think this amendment is not in the spirit of what we ought to be providing in respect of maintenance of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>She may be keeping <span class="highlight">children</span> in private schools and in circumstances upon which the first husband insists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sort of situation which the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs had in mind was one where a man of some means- I am not talking about a man who won the lottery or about a millionaire; I am talking about a man of some means- obtained a divorce after one year’s separation from a wife who may have been entirely unwilling to agree to the divorce but who, because of this law, has been divorced and she was clearly entitled to maintenance, and substantial maintenance, for herself and the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the marriage and obtained such an order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 55 (3), which we mentioned some little time ago, deals with the maintenance of <span class="highlight">children</span> and says that a court may continue an order beyond 18 years of age for the maintenance of a child where it is considered necessary to complete his education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>maintenance agreements and of agreements for maintenance of ex-nuptial <span class="highlight">children</span> for the purpose of securing the enforcement of those agreements in those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In sub-clause (1) in the definition of ‘matrimonial cause’ paragraph (c) (iii), leave out ‘<span class="highlight">children</span> ofthe marriage’ and insert ‘ a child of a marriage ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What does the Minister hope will evolve from this conference in the shape of benefits for the school <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could this facility be used for transferring educational material to video cassettes for use in teaching isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note also that the Aged Persons Hostels Bill and the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Bill, as well as being companion Bills, are also related to the Sheltered Employment (Assistance) Act and the Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span> (Assistance) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The order which conducted this institution was of the opinion that it was of very great benefit for the elderly people to be in close contact with these young <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill, which repeals the Sheltered Employment (Assistance) Act and the Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span> (Assistance) Act, consolidates and extends the Australian Government’s programs of assistance to voluntary organisations that have assumed responsibility for the welfare of handicapped people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Sheltered Employment (Assistance) Act has been in operation for more than 7 years and the Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span> (Assistance) Act for more than 4 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Sheltered Employment (Assistance) Act and the Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span> (Assistance) Act will be repealed the main provisions of those 2 Acts are continued and expanded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is designed to cater for the needs of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> and handicapped adults who do not require constant medical attention but who, nevertheless, need special facilities to enable them to take thenplace in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The subsidy for establishing sheltered workshops for handicapped adults, training centres for handicapped childen and hostels for both <span class="highlight">children</span> and adults will be doubled from $2 to $4 for every $1 raised by voluntary organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also transfers the provisions relating to the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s benefit which is now administered by the Department of Social Security, from the National Health Act to this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It caters for physically and mentally handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> and adults most of whom require assistance by way of training, supervision, employment or accommodation if their lives are not to be wasted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will also be necessary to ensure that the assistance provided for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> is coordinated with the activities of the Schools Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently the Government, the Minister and his Department have been quite happy to see the affairs which have been referred to in the report of a parliamentary committee concerning the situation of <span class="highlight">children</span> in particular at Yirrkala continue for the 2 years in which the Australian Labor Party has been in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak particularly of people who have mentioned <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A good deal of work is being done by the Australian <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Television Action Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot accept the premise, however, that if these amendments proposed by the Government are not passed <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs will be in jeopardy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see this as a matter of consultation, co-operation and forward thinking in the planning that needs to be undertaken in the future to ensure that the excellence and quality of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programming is developed as we believe it should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite the attention of the House especially to the latter provisions because ever since there has been talk of the introduction of television into Australia, genuine fear has been expressed by large sections of the community that the introduction of television would have unfortunate effects on some sections of the population, particularly on <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Guilfoyle also dismissed, I thought somewhat ungraciously, the attitude of the Australian <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Television Action Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Society has recognised that its most precious resource is its <span class="highlight">children</span> and that it has a responsibility for undertaking a positive program of environment directed to meet the particular needs and interests of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is more than sufficient evidence to show that television plays a large part in the lives and development of Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>, that the entertainment programs provided now and any time during the 18 years of Australian television have not, except in rare and isolated cases, been of a quality to advantageously influence <span class="highlight">children</span>’s development in any area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span> are not only continually exploited by seductive and misleading advertising, but are bombarded with a massive amount of violence which increasing amounts of research show to be detrimental to a child ‘s mental health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like, I am sure, other honourable senators I have been inundated by requests to oppose these amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act on behalf of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australia because of the standard of the program it has been said will be foisted on them if the Bill is passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Australian people feel and have felt for a long time that the Broadcasting Control Board has a responsibility to determine what are to be regarded as <span class="highlight">children</span>’s viewing programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I consider that the Australian people want to ensure that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board has the power to determine what type of advertising should be allowed, for instance, during <span class="highlight">children</span>’s viewing time and during family viewing time and so on, and that they believe there is a responsibility on the Board to determine how much programming should be of Australian origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Henceforth when I get letters of complaint about the time slotting of particular programs on <span class="highlight">children</span>’s viewing time or in family viewing time, complaints about excessive advertising on television or the type of advertising on television during <span class="highlight">children</span>’s viewing hours I will be able to say that because of the Opposition in this Senate the Control Board has no power to act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was found that the station was behind in meeting the requirements of 4-hour school age <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs, and in approving the renewal of the licence I directed the Control Board to draw this matter to the attention of the station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to say that the Minister had directed that the company, as licensee, be reprimanded for its failure to meet the 4-hour school age <span class="highlight">children</span>’s program requirement in the first period of the current statistical year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We note that in the same letter you said that in’ renewing the licence for TCN the Minister had directed that our company, as licensee, be reprimanded for its failure to meet the Four Hour School-Age <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s program requirements in the first period of the current statistical year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We of the Opposition were interested to note that this Bill, which repeals the Sheltered Employment (Assistance) Act and the Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span> (Assistance) Act, consolidates and extends the Australian Government’s programs of assistance to voluntary organisations that have assumed responsibility for the welfare of handicapped people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have one question with regard to the repeal of the Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span> (Assistance) Act to which I would like a response from the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation  (Senator Wheeldon). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In clause 35 of the Bill with which we are dealing tonight there is provision for repeal of the Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span> (Assistance) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The original Act for the care of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> gave a great deal of help to that sector of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span> (Assistance) Act, which has been repealed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are interested in the educational programs that were able to be developed and that were related to the needs of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to sheltered employment assistance, we are interested to see that the subsidy for the establishing of sheltered workshops for handicapped adults and training centres for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> in hostels for both <span class="highlight">children</span> and adults will now be $4 for every $1 which is raised by the voluntary organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have pleasure in giving a speedy passage to this Bill, and we look forward to further extensions of both sheltered workshop employment opportunities and facilities for the training of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Guilfoyle has outlined the functions of the Bill and has pointed out how the Bill repeals the Sheltered Employment Assistance Act and the Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Assistance Act and replaces them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the tendency we have had in the past in all the States to draw a rigid line at the age of 16 yearsbetween the time when persons can be accommodated in a home for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> and after the age of 16 years when they must be accommodated in a home for handicapped adults, if such homes exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite recently I came across a disturbing case of a 16-year-old boy who was working in a sheltered workshop in a capital city, who was accommodated in a hostel that was suitable for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>- not severely handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>- who turned 16 and who because of various circumstances could not go home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was the fault of the whole system because we have not provided accommodation for these people in the grey area who are no longer <span class="highlight">children</span> but perhaps not yet adults. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that this rigidity of approach must give way to a flexibility in which accommodation, ranging from almost the hospital type to hostels, flats and bed sitters, must be provided for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She referred to the two Acts which are to be repealed by the Bill now before us, namely the Sheltered Employment Assistance Act and the Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Assistance Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Specifically referring to the Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Assistance Act about which she asked her question, one will find that a greater measure of assistance will be made available to voluntary and other organisations which provide assistance for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The direction was reviewed on 1 3 February 1 973 when it was liberalised to enable consideration to be given to the provision of an additional loan for an extra bedroom where, because of a big disparity in ages of <span class="highlight">children</span> or for medical reasons, it is undesirable for two <span class="highlight">children</span> of the same sex to occupy the same bedroom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-66-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Five Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> were admitted to the Broken Hill Hospital last week but the doctor said that the pathology tests showed that they had measles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be of benefit to any person in immediate need: To the permanently homeless, to the deserted or disturbed woman and her <span class="highlight">children</span>, to the Aboriginal or teenager in want or distress, to the battered woman or the battered child, to the single parent- in short, to anyone without support or an income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to assist eligible organisations engaged in providing temporary accommodation and personal services for homeless men and women and, in one-parent family situations, their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are also a number of provisions in the Bill to effect machinery amendments to the National Health Act to delete provisions relating to the payment of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s benefits, to clarify the provisions regarding directions by the Minister under section 73  b  and to enable provisions in the National Health Act relating to the supervision of registered organisations to override State laws where the statutes are inconsistent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At present the number of friendly society dispensaries with full approval to dispense benefits to the public has been taken up in both Queensland and South Australia and there are currently 7 dispensaries in Queensland and 5 in South Australia which have only a limited approval to dispense benefits to members of the society, their wives and dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> under the age of 16 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill further provides that full-time student dependants of members, up to the maximum age provided for in the rules of the friendly societies concerned, be afforded the same benefits as parent members and <span class="highlight">children</span> under the age of 1 6 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The development of Monarto, the development of Albury-Wodonga, the appropriation of the Glebe lands for redevelopment in an imaginative way, the proposed appropriation of 90 acres of land at Woolloomooloo for new development in an imaginative way, the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate, which for the first time has established criteria about the essential heritage of this nation and the sort of things of which, when the petty issues of today are gone, Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> of the future can be proud, including the vital heritage of the environment, the landscape and the buildings which are so important in the building of a national tradition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Liberal Government in Victoria has never really seen the needs which exist for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of that State in education, particularly the needs of disadvantaged <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At end of motion, add-  but the Senate is of the opinion that the provisions of the Bill which reduce the limit on deductions for education expenses from $400 to $150 seriously restrict the freedom of choice which now exists in the Australian education system, are a contravention of the Government’s election undertakings and will impose unwarranted burdens on parents with <span class="highlight">children</span> attending both public and private schools and, further, that the Bill specifically: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to violence in <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs, the number of advertisements that are shown in <span class="highlight">children</span>’s viewing time, what programs should be shown in <span class="highlight">children</span>’s viewing time, family viewing time, or adult viewing time and the Board’s powers generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a person who was educated, and is proud to say so, in state schools, and as a parent who sent his <span class="highlight">children</span> to state primary schools, I emphatically applaud the work that is done by state school education authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Having been an active member of parents and citizens associations, I understand the problems of the parent in ordinary average income families in sending his or her <span class="highlight">children</span> to state schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any person who sends his or her <span class="highlight">children</span> to a state school today will incur expenditure of substantially more than $150 a year in education expenses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he seriously say- and this is importantthat in the year 1974, and prospectively next year, the average cost to a parent of state school <span class="highlight">children</span> will be $ 1 50 or less? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be a right for people who are not affluent, who have not got the kind of earnings that are necessary to pay large fees, to pay $1,000 a year or more for their <span class="highlight">children</span>’s education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a quaint thing it is that those who attack the independent schools and who stand up here talking as they do about these things send their own <span class="highlight">children</span> to independent schools and, if I may say so by interpolation, come along to Liberals and ask their help to get their <span class="highlight">children</span> into those schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that those people who send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to independent schools will now have to pay substantially more in 2 waysbecause of inflation in fees and because of the reduction in the tax allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At end of motion, add-  but the Senate is of the opinion that the provisions of the Bill which reduce the limit on deductions for education expenses from $400 to $150 seriously restrict the freedom of choice which now exists in the Australian education system, are a contravention of the Government’s election undertakings and will impose unwarranted burdens on parents with <span class="highlight">children</span> attending both public and private schools and. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one of those who live in a provincial city I know what takes place in the provincial towns and country areas in my State of Queensland- no doubt the same takes place in other States as well- when people take the opportunity of sending their <span class="highlight">children</span> to the major schools which are very often to be found in the capital cities and, in the case of Queensland, mostly in the southern centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The desire of those people is to give their <span class="highlight">children</span> what they think is a good education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have always felt that the giving of a taxation concession to individuals who send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to such schools is more in keeping with my line of thinking about keeping the private schools going than the provision of straight out subsidies by the Government, which has never been to my liking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such individuals are getting a concession because they are trying to give their <span class="highlight">children</span> a better education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks around country centres one can visualise that there is not the opportunity in those areas to give <span class="highlight">children</span> higher education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the great distances in States like my own that people have to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> if they are to get such an education and because of the cost of keeping their <span class="highlight">children</span> at such schools, surely to goodness those people are entitled to some concession for giving their <span class="highlight">children</span> the opportunity of obtaining a good standard of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that the Government has shown itself to be really miserly towards the people from country areas who desire to educate their <span class="highlight">children</span> to a high standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people should be commended and encouraged by the Government because of their desire to give their <span class="highlight">children</span> a higher education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said before, I think that the Government’s action in cheeseparing to the disadvantage of worthwhile citizens who send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to schools in order for them to have a higher standard of education, indicates just how mean it has become in relation to certain very important aspects of the development of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the spectacle of many people who live 50 or 60 miles from town having to run 2 homes- one in a village with a high school so that they can send their <span class="highlight">children</span> for secondary education, and their other home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Similarly, thieving of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> goes on in other parts of Queensland under the so-called protection of the State Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where are the starving <span class="highlight">children</span>, the riots, the demonstrations and the staff walking off the communities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether he has read the scathing report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs concerning his own Yirrkala people and their starving <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet this dauntless disciple of racial discrimination, with his Department divided, his radicals ridiculing him and the <span class="highlight">children</span> under his care starving, presumes to discredit Queensland’s Aborigines and Islanders, the Queensland legislation and the Queensland Premier with a Bill that is nothing more than deceit and duplicity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I look upon this question as one which will cause great expense to people to educate their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It could possibly mean that some of them will have to forgo education that they have in mind for their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Government does appreciate the difficulties faced by people living in remote areas and has accepted responsibility for improving educational opportunities for <span class="highlight">children</span> whose families live in isolated areas far removed from normal school facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of this Government’s first initiatives was to introduce the isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>’s scheme of financial assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, there has been no confusion about the Opposition’s attitude to this Bill because the attitude was made clear in the other place when it moved as an amendment that the following words be added to the motion that the Bill be read a second time:  whilst not opposing the positive sections of the Bill which relate to nursing homes, handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> and surgical appliances, this House is of the opinion that the Bill should be withdrawn and redrafted - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a proposal which will lead to control by the Minister for Social Security over the health insurance funds in this country; there is a proposal which will increase the subsidies for nursing homes; there are proposals which will correct anomalies with regard to handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s payments 9nd which will widen the provision with respect to surgical aids and medical aids and applicances; and there is a proposal which provides for an extension of full approval rights for certain friendly society dispensaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to reiterate the support that was given in the other place by the Opposition spokesman on this subject with regard to the nursing home and handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> ‘s payment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the beneficiary is entitled to full cover for himself, but has a wife or <span class="highlight">children</span>, he will be entitled to relief from onehalf of the levy that would otherwise be payable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure if he considered people, particularly those in the country areas, whose student <span class="highlight">children</span> will be affected by this Bill, if it is amended, he would agree that he ought to be looking after the interests of these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Northern Development and the Northern Territory been drawn to newspaper reports that the women of Darwin are pressing for a bigger say in the reconstruction of the city because the old city had ample resources for male leisure and recreation but little for women and <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Increasingly, a citizen’s real standard of living, the health of himself and his family, his <span class="highlight">children</span>’s opportunities for education and self-improvement, his access to employment opportunities, his ability to enjoy the nation’s resources for recreation and culture, his ability to participate in the decisions and actions of the community are determined not by his income, not by the hours he works, but by where he lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of this child care scheme is to make financial assistance available to certain types of non-profit organisations and local governing bodies for the establishment and operation of child care centres, primarily for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of working or sick parents or of parents who are otherwise unable to care for them during the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I say, this is the case in the area of the arts and artistic expression, the preservation of the national estate, the preservation of areas of historic interest, in looking after the aged and the sick, in caring for <span class="highlight">children</span>, including disadvantaged <span class="highlight">children</span> and handicapped people, the provision of special assistance grants for roads, in taking over national highways to free for State authorities more funds with which to carry out work on secondary roads, country roads and other areas of road responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I did see the report, which I think was in the ‘Daily Telegraph’, that the young <span class="highlight">children</span> were apparently influenced by a television commercial which featured a person indiscriminately lighting matches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Board decided that the advertisement should not be shown before 8.30 p.m. At the time that it was monitored, as I understand it, the advertisement was being shown in what is regarded as <span class="highlight">children</span> ‘s viewing time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I consider that the campaign being waged by the New South Wales Government against the New South Wales Teachers Federation and its members is likely to be detrimental to school <span class="highlight">children</span> in that State, and this action follows the action by the New South Wales Government in recently refusing the inclusion of the preference clause in the latest teachers award. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am informed that the Camperdown and Prince Henry hospitals in New South Wales and the Royal <span class="highlight">Children</span> ‘s and Fairfield hospitals in Victoria are admirably suited for this purpose and are being used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The action which has attracted most attention is of course the bringing of <span class="highlight">children</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this matter, the sole role of the Australian Government was to bring eligible <span class="highlight">children</span> to suitable adoptive families as promptly and as safely as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian Government authorities found that many of the <span class="highlight">children</span> evacuated from Saigon were the subject of uncompleted off-shore adoption procedures in South Vietnam by Australian nationals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Faced with this fact, my Government determined that it could do nothing in the matter of allocating <span class="highlight">children</span> to families as this was clearly a State responsibility and therefore if there was to be any disagreement between adoptive families about the <span class="highlight">children</span> then it was a matter for the States to determine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can the Australian Government be sure that these <span class="highlight">children</span> are adopted by suitable parents? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The actual adoption of <span class="highlight">children</span> within Australia is not a function of the Federal Government; it is a function of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The applications by the prospective parents to adopt <span class="highlight">children</span> are dealt with by the appropriate State courts, and there is really nothing that we can do about that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">children</span> may be granted visas to enter Australia, whether they are coming from South Vietnam or from anywhere else, but in this case, we are particularly concerned with the situation in South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other <span class="highlight">children</span> may be granted visas- these are the particular ones to whom  Senator Primmer  would be referring- to join prospective adoptive parents in Australia where the adoption proposals have the support of the relevant child welfare authorities, which in these cases would be the various departments of community welfare and child welfare in the different States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After entering Australia <span class="highlight">children</span> who have not been lawfully adopted are immigrant <span class="highlight">children</span> and as such are dealt with under the provisions of the Immigration (Guardianship of <span class="highlight">Children</span>) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the particular case of the 2 1 5 <span class="highlight">children</span> who arrived from Vietnam on Saturday last, the normal formalities had not been completed at the time of their arrival. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a number of cases the formalities had already been commenced and <span class="highlight">children</span> allocated to proposed adoptive parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Others have not been allocated to specific parents and ultimately will be allocated, if one can use the rather inhuman word ‘allocated’ in regard to <span class="highlight">children</span>, to the various States which no doubt will make appropriate arrangements through the different child welfare organisations within those States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until these allocations have been made the <span class="highlight">children</span> are not being issued with entry permits and consequently are remaining under the control of the Minister for Labor and Immigration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When entry permits are issued the <span class="highlight">children</span> will legally become wards of the Minister for Social Security, but in practice his powers and functions will be undertaken by the State child welfare departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There will be difficulties in identifying all of the <span class="highlight">children</span> who have arrived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some 100 <span class="highlight">children</span> still have not been allocated to the various States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter is being dealt with within the terms of the Immigration (Guardianship of <span class="highlight">Children</span> ) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We expect that the problems of documentation and identification, which 1 think of necessity occurred in view of the very rushed way in which the previous flight had to be handled, will be avoided if there are any subsequent flights bringing immigrant <span class="highlight">children</span> from Vietnam into Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have thought that the Opposition, instead of moving a facile motion, could have shown that it had some conscience about the damage it assisted to do to the country by showing some real concern for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of that country and ensuring that everything possible was done to make sure that they were reunited with whatever remnants of their families were left. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If maximum benefit is to be gained from these expenditures, and if the innate talents of our <span class="highlight">children</span> are to be developed to meet the calls of society in the present and in the future- then proper arrangements for the continuous review and development of the materials and methods of teaching and learning in schools are essential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would be interested to hear the Country Party’s comments on that proposition advanced by a former Leader of the Opposition that education grants for isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> should be reduced and likewise on the proposition that funds for the States and for rural roads would be reduced and presumably that the price support for the wool industry would be liquidated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one woman went to be retrained, the person interviewing her asked whether it was fair that she be retrained as she may have more <span class="highlight">children</span> and in that case the skills she acquired would not be used by the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The principal features of this Bill are substantial increases in the basic rates of pensions and benefits, an increase in additional payments for <span class="highlight">children</span>, implementation of the second step in the Government’s program to abolish the means test on age pensions, provision for the payment of unemployment, sickness and special benefit weekly in advance instead of weekly in arrear and provision for the immediate payment of special benefit to persons newly discharged from gaol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that the circular letter from the Broadcasting Control Board states that advertisements for those personal products may be broadcast and televised at times when the audience is not likely to contain a large proportion of <span class="highlight">children</span> and young persons? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We realise that winter is approaching and that because of the geographical situation of the southern part of Tasmania people there are now finding that they and their <span class="highlight">children</span> must get up in the dark, must leave for work or school very early in the morning when it is barely daylight and must return home in similar conditions at the end of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One does not have to talk to many migrants or many Aborigines to appreciate how much they react to the attitude that exists amongst so many of the Australian people, to realise the alienation and confusion felt by the <span class="highlight">children</span> of migrants in our schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 19 September 1974 I tabled in this House a statement in which I announced the Government’s decision to establish a <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s firm intention is to provide an imaginative and comprehensive range of services so that all <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia will have access to services that are designed to promote their well-being, to enhance the quality of life and to promote equality of opportunity for them and their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To do this I expect that the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission will work in cooperation with appropriate government and community organisations and will call upon the expertise and involvement of all relevant sections of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In moving to establish the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission the Australian Government has recognised that changing social patterns have put considerable pressures on families with infant and school-age <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These changes include a growing number of families where both parents work, and of single parent families, as well as a frequently increasing sense of isolation affecting women looking after <span class="highlight">children</span> at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission the Australian Government will provide assistance to a variety of organisations, groups and individuals for programs including full day care, family day care, pre-school education, emergency care, occasional care, before and after school and vacation care, playgroups and any other child care activities in accordance with demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first emphasis of our childhood services program will be in areas of particular need, with priority going to provide services for <span class="highlight">children</span> of working, single, sick or other parents who are unable to care for their <span class="highlight">children</span> during the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Priority will also be given to families in economic or other distress, and to groups with particular needs such as Aborigines, migrants, handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> and isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where a service is sponsored by a Government body, representatives of the community, and of the parents whose <span class="highlight">children</span> use the service, should be actively encouraged to participate in planning, managing and conducting it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many options available which would enable many more <span class="highlight">children</span> to participate in services in those facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must get away from the idea that bricks and mortar can provide the answer to caring for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And the answer is in people who know how to look after <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must not be one-eyed when we consider the differing requirements for looking after <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The functions of the Commission set out in clause 5 of the Bill embody the philosophy of providing comprehensive, co-ordinated and integrated services for <span class="highlight">children</span> and include the concept of providing priority to those in greatest need, special needs of particular groups and flexibility in the provision of services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill will ensure that what we are already doing in the provision of services for <span class="highlight">children</span> will be the subject of continuing parliamentary scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been carefully drafted to meet the needs of Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> and their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure honourable senators will wish to see the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission established to continue the work started by the interim committee and develop programs which will make Australia a forerunner in the provision of an extensive network of integrated and meaningful services for our <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is carried to its logical conclusion, I would assume that only those people who have <span class="highlight">children</span> at educational institutions should be paying for educational facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span> lose a lot of time from school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said that, I say that I discussed the matter with the Assistant General Manager (Radio) of the ABC,  Mr McKriell  and I have been told that the Commission has decided that the Ralph Collins ‘Sunday Morning Concert’ should be replaced by a program for <span class="highlight">children</span>, because the Commission had been concerned for some time at the lack of support for its week-day <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A newly designed <span class="highlight">children</span> ‘s program was therefore scheduled for Sunday morning at a time at which it would be more convenient for young people to listen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Experience in Australia and overseas has demonstrated the benefits that can accrue to <span class="highlight">children</span> and their schools from the concentration of relatively large funds and other resources on curriculum development ona national scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was stated then that the task of the Curriculum Development Centre is seen as being concerned with its development in such areas as resources, sequencing or learning activities, teacher-pupil interaction, organisation of the learning situation and the teachers general approach to <span class="highlight">children</span> and teaching. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose it would be expected that in this year I would say something about the curricula that can be developed in Australia for the future of our <span class="highlight">children</span> so that they are not moulded into the traditional roles- the sexist roles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since we have stopped, in most of our state schools and private schools, steering <span class="highlight">children</span> rigidly into a sort of academic and technical type school in 2 streams, since we have stopped putting <span class="highlight">children</span> into these streams and giving them little hope of getting from one to the other, I think the lack of curriculum development and curriculum assessment in many schools and in many systems has left the non-academic child, the child who is not going on to matriculation, the child who is not going on to university, in a sort of educational no-man’s land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many <span class="highlight">children</span>- I think it applies to most <span class="highlight">children</span>- who for reasons of intellect, environment and psychological and other reasons do not proceed to matriculation, colleges of advanced education or to university level, are left doing courses which in some States and in some schools are merely watered down versions of the academic level courses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has left <span class="highlight">children</span> doing watered down versions of academic courses- the same subjects but at what is considered to be a slightly lower level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that teachers recognise this; <span class="highlight">children</span> certainly recognise it; parents recognise it, but to me authorities do not recognise it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that provided the Centre is retained with this flexible approach, provided that it does not become a rigid conformist centre of propaganda to produce curricula that every child in the country must swallow daily in large doses, it can develop useful and very important concepts in the education of our <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it can take one small step towards changing the rigid approach to education that some of us knew, and perhaps few of us overcame, it will do more for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of this country than many similar provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it is only in the belief that the establishment of such a centre will have beneficial effects upon <span class="highlight">children</span> at school that the Government can justify the creation of such a centre or its continued funding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we have an example of the headmaster,  Mr Harold  Goodwin, being able to develop a program which is locally relevant and which has involved the <span class="highlight">children</span> of that school in a whole series of exercises which they are embracing enthusiastically, which mean something to them and which are being related to a number of activities in the area in which the school is situated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The thing the Centre will do which the States cannot do is foster national projects which will benefit <span class="highlight">children</span> in all States and in all schools throughout the whole nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their ideas and thoughts will be conveyed to my colleague the Minister for Education and they will be taken into consideration because, after all, education is of vital concern to all Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> and to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has been drawn to my attention that the salary range for the  Chairman  of this Commission is lower than that for the  Chairman  of the Schools Commission, the  Chairman  of the Universities Commission, the  Chairman  of the Colleges of Advanced Education Commission; indeed I understand it is in a lower range than that proposed for the  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Children</span> ‘s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already spoken of the importance of ethnic identification for many <span class="highlight">children</span> caught in the no man’s land of ambivalence between their home environment and that of their school still geared to the  assimilationists  ‘ goal of Angloconformity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She could not communicate with other <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matter on which she sought advice was an application to have her family of 6 <span class="highlight">children</span> declared neglected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, I fought the easiest case of my life, and the charge that the <span class="highlight">children</span> be declared neglected was dismissed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of the non-defence of that charge would, of course, have been that the <span class="highlight">children</span> would have been found neglected and would have been committed to institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 6 <span class="highlight">children</span> would have been institutionalised as part of a program of moving Aborigines out of East Perth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While I do not think it will change those of us who have passed the great divide of 30 years of age, I think it might succeed in changing the attitude of our <span class="highlight">children</span>, in the case of some of us here, our grandchildren and subsequent generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the father leaves to go walkabout he knows full well that the women and <span class="highlight">children</span> will be looked after by the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We might think that someone is not good enough to live with us or not good enough for our <span class="highlight">children</span> to marry, but we should not say that we have a better standard and we should not say that we should not show toleration to those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Such an attitude is born into us; it is taught to us as <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the fact that there are no Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television programs on commercial television between 4 p.m. and 6.30 p.m., when the majority of viewers are <span class="highlight">children</span>, would the Minister encourage the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to use its powers to initiate a public hearing on the question of Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television programs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is a fact that no Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television programs are being shown by commercial television between 4.30 p.m. and 6.30 p.m.- in <span class="highlight">children</span>’s viewing time- I personally deprecate that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At my direction research is continuing within my own department and material is being collected for the preparation of a positions paper concerning <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programming on television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole spectrum of programming for <span class="highlight">children</span> is being examined, in addition to the available programs that are not shown locally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Realising the tremendous amount of loneliness in a large number of migrant families, especially womenfolk who are at home for most or all of the day by themselves while their husbands are at work and their <span class="highlight">children</span> are at school, I and the Government for some time have been keen to establish a form of ethnic broadcasting to try to help break down these tremendous language barriers and this horrible feeling of isolation on the part of a large number of people, especially the womenfolk to whom I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister for Foreign Affairs aware that the Australian Society for Inter-Country Aid to <span class="highlight">Children</span>, known as ASIAC, has a medical team of 13 personnel presently working among refugees on Guam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must not forget that about a quarter of the Australian population consists of either post-war migrants or <span class="highlight">children</span> of migrants and that 50 per cent to 55 per cent of these people have a nonEnglish speaking background. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During that month I scanned the newspapers because I had 7 <span class="highlight">children</span> at school and I had to support and feed them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to that I had rung him and he had told me to come and look at the house and conditions, how far it would be for my <span class="highlight">children</span> to go to school, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That because of the excessively high inflation rate, the Government decision to decrease the taxable allowance for education expenses from $400 to $ 1 50 per student will create unreasonable financial pressures upon many families and will cause great difficulty for such families to provide their <span class="highlight">children</span> with an adequate education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-0-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Board states that no such advertisement should be presented at a time when the audience is likely to contain a large proportion of <span class="highlight">children</span> or younger people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-This is a Bill to establish a <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission and to provide certain machinery in relation to the provision of services for <span class="highlight">children</span> as defined in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition does not support the way in which the Government has gone about creating this Commission and we do not believe it is the best way in which services for <span class="highlight">children</span> can be provided in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly the Opposition’s attitude is one in which we say that given the chance we would not be doing it this way but, because we support the underlying objectives of the Bill, we will be supporting it but moving a few relatively minor amendments, accepting that we have to deal with the structure as proposed, even though it is a structure which we do not believe will best serve the interests of <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are others whose competing point of view is that the accent should be on child care centres to supplement the needs of the mother, to establish her right to work, as well as alleviating the problems of <span class="highlight">children</span> whose parents need to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To believe that one could overcome the competing forces by establishing a commission and by saying, ‘here is a <span class="highlight">children</span>’s commission that will cure all your ills’, is a somewhat facile remedy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Opposition believes that it would be far better to establish a <span class="highlight">children</span>’s bureau whose functions would be to faciliate achieving the objectives of pre-school care and education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear to us to be preferable that such a <span class="highlight">children</span>’s bureau, sensitive to a number of social issues related to the care of <span class="highlight">children</span> and allowing social sensitivity to be much sooner and better realised, would be better than a somewhat bureaucratic structure subject to the failings that any bureaucratic structure tends to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without a lot of social upheaval in this area it is impossible as a short term overall objective, for the inescapable fact is that it is the private sector through people’s own capital investment in buildings and equipment which is bearing so much of the brunt and enabling fewer <span class="highlight">children</span> in the community to be so-called latch key <span class="highlight">children</span> than otherwise would occur if that sector were squeezed out of business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe it is an important sector, which must be recognised in the administration under the proposed legislation of the <span class="highlight">Children</span> ‘s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within child care centres there has been a shift away from the purely custodial care of <span class="highlight">children</span>, as it is becoming increasingly obvious that in the earlier years the child is learning at the fastest rate during his whole educational span. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the lower socio-economic areas the demand for this is increasing and there is an increasing awareness in the community that <span class="highlight">children</span> need more than just care- that they need a certain amount of educational content in the day’s activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would expect that the <span class="highlight">children</span>’s bureau, which we propose as an alternative approach, would take this up as a major activity and draw information from all sectors covered under the departmental framework of what we see as community development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also should be feasible for parents not only to control the administration of these centres but also to be involved in an advisory capacity, as already occurs in so many areas connected with the care and education of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important for parents of groups which may be termed disadvantaged to be involved in the progress of their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are glad to see that in the services to <span class="highlight">children</span> provision is made to enable that to happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that that will be one of the important tasks undertaken by the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission in carrying out its functions under the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the sort of thing that could be done through a <span class="highlight">children</span>’s bureau, where pooling resources in the area would help to facilitate achievement of the objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need to enable parents to obtain access to the latest pre-school education and care thinking is another important role to be undertaken by the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission or the <span class="highlight">children</span>’s bureau. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important, when talking about the play group and the parent involvement question, to remember one of the problems which have their effect upon <span class="highlight">children</span> in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any steps which the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission takes towards involving parents will have that dual benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one is talking about something like 1.3 million <span class="highlight">children</span> being in the age group with which we are concerned and if one is talking about the sorts of costs involved in relation to each of them, one can see that the amount involved is very great. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistent with all of the policies of the Opposition is that all <span class="highlight">children</span> should have an equal right to adequate pre-school education, especially if one realises that it is in this area that educational advantage first becomes manifest and the whole problem of social deprivation and subsequent delinquency has its origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are concerned also to ensure that adequate attention is given to encouraging parents to look after their own <span class="highlight">children</span> so far as possible, and to ensure that economic necessity does not deprive parents of the exercise of choice in this respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, believing that the family unit is of fundamental importance to our society and that steps should be taken to encourage mothers to be able freely to exercise a choice and to stay home to look after their <span class="highlight">children</span>, we believe that steps must be taken by this Government to facilitate that choice and that so far as the child care program of the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission is concerned adequate emphasis must be given to that aspect which, if one reads the Bill, one gets the feeling is not intended to be part of the function of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is at present a considerable fear among a number of Australian kindergartens that they will either be ignored or inadequately encouraged in carrying out their responsibilities to <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again I believe it would be of advantage if the Minister could indicate when concluding the debate just what is proposed in relation to kindergartens- whether it is true, for instance, that the person who is likely to be administering the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission role in the city of Sydney has indicated that that person will be imposing very substantial requirements on kindergartens that will change the whole way in which they will be operating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that it is a matter of fundamental concern that this should not be the development of a large bureaucracy controlling and directing the provision of services to <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Policies and programs, which vitally affect families and <span class="highlight">children</span>, are already spread over several departments including Social Security, Health, Tourism and Recreation, Labor, Aboriginal Affairs and Education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">children</span>’s bureau concept differs from the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission concept in the way in which the Brotherhood suggests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder what the Government is doing in relation to the important aspect of giving taxation relief as regards cost to parents of preschool <span class="highlight">children</span> or in child care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also has a specific interest in this case because there are many groups who believe that it is of the utmost importance that there be a ‘representative’ on the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the performance of its functions, the Commissioner shall, to the greatest extent practicable, consult and cooperate with Departments of State and with authorities established by or under laws of Australia, being Departments or authorities responsible for aspects of the planning of, the provision of, the training of persons to provide, and the provision of financial assistance for, services for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who is to say that an ordinary parent is any less capable of operating a day care or after school care centre or assisting in the running of an after school care centre than a person who may have plenty of academic qualifications but no practical experience in the handling of the <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It includes grants for such projects as mobile toy libraries, the construction of kindergarten centres and pre-school centres, repairs to houses used by play groups, outofschool centre staffing, provision for <span class="highlight">children</span>’s camps and provision of equipment and staff for socially and emotionally disturbed adolescentsa wide range of provisions to assist in the full development of all <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia itself must benefit, as any other country would benefit, through culturally and socially adjusted <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer him to a number of psychologists and psychiatrists who believe that we tend to create a mother image in our <span class="highlight">children</span>, that we leave them with a single image and that this is not always to the benefit of the child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think if we can establish, by this Bill, facilities where <span class="highlight">children</span> can be looked after capably and can develop emotionally and culturally from an early age, we will all benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find that a great deal of this tension and stress is taken out on their <span class="highlight">children</span> when the parents eventually arrive home from work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not need to remind Western Australian senators of the situation that existed there some years ago when a group of high school <span class="highlight">children</span> became concerned for the latchkey <span class="highlight">children</span> from the junior schools and endeavoured to set up play group areas in the school grounds after school hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a great number of latchkey <span class="highlight">children</span> in our society, and it is the responsibility of the community as much as the responsibility of the parents that we have those latchkey <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span> as young as 5 or 6 year of age are coming home to empty homes after school hours in the afternoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This must be of great concern not only to the parents but also to people who are not parents or to those people whose <span class="highlight">children</span> have grown up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly would not like to see industry or any industrial organisation setting up a child care centre, a pre-school centre or an after school centre that was not fully contained in the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sum of $43m will go a long way towards providing some of the facilities for <span class="highlight">children</span> that are essential in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I express my appreciation to the Interim Committee of the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not to say that there is criticism of some of the opportunities that may be opened up by the formation of the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission but to point to the difficulties of administering the Bill as it is in order to reach the people concerned in their local communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 5(1) (ii) of the Bill seeks to enable the Commission to deal directly with the governments of the States and Territories, local government bodies, charitable organisations and other organisations and persons for the establishment, development and maintenance of the means of providing services for <span class="highlight">children</span> or for research and planning in relation to those services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although under clause 5 (4) of the Bill the Commission is required to consult and co-operate with departments of state and with certain authorities, compliance with that provision would be made very difficult indeed by clause 3 1 of the Bill, which provides for the establishment in each State or Territory of the Commonwealth a <span class="highlight">Children</span> ‘s Commission Advisory Board constituted by and under the control of the responsible Federal Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government of Victoria wishes to record the fact that that Une of action is completely contrary to the arrangement that the Premier of Victoria made with the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in regard to the distribution of interim <span class="highlight">children</span>’s grants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague,  Senator Rae,  referred to the establishment of a <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Bureau as part of the Opposition’s policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pre-school care and education is regarded as being essential to the work of the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would have thought that the work that has been done on that aspect in one State would not need to be duplicated because it would be in that State that it would function for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer, first, to the term ‘services for <span class="highlight">children</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore understood that almost any service could be defined within the Commission’s operations as being a service applicable to <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason we wonder what the definition of the special needs of <span class="highlight">children</span> would embrace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of the fairly liberal definition of services for <span class="highlight">children</span>’ in this Bill, we would like to see more clearly defined what the Government would intend to be the requirement concerning <span class="highlight">children</span> in special need and how it sees that functioning as a service provided by the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that it has not been made clear that this service will include all <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact considerable emphasis has been placed on the <span class="highlight">children</span> who will have services provided for them while they are out of their homes, whereas there seems to have been no accent placed on services being provided for <span class="highlight">children</span> who may require them in their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is fair to compare the functions of and the services to people through the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission with the functions of and the services to people through some other commissions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think it is an unfair comparison to relate the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission to the Schools Commission or to the Social Welfare Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Schools Commission there is emphasis on providing the highest standards, making education available to all <span class="highlight">children</span> at such standard without fee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If high standards and skilled staff are recognised in those 2 commissions, I believe it is even more important that the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission should recognise that high standards and skilled staff are essential if we are to provide the standard of service that we believe is required by <span class="highlight">children</span> in their very early and formative years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to see a positive statement of such an aim made by the  Chairman  or by the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission so that we would see that there is not just emphasis on quantity of child care facilities or after school clubs but rather on the quality of the services provided for the needs of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s firm intention is to provide an imaginative and comprehensive range or services so that all <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia will have access to services that are designed to promote their well being . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to see a greater definition of the quality of service that we would want for Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not mention the rights of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of recognising the rights of <span class="highlight">children</span> and of every person in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To relate any provision of child care simply to the women in Australian society overlooks the fact that both parents have equal responsibilities in the care of their <span class="highlight">children</span> and that the <span class="highlight">children</span> have the fundamental and essential rights which are part of the Declaration of Human Rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that part of the Declaration of Human Rights which relates to <span class="highlight">children</span> is very beautifully expressed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I accept that proposition, but I would like to think that in the formation of the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission some opportunity would be taken to see that it is representative of the skills which are required for people to make decisions in this important area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that in setting up the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission, which is to have the permanency that the Government conceives, they may have adopted the same attitude that they did when they were in Opposition and recognised the need for specification of skills and professionalism for the people who would be appointed to do this important work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of dealing with the range of people who know the problems, who know the needs of <span class="highlight">children</span> and who are prepared to use that professionalism in the selection of care and facilities that are funded by the Federal Government to the State and voluntary organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important also to realise that the State and Territory <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission Advisory Boards, which are referred to in clause 31, should be the subject of some comment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must ask why they cannot be the means of communication with the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clause states that the Minister may establish a <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission Advisory Board in each State and Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply say, at this stage of our dealing with this proposal to establish the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission, that we have a sense of responsibility towards the <span class="highlight">children</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We express the hope that, whatever services are provided by government, it will be understood that in respect of this relationship with <span class="highlight">children</span> we are making very important decisions to provide services which will be of increasing importance to the future of this country in the development of healthy minds in <span class="highlight">children</span> and in the emotional development which will allow <span class="highlight">children</span> to take advantage of what we hope will be improved educational opportunities at all levels in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Mr Acting  Deputy President,  this <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission Bill sounds good, reasonable and plausible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s firm intention is to provide an imaginative and comprehensive range of services so that all <span class="highlight">children</span>- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government claims that the establishment of a <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission is a further recognition by the Government of the rights of women in Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason the Government gives for the necessity to introduce this Bill is that changing social patterns have put considerable pressures on families with infant and school-age <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also claims that many existing facilities are seriously under-used and that the answer lies in people who know how to look after <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: What is the cause of the changing social patterns that have put such pressures on our families and <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government implies that it can hire people who know how to look after <span class="highlight">children</span> better than their own parents do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its first year of operation the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission, which is to be established by this Bill, will rob our mothers of a further $74m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After robbing families of $74m which the Government says is to be expended on all <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia, the Government then allocates priorities to those <span class="highlight">children</span> whose parents are engaged in employment, to those <span class="highlight">children</span> who are not being cared for in their own homes, to those <span class="highlight">children</span> who need assistance and to those <span class="highlight">children</span> who are sick and physically disabled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is taking $74m away from families that have been made paupers by the Government and directing it towards financing the disruption of families, introducing the bureaucratisation of <span class="highlight">children</span> and creating a diminishing ability in parents to make their own decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it continues for very long, the Government will not need the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As was stated by the Government in another place, the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission will take its place beside the School’s Commission, the Technical and Further Education Commission, the Australian Universities Commission and the Commission of Advanced Education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point was made that pre-school kindergartens are worried about their existence and their figure, given that conditions are being imposed upon them to extend services or to integrate with other <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That subsidy will be paid in respect of each pre-school which extends and/or integrates its services in a manner compatible with the philosophy of the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission and the needs of the particular community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pre-schools could also be used as a base from which to operate a family day care program which eligible <span class="highlight">children</span> could attend on a sessional basis and where care givers could come together for discussions, seminars and the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be possible also for a toy library to operate from the pre-school for other <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paragraph (c) states:  the care of <span class="highlight">children</span> other than pre-school aged <span class="highlight">children</span> at a time or times of the day when they are not being provided with an educational service and are not being cared for in their own homes; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paragraph (g) states:  other services, not being educational services or other services prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph, provided to <span class="highlight">children</span>, or to the parents of <span class="highlight">children</span>, that will be conducive to meeting the needs of <span class="highlight">children</span> having special needs or to promoting the physical, social or mental development of <span class="highlight">children</span>; . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There does not appear to be any specific encouragement for parents who elect to care for their own <span class="highlight">children</span> on a full-time basis rather than taking the alternative of working and making use of child care facilities provided and encouraged pursuant to this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The definition provides for a wide range of services for <span class="highlight">children</span> throughout the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some services are directed specifically towards <span class="highlight">children</span> whose parent or parents are working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would anyone be prepared to say that these <span class="highlight">children</span> do not have a need for care? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is worth examining the Child Care Act to see what assistance was given to the <span class="highlight">children</span> of parents who were not employed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Child Care Act was designed to cater for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of working parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By introducing this Bill the Government recognises that all <span class="highlight">children</span> should have access to a comprehensive range of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services to meet their needs, and the scope of the definition of ‘services for <span class="highlight">children</span>’ is deliberately quite wide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, paragraph (b) refers to ‘the education of pre-school aged <span class="highlight">children</span>’, paragraph (f) refers to ‘assistance to, and counselling of, parents in relation to the raising of <span class="highlight">children</span>’, and paragraph (g) refers to ‘other services’, and obviously applies to all <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Physically or mentally disabled or handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> are able to attract these services when they are not cared for in their own homes but fit <span class="highlight">children</span> who are being cared for in their own homes are excluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the Government’s attention to this aspect and to the concern of people who do care for their sick <span class="highlight">children</span> for periods of time and who could benefit from supportive services that may be available, even the short term supportive services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel sure that the usual definition would be applied to physically or mentally disabled or handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> as we know it in other Acts and they are included if they are not in their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the performance of its functions, the Commission shall, to the greatest extent practicable, consult and cooperate with Departments of State and with authorities established by  or  under laws of Australia, being Departments or authorities responsible for aspects of the planning of, the provision of, the training of persons to provide, and the provision of financial assistance for, services for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that this approach has a number of faults, which I outlined, and that it would be much better to approach it from the point of view of creating a <span class="highlight">children</span>’s bureau. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of that is that the Government is proposing that funds in respect of the services for <span class="highlight">children</span> will be paid by the Commonwealth pursuant to section 8 1 of the Constitution direct to receiving bodies, be they local government bodies, private organisations or whatever they may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not in any way suggest that the moneys that have been appropriated should not be made available for the purposes of providing services for <span class="highlight">children</span>; it is simply a question of the mode to be adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will also lessen the likelihood of creating an all powerful bureaucracy from the centre and we believe it will make the ultimate result more in the interests of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Unlike the Child Care Act, this Bill provides for advisory boards to enable consultation with State governments, local government and the voluntary agencies involved in providing <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is it that there is no emphasis at all in clause 5 or elsewhere in the Bill on any concept of the development and protection of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s rights as such? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Government’s firm intention that by 1980 all <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia will have access to services designed to take care of their educational, emotional, physical, social and recreational needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government is committed to providing care for as many <span class="highlight">children</span> as possible, especially where it is most needed and in the way that people want it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want the community to be involved in the care of its <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means wc wish to help citizens to identify their real needs and to play a part in initiating and managing services for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister then pre-empts the recommendations of the proposed <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission by stating what the Government’s policy will be in 1976; for example, that the Government will pay 75 per cent of the salaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is the approach, perhaps we will have to pose this further question: Should not all primary schools have their funds cut off if they do not extend or integrate their services in the light of the program of the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>to ascertain the needs of the Australian community for services for <span class="highlight">children</span> and to make recommendations to the Minister in respect of those needs, including recommendations in relation to- (iri) the education and training of persons involved, or to be involved, in the provision of services for <span class="highlight">children</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the performance of its functions, the Commission shall, to the greatest extent practicable, consult and cooperate with Departments of State and with authorities established by or under laws of Australia, being Departments or authorities responsible for aspects of the planning of, the provision of, the training of persons to provide, and the provision of financial assistance for, services for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At some time a future <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission might find it impracticable to have any consultation and co-operation when obviously the judgment as to what is the greatest extent practicable would be the judgment of the Commission itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We never thought it necessary to include the words ‘or of any State or Territory’ because of clause 31 of the Bill which sets up State and Territory <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission Advisory Boards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These advisory boards consist of representatives of State government, local government, community groups and at present the Interim Committee for the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in our view that does not adequately cover the requirement that consultation and co-operation so far as the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission is concerned should be community based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There needs to be some relationship between the preschool planning in the various States and the provision of what might be additional child care facilities for those <span class="highlight">children</span> who have working parents away from the home during several hours of each day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The criticism is that pre-schooling has primarily benefited <span class="highlight">children</span> whose mothers can afford to stay at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we ought to be questioning whether there is co-ordination between the kindergartens or pre-school centres in the various States and what might be attempted under the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission with the child care facilities that are to be developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I think that the State advisory bodies are the best organisations to advise the new <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission on what plans are already in existence and how they may facilitate the overall concept of improved services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No one should impose upon an association of people the demand that they should in some way destroy the environment in which they live and in which their <span class="highlight">children</span> shall live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He could come before a conference and say to the person against whom the complaint is made: ‘I believe that justice requires that you should pay to the complainant a sum of $ 1 , 000 or $2,000 ‘ or ‘ You should educate his <span class="highlight">children</span> at a school’ or something of that character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were not trying to do anything except convince the government of the day that they needed justice in respect of their tribal land rights, the health of their <span class="highlight">children</span>, employment opportunities and better health for the community generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We find that by the use of bilingual education in schools Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> no longer begin their education at a disadvantage to European <span class="highlight">children</span> by being taught in a foreign language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yes, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs is funding various organisations in regard to the involvement of <span class="highlight">children</span> in cultural community relationships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From the outset the scheme provided such benefits as full pension on invalidity retirement during service, pensions for widows and <span class="highlight">children</span> on the death of the member and the opportunity to purchase full pension on normal retirement after reaching age 60. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This improvement will extend to present scheme pensions as will an improvement in <span class="highlight">children</span>’s pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Subject to the improvement in spouses’ and <span class="highlight">children</span>’s pensions, pensions already in existence at 30 June 1975 will continue to be paid at the levels provided by the present Act and be updated annually in accordance with the 1.4 times formula 1 have previously explained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It applies to spouses’ and <span class="highlight">children</span>’s pensions that are payable or may become payable in the future under that Act the levels of benefits provided in the new scheme and applies also the wider eligibility provisions of that scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that one of the conditions required was that the <span class="highlight">children</span> were to wear red uniforms? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable senators, I present a report on educational turbulence among Australian servicemen’s <span class="highlight">children</span> by Lindsay Mackay and Brian Spicer of the Faculty of Education, Monash University. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We only trust that in spite of all the defects which will arise the <span class="highlight">children</span> concerned will not be disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other quite significant and highly desirable features are that contributors or their dependants have options to take part of the benefit on death or retirement as a lump sum; Provident Fund contributors will receive the same benefits as other contributors on retirement and improved benefits on death or invalidity; <span class="highlight">children</span> and orphans will receive better benefits; and the position of temporary public servants is to be improved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition also supports these advantages of the new scheme: The option for retirement between the ages of 60 to 65 to continue under the new scheme with pension adjusted proportionately; the option to take part of the benefit as a lump sum introduced in the new scheme- I understand that is encouraged by the Opposition- comparable benefits provided for members of the Provident Fund; improved benefits for temporary public servants; improved benefits for widowers, <span class="highlight">children</span> and orphans; and greatly simplified administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  I  have stated, the amendments relate to the widows pension formula and the <span class="highlight">children</span>’s benefit formula. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For a widow with 3 dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> the payment equals 100 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The amendment does reduce widows pensions but if there are 4 dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> the pension amounts to 100 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument that in the event of the death of a contributor who has 4 <span class="highlight">children</span> a 100 per cent benefit would be paid out, of course is quite true. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increasing the initial payment to 67 per cent and adding 1 1 per cent for each of the 3 <span class="highlight">children</span> makes a 100 per cent payment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is, of course, that only a small minority of families in Australia now have 4 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At that meeting, did  Mr Piesse  state in a paper which he delivered thtat there were grave deficiencies in the service presently offered by the National Acoustic Laboratories for <span class="highlight">children</span> with hearing problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-59-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the areas of concern include testing of hearing, the working relationship between audiologists and teachers, training programs for audiologists and teachers, parent education, the selection and fitting of suitable aids, the need for improved ear mould making techniques, the need for more effective checking and maintenance of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s aids. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-59-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In referring to developments in audiology services provided in a school in California visited by a member of his staff  Mr Piesse  said that certain factors observed in the school program might afford opportunity to provide further additional benefits for Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-59-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reference was to the program to provide high powered behind-the-ear hearing aids to all severely and profoundly deaf <span class="highlight">children</span> who might benefit as part of the continuing program for the development and provision of an expanded range of aids. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-59-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Laboratories’ method of evaluation of a hearing aid fitting which can be used with <span class="highlight">children</span> only 9 months of age is thought to be ahead of techniques used elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-59-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have received quite an amount of correspondence from people expressing concern that if this Bill is not carried <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs could be adversely affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have also had correspondence from people who say that <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs should be not heavy educational programs but of a light entertainment type because <span class="highlight">children</span> need time to relax when they come home from school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They want to do all they can to present the type of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s program that will give the greatest benefit to the young people, but there are problems involved in this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If television stations were to present a program which some <span class="highlight">children</span> would refer to as being very stuffy <span class="highlight">children</span> would not watch it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some parents say that this is the best thing that <span class="highlight">children</span> can do- go out of doors, exercise and get some fresh air. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Opposition and I fully support the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Television Action Committee and the work it is doing, I can assure this chamber that the television industry itself is giving and has given a lot of thought to what can be done to present the best type of program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the cooperation of people in the television industry and their acceptance of responsibility, and through constructive discussions and trial and error, I hope that one day we will reach a situation where most people- we will never please all people- will be happy with the type of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television programs that are presented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say that in all fairness to the commercial television people who, as I say, are genuinely trying to do all they can to give the best type of program for the <span class="highlight">children</span>, and this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span>’s programming has also been suggested as one reason why we need these amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Young  has referred to our attitude with regard to <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has a very sincere interest in improving the quality of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programming in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To suggest that the amendments affecting the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, as we see them before us at the present time, are the only way in which this can be achieved is again to overlook the requirements of quality <span class="highlight">children</span> ‘s programming and many other things that need to be taken into consideration if this is to be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We would like to see the formation of a <span class="highlight">children</span>’s film foundation in this country so that we could be producing quality films. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We would like to see a real objective in using television as a medium to entertain and educate <span class="highlight">children</span> and to make them part of a culturally aware community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that these things need to be put into perspective when we are talking about a new Bill, new amendments and the Government’s contention that it needs these amendents so that the Broadcasting Control Board can, in the terms of the Government, achieve greater Australian content and a better quality of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let one consider the position of the new settlers in Australia over the last 30 years, the period which saw an influx of hundreds of thousands of people- indeed I think it fair to say millions- looking for a new life and new hope for their <span class="highlight">children</span>, far from the anguish and tragedy which the Second World War brought to their homelands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Increased widows pensions will cost $ 1 48m; provision for widower pensions- I emphasise the words ‘widower pensions’- will cost $106m; increasing <span class="highlight">children</span>’s pensions will cost $30m; giving an option on death and invalidity will cost $464m; the improved option on early retirement will cost $30m; and improved options on existing schemes will cost $97m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They did it because they were forced by the authorities to leave, since by that time it was felt that Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> should be educated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators can imagine what it was like in those days, without the kind of money and job opportunities that are available today, and the parents of those <span class="highlight">children</span> could not provide even the rowing boat so they could not get their <span class="highlight">children</span> to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us take the example of a man earning $ 135 a week at present- the type of man who falls within the $100 to $150 a week of which the Treasurer talks- with a dependent wife and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government has direct responsibility for the education of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> in the Northern Territory and, in accordance with its policy of preserving Aboriginal languages and cultures, has introduced a program under which Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> living in Aboriginal communities receive primary education in their own language and instruction in traditional Aboriginal arts, crafts and skills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has made significant changes in the degree of financial expenditure and in the area over which a number of social developments have taken place, particularly in relation to the <span class="highlight">children</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aim is to provide a free dental service to all primary school <span class="highlight">children</span> by 1982, and subsequently, to pre-school and secondary school <span class="highlight">children</span> under 1 5 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Double orphan’s pensions will be extended to cover <span class="highlight">children</span> whose sole surviving parent or adoptive parent has been committed to prison for not less than 10 years or is a long term patient in a mental hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since then  Mr Fraser  has said that the Budget penalises those who save through life or superannuation policies and who want to provide a different kind of education for their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Fraser  went on to say that people should have freedom to choose what kind of education they wanted for their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means that 208 000 more <span class="highlight">children</span> are now attending technical schools in Australia than when this Government came to power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It means that 208 000 more <span class="highlight">children</span> have the opportunity to attend those schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Hundreds and thousands of other school <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia are now for the first time getting the benefit of decent equipment and better buildings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly what  Mr Fraser  means when he talks about freedom in education is that freedom of people to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to private schools with the benefit of big concessions which favour the rich. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Liberal government would favour concessions to the rich and concessions to those who want the freedom to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to private schools at the expense of every other child in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government of the time put a 33  lA  per cent sales tax on <span class="highlight">children</span>’s toys, a 20 per cent sales tax on ice cream and sweets, a 20 per cent sales tax on razor blades and a 25 per cent sales tax on the birthday cake and the Christmas cake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A person earning $7,000 a year or $135 a week, with a nonworking wife and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>, will pay $4.06 a week less in tax- a cut of some 27 per cent in his tax bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Have honourable senators ever heard of a man on the minimum wage having house help, unless it is his own <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that most of those people- certainly an increasing proportion of them- no longer can afford to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to boarding school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no local school which the <span class="highlight">children</span> can attend; so they have to use correspondence courses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>A large proportion of people in Queensland and certainly, I am sure, in other States who depend on correspondence courses to educate their <span class="highlight">children</span> cannot afford to have the courses delivered any more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question implies that the teachers of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> require to undertake a specialist training course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have had <span class="highlight">children</span> going to school in Victoria for the last 25 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When my eldest <span class="highlight">children</span> started school in Victoria there was a boom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had to turn up at school 2 days before the commencing date to enrol the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had to ensure that our <span class="highlight">children</span> had turned 5 years of age at a minute past 12 on a certain day; otherwise we could not get them into school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After these hundreds and hundreds of parents and <span class="highlight">children</span> turned up at schools for the <span class="highlight">children</span> to commence their first years of schooling, one would have thought that a government which cared and planned would have known that in 6 years time those <span class="highlight">children</span> would turn up at technical schools and high schools and that it would have started to plan then to accommodate them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When our <span class="highlight">children</span> reached the age when they had to go to technical school or high school, what happened? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We turned up in the same old queues and we met the same mothers and the same <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">children</span> still had to have the impossible qualifications- they had to have turned a certain age at a certain minute past a certain hour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One might have thought that a government could have been caught unawares then and that it would have planned for when those <span class="highlight">children</span> went on to tertiary education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was the same hotch-potch of accommodation for <span class="highlight">children</span>; there was the same hotch-potch of accommodation for their education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even in a State which cares as much about preschool education as Victoria does, if it had not been for the money that this Federal Government had given to Victoria we would not have been able to get our <span class="highlight">children</span> into pre-schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He says that it is because of the Federal Government that he cannot plan a decent education for our <span class="highlight">children</span> in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In parts of Victoria there are still schools which can get no library grant or no additional assistance because the parents of the <span class="highlight">children</span> attending those schools cannot raise the first little bit of money that is needed before the Victorian Education Department will match the grant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are still <span class="highlight">children</span> who go to schools that are a dust bowl in the summer and a mud heap in the winter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only because of the devotion and the inspiration of the teachers and the head teachers in those schools that the <span class="highlight">children</span> get any sort of assistance at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of them are migrant <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it had not been for this Government which said that all <span class="highlight">children</span> are entitled to an education, those migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> would still be struggling along with no assistance whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As it is, so many of these migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> still try to cope with English, which is a new language to them, in the laundry or the toilet or the cloakroom of the school into which they have been plonked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Technical education was not just the  Cinderella  of education in Victoria; it barely existed because, after all, the <span class="highlight">children</span> receiving technical education came from families who did not matter much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">children</span> came primarily from areas in which there was a Labor member of Parliament and, after all, that other government was not going to help those sorts of areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These were the <span class="highlight">children</span> who were destined to be factory fodder, so far as the previous Government was concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government believes that all <span class="highlight">children</span> are deserving of education, irrespective of whether they are mentally retarded, and that it is the responsibility of government to provide that education and not the responsibility of flower hatted ladies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Fraser did not notice that the single mothers had <span class="highlight">children</span> to raise and needed a pension and that their <span class="highlight">children</span> needed to be treated like human beings, but now he says that the Opposition Parties have noticed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>After all, one would think that a Liberal-Country Party government would have taken into account that there are <span class="highlight">children</span>, that there are parents and that there are women who live in extraordinarily isolated circumstances and who have as much right to a good education and to converse with their fellows as has anybody else, but what did it do about it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have encouraged advancements in the education of young <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In response to  Senator Wright’s  claim that a record amount of money was being spent on education, we said at that time that it would be necessary to spend at least 4 times as much to give Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> a standard of education equal to that given to those attending schools in the United States of America, Sweden, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom or any other advanced nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have since increased the expenditure on education to some $ 1,900m because we believe that the <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australia and the people of Australia are entitled to enjoy the same educational standards as people in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he consult with his colleague with a view to prohibiting in the Australian Capital Territory the sale to <span class="highlight">children</span> of imitation cigarettes in the form of sweets which are packaged like real cigarettes and labelled ‘Fags’, as these lollies are a great inducement to <span class="highlight">children</span> to become addicted to the health destroying habit of smoking? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At one time it was very rare to hear of a mother leaving her <span class="highlight">children</span> to the support of the husband, but today it is becoming common and the father of a young family has only 2 alternatives: He can either give up the <span class="highlight">children</span> and let them go into the custody of the state, or he can give up his employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In turning to the proposal to extend the scope of double orphan’s pension I should first say that this pension was introduced by the present Government in September 1973 as a measure of assistance for people caring for <span class="highlight">children</span> who have permanently lost the companionship, support and comfort normally provided by parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government feels that the position of these <span class="highlight">children</span> is not greatly different from that of <span class="highlight">children</span> whose parents are both dead or where one parent is dead and the whereabouts of the other unknown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Generally this means that women and <span class="highlight">children</span> go first and then there is a cutting down of the Embassy staff until the very last moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In brief, a ‘tax rebate of $400 will replace the existing deduction of $364 for a spouse, a rebate of $200 will replace the deduction of $260 for a student child or for one child under 16 years of age, and a rebate of $150 will replace the deduction of $208 for other <span class="highlight">children</span> under 16 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make this quite clear: Our new tax scheme removes the inequitable system of concessional deductions and replaces it with a fairer system of rebates, Further, a new allowance- a rebate of $200- is to be introduced for parents without partners who are maintaining <span class="highlight">children</span> who qualify for concessional rebates as dependants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The definition of student for the purpose of the higher of the two rebates for <span class="highlight">children</span> is to be extended from the present definition to include any child under 25 years of age receiving full-time education at a school, college or university. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the previous, more restrictive definition, only <span class="highlight">children</span> between the ages of 16 and 25 could qualify as a student. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For persons with dependants, the threshold will range from $4,001 where the only dependant is a spouse, to $5,943 where there is a dependant spouse and three <span class="highlight">children</span>, including two at school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister agree that in some cases single men who are responsible for the upbringing of their <span class="highlight">children</span> are worse off than single mothers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian family man with a dependant wife and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> is able to earn more than $100 a week free of tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So one can see that for a family man claiming for a dependent spouse and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> the benefits flow up to a weekly income of $200. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We could find that a taxpayer with a dependent wife and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> under 16 years of age on a net income of $8,000 may save 19 per cent of his tax liability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have said, the benefits are there for the family man with a wife and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, in addition to the $540 rebate which will be available to all taxpayers, the deductions which applied for expenses incurred in earning an income will be retained, as will the zonal allowance, which is an important concession for those living outside the main centres of population, and the existing concessions as they relate to spouses and <span class="highlight">children</span>, gifts to charities and school building funds, as well as the deduction for interest on home repayments to which I have referred already. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that year the tax on average earnings was $743 for a man with a wife and 2 dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Take a taxpayer with a wife and 2 dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> who .is on the same income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One objective is to achieve a more equitable distribution of the burden of taxation that is borne by individual taxpayers, especially in single income families- that is, the worker who has a dependent wife and <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian family man with a dependent wife and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> will be able to earn more than $100 a week free of tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For example, a bread winner with a dependent wife and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>, who was referred to, I think, by the honourable senator, will be freed of taxes on an income of $5,229 or less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said that the provision of a minimum rebate of $540 for taxpayers whose eligible rebatable expenditure is $1,350 or less, will operate as a disincentive to saving through life insurance and will discourage families from spending on the education of their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The better view is that persons who spend relatively small amounts on life assurance or to educate their <span class="highlight">children</span> include, as a general rule, those who are not financially able to do otherwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia has also contributed $4.7m this year to the multilateral agencies operating in Indo-China, namely the Indo-China Bureau of International Committee of the Red Cross, the United Nations <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Fund (UNICEF), and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We propose to do that so that top priorities are given to <span class="highlight">children</span>, to classrooms and to teachers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to a Press release issued by the Minister, dated 17 February, in which she stated that the effect of the announced cut of $9m to the Interim Committee for the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission budget allocation would be a slowing down of already approved capital projects and the curtailing of new projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How much of the $6Sm allocated to the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission for 1 975-76 is to be spent on establishing full day care services this financial year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allocation of priorities to applications is dealt with by State committees which have been set up to work with the Interim Committee for the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there is a greater need for the integration of child care and pre-school facilities as this will permit the provision of such services to many more <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is equally important, of course, to parents, particularly women, who wish to work or who require such facilities for their <span class="highlight">children</span> so that they can participate more fully in community affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I especially welcome the Governor-General’s announcement that the relevant Government commissions will be asked to give close attention to measures designed to achieve greater equality in education facilities and particularly to provide better educational opportunities for the disadvantaged, handicapped, Aboriginal, isolated and migrant <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Two of these daughters have <span class="highlight">children</span> of their own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am thoroughly concerned that the school <span class="highlight">children</span> should be accommodated as they are in the showground in corrugated iron buildings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He announced that preference would be given to refugees closely related to people already living in Australia and that priority would be given to re-uniting spouses and <span class="highlight">children</span> with their families in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the Australian Capital Territory in particular, it is perhaps opportune to note that in this area the handicapped child’s allowance is payable at $10 a week to parents or guardians caring for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of claims by the socalled  Deputy  Governor of the Indonesian held areas of East Timor that 60 000 people, mostly women and <span class="highlight">children</span>, have been massacred by Indonesian troops or so-called volunteers, I ask: What protests have been made to the neo-fascist Government of Indonesia by the Australian Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That woman and her 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> are going to Rangoon to see her husband’s people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These gaps concern in particular the problems of lone fathers who are supporting families: the problems of large families in general who arc not helped by any present income maintenance system: and equally, the problems that most pensioners and beneficiaries of short term benefits with <span class="highlight">children</span> have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for Social Security: In view of the confusion and the anxiety in the minds of those who are concerned with child care matters in this country, will the Minister give a detailed statement of cuts to the proposed <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission expenditure? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about the fact that the advisory committees in the various States of Australia have unnumerable applications, totalling something like 600, for approval under the child care, <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be said also that the Government has asked the Interim Committee for the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission to look very actively at those projects which could claim that their activities will be closed if they do not receive funding in this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of other such ill-informed claims that the Government has no specific commitment to funding full day care services for <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only in the past 2 months that the Government has had any opportunity to place some emphasis on <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services outside of the pre-school area, owing to the lack of development during the term of the previous Government in this area of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where some assertions have been made with regard to the Australian Capital Territory, it is of interest to note that the Interim Committee for the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission is not the body that has been allocating funds to the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From Medibank to the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission, through a whole range of projects the threat exists; the axe is held over their heads. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There have been claims made by the puppet Governor of the Indonesian-held areas of East Timor, Lopez da Cruz, and published in the Australian Press that 60 000 people, mostly women and <span class="highlight">children</span>, have been massacred in East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, we have not been told the exact nature of the cut of $9m in respect of the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are things that the people who are operating the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission centres need to know- the people who felt that they could do something for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australia under the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the people who need assistance most are the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They arrive at these refuges with their <span class="highlight">children</span> in tow and in a distressed and distraught condition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to refer to the provision of services for <span class="highlight">children</span> in the community for which $65 m is to be spent this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will ensure the fullest use of resources and facilities in the interests of both <span class="highlight">children</span> and parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will ensure that the maximum number of <span class="highlight">children</span> in the community are cared for in the most appropriate way and that their parents are thus free to participate in community affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The long term aim of the present Government is to shift the balance of funding for <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services from an emphasis on the single pre-school and kindergarten function to a balance between the full range of services, including full day care, occasional and emergency care, toy libraries and parent education programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These arrangements will necessarily take time to implement, particularly given the previous Government’s emphasis on pre-school funding often to the exclusion of other services and the integration of facilities for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We thus want to ensure that there is an integration of facilities for <span class="highlight">children</span> in the community- not just pre-school, but occasional, day care and other facilities- so that both <span class="highlight">children</span> and parents in the community gain maximum benefit from such facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the Goulburn Valley Driver Training Complex at Shepparton there are comprehensive facilities which enable the complete instruction of <span class="highlight">children</span> from the ages of 14 to 18 years in the whole gamut of problems which arise out of the use or abuse of the motor car. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Headlines such as ‘8000 <span class="highlight">children</span> this year cannot get into schools’, as  Senator Missen  knows, have occurred every year for the past 6 years and they are still occurring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The child care survey in 1973 showed that a quarter of a million women with dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> aged 12 or under were in the work force and about 125 000 women with dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> under 6 years of age were in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the first time all women who, for any reason, were the sole support of <span class="highlight">children</span> were entitled to a modest level of government assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, acting on the socialist principle that the community through the auspices of government willingly assumes responsibility for its vulnerable members, the Labor Government set up the Interim Committee for the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission to develop integrated child care and development programs for pre-school age <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As well as assisting to ease the isolation experienced by the people in these regions it would be invaluable to enable isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> to watch the regular school broadcasts and thereby to greatly increase their education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to the woman who, under a great deal of economic pressure, decides to do the most important job in this community- that is, the mother who stays home, who looks after and who nurtures her <span class="highlight">children</span> into good citizens? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The cost of getting the other <span class="highlight">children</span> cared for while the mother attends a clinic adds to the burden and creates a situation which we believe should not exist in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this area there are people who cannot help the position in which they find themselves; there are people who have a child or a family of <span class="highlight">children</span> with chronic complaints; and there are grown-ups who have chronic complaints and who, through no fault of their own, do not have the income to deal with the costs involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a cruel attitude to adopt to a mother who has five or six <span class="highlight">children</span>, whose husband is at work, who has not got a car and who has to use public transport or a taxi to get to a public hospital and to find people to look after her <span class="highlight">children</span> while she is at the hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are so many men in government, including local government, who truly and honestly believe- they are not bad men- that in establishing kindergartens one is providing child care, whereas we know that that is a tiny part of educating a child in some ways and that it does not get down to the root of child care, of after school and before school care when mothers and fathers have to go to work, of care for <span class="highlight">children</span> whose mothers and fathers have taken ill, have gone away or have had accidents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What happens to those <span class="highlight">children</span> at the moment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well the health departments in the various States telling us that unless one provides a toilet that is 2 feet high and there are windows that are 4 feet off the ground one cannot open a child care facility but the point is that for years people around the corner and down the street have minded <span class="highlight">children</span> and for years those <span class="highlight">children</span> have managed to deal with toilets that are a little higher than those at home and they do not seem to have come off the worse for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have to get down to in that area is looking at the people who need the care- that is the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of claims by the so-called  Deputy  Governor of the Indonesian-held areas of East Timor that 60 000 people, mostly women and <span class="highlight">children</span>, have been massacred by Indonesian troops or so-called volunteers, I ask: What protests have been made to the neo-fascist Government of Indonesia by the Australian Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-47-5">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In an interview given to several Indonesian newspapers in Jakarta on 12 February,  Mr Lopez  da Cruz, a leader of the UDT party in East Timor, was reported as stating that there had been some 50 000-60 000 casualties since the outbreak of fighting in East Timor, many of them women and <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-47-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I speak of the need of the single fathers, the supporting fathers, of <span class="highlight">children</span>, particularly pre-school age <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The government should assist disadvantaged families where a single parent, a father, is caring for <span class="highlight">children</span>, whether he is a widower or a deserted husband. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in this category there are some 25 000 families and perhaps up to 50 000 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The anomaly is that if a widow is caring for such <span class="highlight">children</span> there are government programs to assist her, but if a male parent has accepted the total responsibility for the <span class="highlight">children</span> there is no government assistance to which he is entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no recognition of the special need of the supporting father and the <span class="highlight">children</span> in such families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I see no reason why there should be discrimination against a husband who is supporting young <span class="highlight">children</span> going to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is this meagre allowance that induces women to put their <span class="highlight">children</span> into child care centres and join the work force to keep up with the Joneses- the working sisters with their ever-increasing financial commitments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Educational facilities for <span class="highlight">children</span> in the Territory have improved considerably over the past few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are badly needed particularly as so many <span class="highlight">children</span> are living in temporary accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Premier,  Sir Eric  Willis, for a decision last year that shattered the hopes of more than 1000 parents of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The State Government was entirely proper in those circumstances in not a seeking to take on more burdens in terms of schools for handicapped people and schools for retarded <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the last 3 weeks the Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick),  who is a member of this chamber, has been blaming everything that is happening in the field of education on the Labor Government, while he takes away from the primary schools and the retarded <span class="highlight">children</span> in this community the sums of money that they so badly need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very fine opportunities presented in the past to teachers in the Commonwealth Teaching Service have meant that the service has been able to attract teachers of the highest calibre and that, in turn, the <span class="highlight">children</span> in the territories have had the opportunity of receiving first class teaching. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there are signs at the moment that the standards are under threat, and I refer particularly to the reduction in teaching hours of English as a second language for the many migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> in the schools in the territory, and to remedial teaching hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is acceptable neither to members of the Commonwealth Teaching Service nor to the parents of the <span class="highlight">children</span> in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope also that it will not mean- there are some signs now that it might mean- a lowering of the previously high standard of education enjoyed by <span class="highlight">children</span> in the schools in the Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a very big responsibility because we have so many <span class="highlight">children</span> living in the outback, in the bush and on small settlements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">children</span> need to be given an education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Northern Territory today there is very little opportunity for many of the <span class="highlight">children</span>- particularly the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>- to receive an education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of our big responsibilities is to concentrate particularly on these Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of assimilation- if that is what we like to call it- which is the breaking down of tribal barriers, and because of the increase in the number of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> they cannot live their own way of life but must join in our way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one had gone to some of these places a couple of years ago one would have found happy communities in which Aboriginal people were working and <span class="highlight">children</span> were going to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of this state of affairs is that the <span class="highlight">children</span> follow the example of their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The education of many of this generation of <span class="highlight">children</span> whom we would have expected to come forward and join in the life of the Northern Territory will be wasted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many of these <span class="highlight">children</span> come from poor circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their home life is not the same as that of other <span class="highlight">children</span> inasmuch as they recieve very little encouragement with respect to homework, school life and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">children</span> go to primary school and some go on to high school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The type of curriculum that is taught to these <span class="highlight">children</span> in high school is such that the work is of little interest to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we do see in towns in the Northern Territory is that these <span class="highlight">children</span> leave school before the age prescribed- many in the Territory leave school at 13 years, 14 years or 15 years- and wander the streets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, I believe that if these <span class="highlight">children</span> were given some training involving the use of their hands- some technical training- good results would be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this sort of training could be introduced for these <span class="highlight">children</span> it is my belief that they could play their part in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I look forward to the Government receiving that report as I believe that if the Government picks up the recommendations of that report- I understand that the establishment of a rural college in Katherine is recommended- this will bring about more training and eventually more job opportunities for <span class="highlight">children</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the good of the Department of Education and for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the Northern Territory, I hope that this matter can be reconsidered and that the teaching service will be allowed once again to grow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators may recall that the SEBAC report indicated that quite a deal of money would need to be spent to bring Aboriginal schools up to the same standard as those operating for European <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only do we have many Aboriginal people attending the community schools but also the oilier <span class="highlight">children</span> should have a good background of the Aboriginal culture which is so rich. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the Senate pledge any assistance which we can give to ensure that all <span class="highlight">children</span> of the Northern Territory obtain that equality of education which is the present Government’s avowed aim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I asked: Would the elders help to improve the attendance of their <span class="highlight">children</span> at school? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Katherine, Darwin and Gove I spoke to secondary school principals and to their teachers and tried to establish how best we can not only establish matriculation classes but also raise the quality of matriculation to so high a standard that no Australian in the Territory would want to send his <span class="highlight">children</span> south for their education in preference to sending them to Darwin or to any of the places I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, the cost now of sending <span class="highlight">children</span> south for their education is prohibitive, particularly for people in the grazing industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It also axed from the Budget to the extent of $9m grants for the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission child care projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the Schools Commission, the first decent national funding of education for <span class="highlight">children</span> throughout Australia; the interim committee on child care of the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission, which was to establish for the first time high standard, properly funded government child care services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, by saying that no doubt the Minister is aware that a family with 4 <span class="highlight">children</span> would receive child endowment of $5.75 a week and yet if, due to divorce, the family were divided into 2 groups with each parent looking after 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>, each group would receive only $1.50 a week- a total of $3. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has been stated is largely accurate, although it should be stated also that if there were a separation of a temporary nature with a family of 4 <span class="highlight">children</span> an amount representing endowment on the <span class="highlight">children</span> who remained with the parties would be paid to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the separation were of a permanent nature then what has been stated in the question is accurate, that is, $1.50 would be paid to each parent if each of them had 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> with him or her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs: Is she aware that the National Conference on Adoption which was held in Sydney in February gave total support to the placement in Aboriginal families of all Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> available for adoption or fostering? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister give the Senate an undertaking that she will support the setting up of Aboriginal-run and controlled agencies in the States and the Territories to facilitate the placement of such <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, the question referred to the adoption of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reiterate that the adoption of <span class="highlight">children</span> in this country is a matter of State government activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arising from the Minister’s statement on expenditure on <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services, could she advise how many new pre-school centres have been funded this financial year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the sort of people who are totally unconcerned about the <span class="highlight">children</span> they have reared and about their descendants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was also a moment of recognition of the fact that Australia is a country of a fair go, a fair go for everyone, regardless of his origin, a country which millions of migrants like myself have adopted as their home and as the home of their <span class="highlight">children</span> and their <span class="highlight">children</span>’s <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We deliberately have made and shall make local government a vehicle for our legislation on aged persons homes and hostels, sheltered employment, handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>, Meals on Wheels, home care and nursing, nursing homes, and homeless men and women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, I rise this evening to make a plea to the Government to reconsider the action that it has taken to remove from the pharmaceutical benefits list cows’ milk substitutes for <span class="highlight">children</span> of and over the age of 18 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is that from 1 April cows’ milk substitutes will not be on the pharmaceutical benefits list for <span class="highlight">children</span> of and over the age of 1 8 months, whereas until now they have been available for <span class="highlight">children</span> up to the age of 6 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some <span class="highlight">children</span> over the age of 18 months do need cows’ milk substitutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cows’ milk substitutes are being used unnecessarily in many <span class="highlight">children</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the point also that, if these substitutes are being used unnecessarily in respect of many <span class="highlight">children</span>, they are being used because medical practitioners are prescribing these cows’ milk substitutes for the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It probably will mean that some <span class="highlight">children</span> will not be able to continue on the cows’ milk substitutes, although they really should, because of their cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it finds that the substitutes are being used unnecessarily for many <span class="highlight">children</span> perhaps there could be a way around this so that the cows ‘ milk substitutes could be provided for those who really need them, for those whose allergy is permanent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not disagree with the honourable senator’s statement that there are some <span class="highlight">children</span> who may need the drugs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What he did not say is why any older <span class="highlight">children</span> need to stay on milk substitutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most <span class="highlight">children</span> can get on perfectly well without milk at all particularly after a certain age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not saying that my <span class="highlight">children</span> do not drink a great amount of milk, but I am suggesting to  Senator Colston  that it is not logically correct to say that it is an essential kind of foodstuff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make the point that this Committee has acted, I think, in line with available knowledge, that there is no good evidence that milk or milk substitutes are necessary for older <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be expensive for families if it is decided that <span class="highlight">children</span> who suffer from the allergy require to stay on the list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is generally possible, if one investigates these <span class="highlight">children</span> thoroughly, to know whether this kind of product is needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am not prepared to say, on the evidence I have about milk allergy, whether it is to lactose, protein or the penicillin which is sometimes in milk, that there is a good case for these products to continue to be available for older <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They probably have been prescribed for <span class="highlight">children</span> of a much older age group than that for which they should be prescribed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly agree with  Senator Baume  that it is possible to prove scientifically in many cases that some <span class="highlight">children</span> do need a milk substitute and that some do not need a milk substitute; but most of us who practise in this country just are not able to do this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly most of the evidence is anecdotal and I agree that that is not very scientific; but it will be very difficult to prove to me, to other people in general practice in isolated areas and to the parents of the <span class="highlight">children</span> with asthma and in more usual cases with abdominal conditions and eczema whom we see improve so much after they go on to cows’ milk substitutes that this is not effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the evidence is not scientific and is not based on all sorts of scientific tests, the effect of putting these <span class="highlight">children</span> back on milk at five, six, seven or eight years of age is sometimes quite dramatic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly milk is not an essential food for <span class="highlight">children</span> of this age group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I accept that we probably feed our <span class="highlight">children</span> too much milk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just hope that the whole thing can be looked at again carefully and some formula worked out so that <span class="highlight">children</span> who do need it at a much older age- I am sure there are such <span class="highlight">children</span>- can be catered for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fair to say that in the statement which was made by the Minister he said that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee considered that alternative sources of protein are available to <span class="highlight">children</span> over the age of 1 8 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who were being hurt were the ones who were really threatened by unemployment; the ones who were threatened by inflation; the ones whose <span class="highlight">children</span> had virtually no prospect of entering employment once they left school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember that  Senator Walters  said something about the need for an increase in child endowment to enable women to stay at home, if they so choose, to look after their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their theory was to arrange the economy so that it would be just about impossible for a family to subsist on one wage and, by doing so, men and women would be discouraged from having <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This idea was based, of course, on the fact that if a woman has to take a full time job and has to take the full family responsibilities that she might have if she did not hold a job she would be discouraged from having <span class="highlight">children</span> because <span class="highlight">children</span> would be a burden to her and would be a burden to the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the assumption that if a woman gets pleasure out of the job of being wife and mother, if she gets satisfaction from the job of raising <span class="highlight">children</span>, if she wants to stay in the home, as we call it, and perform a very particular duty there, she ought to feel guilty and that there is something inhuman or unnatural about making a decision of that type. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It costs more when the mother goes to work as well as the father, particularly when special arrangements need to be made for the care of the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to simple matters like making clothes for the <span class="highlight">children</span>, amongst other things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would not force such a large number of our <span class="highlight">children</span> to be latchkey <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time other things are happening in our society which are making it more and more difficult for the 2 parent family where one parent is caring for the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increase of 6.4 per cent will be applied to the basic rate of the pension and not to any supplementary benefits or to any <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowances that are paid at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have the case of a 36-year old cleaner with a wife and 3 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But with the advent of Medibank the medical practitioner has been able to have a pathology test or an X-ray made immediately if there is any doubt, particularly in the case of <span class="highlight">children</span>, instead of the patient’s having to wait for up to a fortnight or 3 weeks before these tests could be carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The difficulties of travel, the difficulties of isolation and, in particular, the difficulties of educating their <span class="highlight">children</span> make doctors reluctant to go to such centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This meant that hundreds and hundreds of <span class="highlight">children</span> and young students in outer Belconnen who would have been ready the next year for schools ranging from pre-schools to technical schools would have had no accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Although I express satisfaction that the Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick)  saw fit to visit this area and recommend this minimal funding, there was really no other decision he could have taken, I suggest, because otherwise <span class="highlight">children</span> from pre-school age to technical school agc would have been sitting in the gutters or waiting at home because they had nowhere to go to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope he will give us an assurance in the very near future that the ordinance setting up the Authority legally and giving it the quite modest delegated powers to set about the business of running the schools efficiently in the interests of the <span class="highlight">children</span> will be passed as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, since  Senator Walters’  question in the Senate, the organisers of the Tattoo have announced a special daytime performance for <span class="highlight">children</span> on Friday, 26 March. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister for Social Security accept that in the community there are many women who are bringing up <span class="highlight">children</span> on their own and who, at the moment, arc struggling to make ends meet on the supporting mother’s benefit? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does she accept that many of these women have no current qualifications which would lead to constant employment at a wage which would enable them to bring up their <span class="highlight">children</span> in a life-style similar to that of the majority of the rest of the community? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These committees are the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the Senate and the Senate should never allow them to escape without some sort of control over them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a section of that publication entitled Eating Little <span class="highlight">Children</span>’, it was maintained that we in the West, by our huge consumption of meat, were depriving the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the poorer countries of the cereals that would save them from dying of malnutrition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it strikes me as sadly ironical that we permit those kinds of lobbies to exist in our country- we permit people to express a range of views on subjects such as population control in our own country- and yet people like  Senator Sheil  look at the Third World countries and say, They have too many <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, this meant that the people who use bus services- <span class="highlight">children</span>, housewives doing their shopping, elderly people, people who cannot afford cars, students and teenagers- had no way of getting from one place to another except if they could afford a taxi. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When some of them stagger out of bed at 6 o’clock in the morning, get <span class="highlight">children</span> off to school, do the chores, go to work, come home, look after the family and then fall into bed, it is time unions, employers and governments looked at what amounts to not much more than slave labour for a great percentage of this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Government to look at this matter as a matter of great priority: There are women being trained under the NEAT scheme who have lived on the supporting mother’s benefit for a long time or who, if they have not lived on the supporting mother’s benefit, have done menial jobs in the community- scrubbed floors, taken in washing and kept house for other people- to provide the sort of income they need to enable them to keep their <span class="highlight">children</span> as best they can under the same conditions as those enjoyed by the rest of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If you have young <span class="highlight">children</span>, be able to satisfy the employer that they will not unduly take your attention from your job or make you an unreliable worker; the employer may wish to be assured that you have made adequate arrangements for the care of your <span class="highlight">children</span> while you are working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I once met a young woman with 5 young <span class="highlight">children</span> whose husband was dying of a debilitating disease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She realised that if she was going to look after those <span class="highlight">children</span> by herself for the rest of their lives and give them all the care that she and her husband would have otherwise given them she would have to gain some qualifications that would enable her to take up some work that would allow her to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The gentleman interviewing her said to her: I realise that you need to have qualifications, but you are young and have 5 <span class="highlight">children</span> now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Do you think that you will have more <span class="highlight">children</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interviewer persisted and asked her how she knew that there was no likelihood that she would have more <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally she said: ‘I have had an hysterectomy; so I cannot have any more <span class="highlight">children</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For demographic purposes, fertility is a measure of the actual numbers of <span class="highlight">children</span> born, not the ability to bear <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are people who suggest that Australians should be encouraged to have more <span class="highlight">children</span> as a substitute for immigration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this argument overlooks is the long-standing decline in completed family size in Australia from an average of over 6 <span class="highlight">children</span> in the 1 880s to about three in the 1 940s and to below three more recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we include the <span class="highlight">children</span> born to migrants after arrival, some 3.7 million of the total 6.2 million increase in Australia’s population since World War II is due directly to migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether in the past we have not been too preoccupied with tertiary education and have not concentrated enough on proper teacher training at the pre-school, primary, secondary and technical levels in order to encourage <span class="highlight">children</span> into a work area where they will be most happy and where their particular IQ or talents will enable them to fulfil a job that will bring them satisfaction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One could find that if the unpaid housekeeper of a family unit is incapacitated for any length of time necessitating the employment of a replacement it may be necessary to employ a person with one or more <span class="highlight">children</span> who would be solely dependent on the taxpayer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am concerned about the situation where people are caring for women who find it necessary, generally in the middle of the night, to leave their matrimonial home, quite often in a distressed state and quite often accompanied by <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Up to the present I think that about 500 women and more than 1500 <span class="highlight">children</span> have been turned away from the refuge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, it is felt that refuges for women and <span class="highlight">children</span> made homeless by domestic conflict are funded under the community health program which is administered by the Hospitals and Health Services Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It appears to us that there are various important reasons for the public, including <span class="highlight">children</span>, to have buses at the weekend and as Belconnen is poorly catered for us kids. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It’s very hard on <span class="highlight">children</span> not to have buses because we have to get our parents to drive us or we have to hitch-hike which can be dangerous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does he agree that such action could lead to school <span class="highlight">children</span> becoming the unwilling recipients of a vast proliferation of propaganda material, that school <span class="highlight">children</span> should not be so badgered, and that such action could seriously impair their reaching an objective assessment of the various political groupings in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, one had to be resident in Australia for at least 3 years; to be married, or to be widowed or divorced with dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>; to be under the age of 36; and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We could use all of those trained teachers in New South Wales and more if we were prepared to reduce class sizes, to provide a lot of specialist attention for <span class="highlight">children</span> who need it and to train some of those teachers to teach migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> who need very specialised attention in their first year or 2 years in Australian society, if they are to get on an equal footing with their Australian born peers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even if educational institutions as they now exist can accommodate all the <span class="highlight">children</span> coming from schools in the next 1 5 or 20 years there is still the very serious matter of those persons who at this time are adult and have virtually no education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has also been suggested that <span class="highlight">children</span> of these people are deliberately bringing them out to Australia so that after a very short period they can return to their own countries and thereafter be paid Australian welfare benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The answer to the second part of the question, which suggested that <span class="highlight">children</span> of these people may be deliberately bringing them to Australia so that they will qualify for benefits, is something on which I am not prepared to comment without an investigation or substantiation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In relation to delays in the finality of these matters, it should be understood that many of these <span class="highlight">children</span> arrive without papers and without the necessary documentation which would facilitate early adoption procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>3) 1974 was being debated,  Senator Guilfoyle  moved an amendment in the following words:   but the Senate is of the opinion that the Government should consent to the incorporation in it of a provision making widowers and deserted husbands with dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> eligible for benefit on the same basis as widows and deserted wives. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Prior to the formation of the Budget I spoke in the Senate of the hope that I had that it would be possible this year to assist supporting fathers and the <span class="highlight">children</span> in those families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would have thought that if  Senator Guilfoyle  had had her way at the time something would have been done for deserted fathers and more importantly something would have been done for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of those families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only has the Minister forgotten the sentiments expressed regarding deserted fathers and their <span class="highlight">children</span> by making no provision whatsoever for them in the measures before us this afternoon, the Minister has gone out of her way to penalise the innocent <span class="highlight">children</span> of pensioners by ignoring them and depriving them of a justifiable increase in the dependants allowance which would have cost something less than $lm for the rest of the fiscal year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But why has the Government denied the flow on of the increase to dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> of those pensioners? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Figures available at 30 June 1975 show that eligible for the dependants’ allowance were 9858 <span class="highlight">children</span> of age pensioners; 46 269 <span class="highlight">children</span> of invalid pensioners; 138 867 <span class="highlight">children</span> of widows; and 5956 <span class="highlight">children</span> of supporting mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What of the disgraceful action in denying a flow on to dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> of pensioners of the cost of living adjustment of 6.4 per cent to save a paltry $lm this fiscal year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we look at the position of widows with <span class="highlight">children</span>, the amount of money they are allowed to earn and the amount we graciously give them as a pension, we could easily believe that no honourable senator opposite ever had to face up to the costs of educating, feeding and clothing <span class="highlight">children</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But here we have a band of professional women who do what is probably the most important job in this country, that of bringing up our <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government leaves them in terror and fear as to what will happen to them and to their <span class="highlight">children</span>, and it leaves them with an infinitesimal amount of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regardless of the argument that that is rubbish because once we are dead it does not matter, obviously as people get closer to the age when they might die they have a passion to be buried with decency; not to be buried in a pauper’s grave; and not to have their house sold to pay for the funeral; nor to have their <span class="highlight">children</span> go into debt to pay for the funeral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, we never know when we might suddenly be in a position where our husband or wife has vanished, where our job has suddenly folded up or where our husband or wife is dead and we have <span class="highlight">children</span> to support, bills to pay, food to buy and rent to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> and other allowances are concerned I would agree that any benefit that can be given at this time would be appropriate to be given in order to pass on the increases that have resulted from inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it possible to consider some steps to ensure that these unused places are filled to avoid the need for more expensive capital works and to ensure that the funds available provide for the maximum number of <span class="highlight">children</span> to obtain care in areas where there may already be existing child care facilities which are commercially operated but not fully utilised? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition had hoped that, in drawing up new legislation, the Government would have taken account of the anomaly, which seems to be almost discrimination based on class, whereby orphaned <span class="highlight">children</span> of 16 years who are fulltime students may continue to draw a pension from their deceased parents’ superannuation but orphaned <span class="highlight">children</span> of 16 years who go into the work force or, more significantly, wish to take an apprenticeship do not continue to have an entitlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that members of the Government are aware that many single parents, particularly single mothers, are pursuing a Public Service career particularly because it offers job security and therefore security for their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been contacted by single mothers who are concerned that the failure of the legislation to provide benefits for <span class="highlight">children</span> over 16 years might mean that their own <span class="highlight">children</span>, if orphaned, would be in a very invidious position, and I hope that the Government will set about rectifying that anomaly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If she has no such ability and if she has dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>, I would agree with  Senator Walters  that she should not be excluded from having some claim on the pension of her former spouse, a pension to which undoubtedly she has contributed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill also provides for a break in service for the female public servant if she wishes to withdraw from the work force for a number of years to have <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are improved benefits for the spouse of a deceased contributor and the <span class="highlight">children</span> and orphans of contributors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The new scheme provides benefits for  de jure  and  de facto  spouses and <span class="highlight">children</span> living with the scheme member at the time of death or, if not living with the member, if they were substantially dependent on the member at the time of death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have looked at the questions raised by Senators Walters and Ryan on the eligibility conditions for spouses and <span class="highlight">children</span>’s benefits, and these are the same as the conditions contained in the Bill which was introduced last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The principle is not a new one insofar as spouses’ and <span class="highlight">children</span>’s benefits are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past when improvements in spouses’ and <span class="highlight">children</span>’s benefits have been payable under the superannuation legislation they have been passed on to the persons already in receipt of benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the Government’s action is responsible for a severe increase in the cost of cows’ milk substitutes which penalise parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> aged eighteen months and over who have a medical need for these substitutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for Social Security why the administration of some 59 projects for <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services totalling, I believe, about $1.2m, was removed from the Victorian office of the Interim Committee for the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission which had the expertise and the confidence of groups in Victoria to deal with such projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If no such assurances can be given, will the Minister consider returning the administration of these projects to the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission so that the money can be spent in the way in which it was intended? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question that has been directed to me shows a misunderstanding of the arrangements with regard to the funding of projects from the Interim Committee for the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Interim Committee for the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission in Melbourne together with the office in Canberra, has the same responsibility for these projects as it always has had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The responsibility for and final approval of projects still rest with the Interim Committee for the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the community groups concerned have an active and constant communication with the Interim Committee of the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Health aware of a recent program broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Commission regarding a  Dr Feingold  and the diet treatment that he has formulated for hyperactive <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that the ABC was deluged with requests from the public, mostly from parents of hyperactive <span class="highlight">children</span>, for copies of this diet? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the Minister agree that this response indicates that there is an urgent need for medical research into the problem of hyperactive <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister inform the chamber whether the Government, through its funding of appropriate research bodies, will facilitate research into the diagnosis and treatment of hyperactive <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no knowledge of the subject to which the question is related but I agree with the honourable senator that research into the matter of dietary or other treatment for hyperactive <span class="highlight">children</span> would be desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am unaware whether any research is being conducted in this area, but I am aware of the difficulties that parents have in dealing with the question of education and the other matters which relate to <span class="highlight">children</span> suffering from this condition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A majority of schools in Aboriginal communities now incorporate in their programs the teaching of aspects of Aboriginal culture and the use of teaching assistants who can use the local language or dialect for communication with <span class="highlight">children</span> and the local community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A complete program develops and maintains the <span class="highlight">children</span>’s selfesteem and legitimate pride in both cultures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not many years ago that <span class="highlight">children</span> were punished for using their own language in the school and in the playground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No Aboriginal culture was included and the idea seemed to be that the <span class="highlight">children</span> should be made as much like Europeans as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aboriginal artists were paid to teach the <span class="highlight">children</span> dancing and singing in their own language and their own culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>European <span class="highlight">children</span> are taking part in the non-sacred corroborees- the play corroborees and even our balandas are learning to play the didgeridoo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me, and I am sure to many people of my race, this is perhaps one of the most exciting and most important measures ever taken with regard to the education of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this because for far too long the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> in the urban and rural areas unfortunately have lost their own tongue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this difficulty must be doubled or trebled for the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> who live in a tribal or semi-tribal state and who speak or who have learned to speak nothing other than their own tongue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could appreciate surely the confusion in the minds of these infants who go to school and have to learn a foreign language which is entirely different from their own and have to try to be educated to the standard that we all surely would like to see the <span class="highlight">children</span> being educated to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, it meant the ending of federal funding of per capita grants which made pocket money for the wealthy in Australia and statistics of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the poor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, it meant a striving towards decent, basic minimum standards for Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>, whatever their origins and wherever they might happen to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am much less critical of the educational lobby that exists in relation to school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It believes that the needs of all <span class="highlight">children</span> in all schools should be considered in a total pattern as has been attempted in recent years, particularly through the Schools Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If cuts have to be made in education, we hope that in making those cuts the Government will be diligent to ensure that the cuts are so made as to protect the most needy in Australia; that they protect the most needy <span class="highlight">children</span>; that they protect the most needy schools; that they protect the most disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my introductory remarks I would like to address some attention to the sentiment quite often expressed of late by some government supporters, that money does not buy a good education, that a lot of the money allocated through the Schools Commission programs has been wasted and that we must look to other means to improve the educational standards of our <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say in rebuttal to this that money can improve the educational opportunities of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, money provided by way of Schools Commission grants has improved the educational opportunities of many <span class="highlight">children</span> throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the programs are in their infancy, but nonetheless there is evidence to show that these specific programs which have been formulated by experts consulting with all interested parties have led to the development of better educational opportunities for <span class="highlight">children</span> and have demonstrated that where more money, particularly more federal money, is available benefits can be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But of course, the provision of ancillary staff requires money, and again we are back to my first contention, that if we are to improve the standard of education available to Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> we must be prepared to spend money on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware that the Senate has a committee which has conducted such national inquiries and is continuing to conduct one into the provision of educational services for isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again it sounds almost like a cliche, but is something which is still far off for most Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator did mention the case of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year I put to the previous Minister for Education,  Mr Beazley,  personally and in a debate on educational matters in the Senate that there were particular needs in the area of education of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> of which and to which the Government was ignorant and unresponsive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is simply that some <span class="highlight">children</span> in very isolated areas of Australia can conduct their studies only by correspondence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So a number of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> could not get their correspondence lessons because their parents could not afford to pay $27 a week for the privilege of a once-a-week mail service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard much about buildings that are too crowded, buildings that are too cold or too hot, too many <span class="highlight">children</span> per teacher and so on, but what of the student who has no education at all? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the problem faced by many isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I point out to  Senator Ryan,  as a particuarly strong defender of the Schools Commission, that in the Commission’s report on the triennium 1976-78 there is a special section reporting the problems of education of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But many people would dispute that the money has necessarily been well spent; that the needs have necessarily been well identified; that there has been a weighing up against other areas of need of the sorts of problems that I mentioned in relation to isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> who have no education available to them at all, let alone sufficient education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">children</span> come to the school with particular problems as a result of that and are affected by the open plan school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the surveys are still fairly new at this stage, but the preliminary results show that in reaction to a total open plan system, given this group of <span class="highlight">children</span>, the <span class="highlight">children</span> did not identify with anybody in the school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given a personally and socially deprived background, but not a financially deprived background, given a particular sort of deprivation of relationship to teachers in the classroom these <span class="highlight">children</span>, these potential future citizens, are going to carry with them a liability which, for all we know, they may never be able to overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one criticism of old school buildings, but in each case the teachers in those schools told me that they were less concerned about that than about the fact that there were students at the school whose parent or parents were so poorly off that the <span class="highlight">children</span> did not have pencils and paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">children</span> were to have those sorts of basic educational equipment then the teachers had to buy them out of their own pockets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are others who have a knee-jerk reaction: Our <span class="highlight">children</span> will be better off because we will be able to say that this is more necessary than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">children</span> will be better off because we are going to be able to participate in the running of schools, and we do not like everything that is going on in the schools’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the particular aspect of the education of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> that I mentioned earlier, I say again to  Senator Ryan  that it is possible that one of the reasons that the Commonwealth Government was not aware of that problem is that it occurs in just a couple of far-flung areas of Australia- north-west Queensland and northern Western Australia in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the small State Government per capita payments- the smallest in Australia- and the inter-relationship of these payments with what is known as the SRRI- the Schools Recurrent Resources Index- the parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> at non-government schools in Tasmania will receive under the provisions of this Bill approximately  a  quarter of  a  million dollars less than they should receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But on this occasion I am convinced that the headmasters are correct and that parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> at independent schools in Tasmania are doubly disadvantaged principally because of the low level of State Government assistance in Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They see that the hopes for their <span class="highlight">children</span> and for the people in their districts rest with the education received in the schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span> no longer go to school to learn the 3 Rs, as one honourable senator referred to them yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to mention some of the broad difficulties that face country <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: Will the Government in its Budget deliberations, pending the abolition of estate duty, consider that the removal of the duty should apply not only to the surviving spouse but ultimately to surviving <span class="highlight">children</span>, and that the shadow of this severe tax, plus the uncertainty of expectation of life, puts any form of investment in industry and commerce in people ‘s later years at risk? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The decision to place the <span class="highlight">children</span> in Fannie Bay gaol was the magistrate’s and was in keeping with a recent trend adopted by the magistrate to ensure that <span class="highlight">children</span> who appeared before the court were brought face to face with the possible consequences of breaking the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The priority given to reuniting spouses and dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> with their families followed by other close relatives has been that adopted by the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>As the weekly equivalent of the present maximum taxation rebate is $3.85 in respect of most <span class="highlight">children</span>, the overall position of families able to take full advantage of these rebates at present will not be greatly changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those families and the <span class="highlight">children</span> of those families I am sure will remember tonight for 2 particular reasons- our attitude and that of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The full year cost of taxation rebates for dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> and students, had they been indexed in 1976-77, together with the cost of the present child endowment scheme, would have amounted to about $l.,025m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a slightly higher range in which, given the fact that the persons concerned may have dependantssay, a wife and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>- their normal deductions at income tax time would cover whatever tax they would pay on that additional payment from the Government for the rest of the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is particularly important in the case of the many families in Australia where young <span class="highlight">children</span> are being reared and where the wife and mother decides that the best role she can play, in relation to the welfare of her family, is to remain at home and not go out into the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst we can personally and politically applaud the increases in child endowment, we have to draw attention to the fact that with removal of the tax deductibility for <span class="highlight">children</span> this does not achieve the very objective which the Government said it sought to achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear to me, for example, that a person with 10 <span class="highlight">children</span> in receipt of average weekly earnings, who would benefit greatly from the child endowment payments, would lose more than he would gain under this new package deal because of the loss of the tax deductions to which he was formally entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the family allowances his wife- I agree that she is the person to whom it ought to go- will receive in respect of her 4 <span class="highlight">children</span> $20.50 a week instead of $5.75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister has already announced that funding for child care services this year will be given a priority because of the very urgent need in most parts of Australia for these support services for families and <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Child endowment has been increased to $3.50 for the first child, going up progressively to $7 for the fifth child and subsequent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, the taxation rebates for dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> which were allowed in the past are going to be abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That will give far greater assistance to poorer families, particularly as the endowment has been increased significantly, while at the same time the dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance for taxation purposes has been abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Generally the unit consists of parents and one or two <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the care of <span class="highlight">children</span>; transport needs, perhaps above all needs in the country; the development of reasonable urban facilities and the preservation of the environment are appropriate matters for discussion, decision and initiative by the national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognised that there were about 800 000 <span class="highlight">children</span> in these families and realised that the whole system of child endowment needed to be restructured so that assistance could be directed to all <span class="highlight">children</span> and to all families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of some families being able to take advantage of a $200 rebate for the first child and a rebate for other <span class="highlight">children</span>, the same allowances will be made for all <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were influenced in this decision very strongly by the poverty report of Professor Henderson which talked of the way in which we could direct assistance to families by abolishing tax rebates, thus enabling a larger amount to be distributed amongst the <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps at this stage we have not accepted the level of allowances which was recommended by his report for the fourth child and subsequent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were influenced by the figures relating to families which have one to three <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of <span class="highlight">children</span> in families which have one child totals 668 000; in families with 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>, 730 000; and in families with 3 <span class="highlight">children</span>, 352 000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This makes a total of 1.7 million <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of <span class="highlight">children</span> in families with four or more <span class="highlight">children</span> total 1 74 000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We realised that 1.7 million <span class="highlight">children</span> would benefit from the greatly increased allowances we gave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also gave heavy increases to those families with four or more <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Significantly too we have been enabled to introduce a greater benefit for student <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In future they will be treated on the same basis as other <span class="highlight">children</span> in the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas at present endowment for a student child is $ 1 .50 a week, in future it will range from $3.50 to $7 a week depending on the position of the child in the family and the number of <span class="highlight">children</span> in the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In future the endowment allowance for student <span class="highlight">children</span> will continue until 25 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the level of support and the desirability for these allowances to be in the hands of the parents responsible for the <span class="highlight">children</span>, we think that a monthly payment would be desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We took the opportunity also to adjust some provisions with regard to nationality qualifications to give effect to certain <span class="highlight">children</span> with alien fathers who were excluded from eligibility for child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is important to me and to my department is that the new benefit will be a help to those families where there is a single breadwinner or perhaps where there is a single parent looking after <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will have support in a way which will enable them to determine how they will meet the needs of their <span class="highlight">children</span> and to decide the priorities which they will give to this expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Something of the greatest importance to developing a proper Australia is provision for the care of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The concessional rebate which is allowable under section 159(r) of the Income Tax Assessment Act in respect of life assurance premiums includes premiums paid by the taxpayer in the year of income for insurance against sickness of or personal injury or accident to the taxpayer or his or her spouse or <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The project’s purpose was therefore to provide soundly based evidence of the performance of certain basic skills of Australian primary and secondary school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The project tested the reading, writing and number skills of 10-year old and 14-year old <span class="highlight">children</span> throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During October 1975, approximately 7000 <span class="highlight">children</span> from each level, at 600 schools, completed the appropriate tests, and answered a short background questionnaire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although, as I shall refer to later, the Government’s new proposals for better and fairer family allowances entails the withdrawal of tax rebates for <span class="highlight">children</span>, this will not exclude them from the basis for calculation of the zone allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1  have spoken elsewhere of the Government’s proposals for an improved scheme of family allowances and pointed out the reasons for the consequential removal of the rebates for maintenance of <span class="highlight">children</span> from the income tax law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should explain that the existing family reunion policies cover spouses, minor dependant <span class="highlight">children</span> and aged or dependant parents of persons already living in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">children</span> will not know what fresh apples and fresh milk tastes like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this Bill it is proposed to increase payments to $3.50 a week for the first child, $5.00 a week for the second child, $6.00 a week for the third and fourth <span class="highlight">children</span> and $7.00 a week for each other child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another significant change proposed is that students will be brought into account in the assessment of the total amount of family allowance payable, as if they were <span class="highlight">children</span> under 16 years of age, and the rate payable for them will be determined according to their position in a family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>$1.50 a week flat, will be increased to a minimum of $3.50 for the eldest or only child in the family; if there are two student <span class="highlight">children</span> in the family the rate payable for the second student will be $5.00 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will overcome the existing anomaly that, upon a child reaching 16 years and becoming a student, the total amount payable increases in one and two child families but decreases in families where there are more than two <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">children</span> of alien fathers will no longer be disqualified on nationality grounds; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most families receive assistance for <span class="highlight">children</span> under 16 years of age and students by way of child endowment and personal income tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the benefits that are available to some taxpayers by way of tax rebates for <span class="highlight">children</span> do not apply to some 300 000 families whose incomes are insufficient to enable them to take advantage of those tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The redistribution of income described is possible as a result of the parallel Government decision to abolish personal income tax rebates for <span class="highlight">children</span> and students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For such families they will more than offset any reduction in assistance for <span class="highlight">children</span> arising from the substitution of increased family allowances for personal income tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The abolition of tax allowances for <span class="highlight">children</span> and large increases in family allowances were recommended by Professor Henderson in the First Main Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increases in family allowances will take effect at virtually the same time as the payasyouearn schedules of tax instalments are adjusted to take account of the withdrawal of rebates for <span class="highlight">children</span> and students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This additional cost will be offset by the abolition of taxation rebates for <span class="highlight">children</span> and students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, relates to the new and increased family allowances which, following on the existing system of child endowment, will be paid to the mother of the child or <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister clarify the position in relation to the payment of the newenefits to the father of the child or <span class="highlight">children</span> where the father has actual and legal custody and maintains the child or <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am able to assure the honourable senator that where a father has the care, custody and control of the child the payment of this benefit, which is a benefit for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australia, will be made to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Firstly, he knew that full tax indexation would be introduced in 1976-77; secondly, that there would be major cuts in specific purpose grants, particularly on the capital works side; thirdly, that the Commonwealth would be raising revenue through the Medibank levy from which the States were excluded and, fourthly, that the Commonwealth proposed to abolish rebates for dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> and to substitute a system of family allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth will abolish rebates for dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>, thus causing personal income tax collections to rise by approximately $750m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are the single person on a median income of 10 per cent below average weekly earnings, the taxpayer on a median income with a dependant spouse and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> and- the taxpayer on average weekly earnings with a dependant spouse and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other 2 notable features for taxpayers with dependant spouse and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> are that there was a significant fall in the proportion of income paid in taxation in 1975-76 pursuant to the introduction of the tax rebate system and that there will be a significant rise in 1976-77 in the proportion of income paid in taxation by taxpayers in those categories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact priority was given to the entry of close relatives, with preference being given to those who were spouses, <span class="highlight">children</span>, parents, fiancees and fiances, and brothers and sisters of Australian residents, including students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I contrast this attitude of the present Opposition with the attitude of some honourable senators opposite when last year we changed the tax deduction for <span class="highlight">children</span> to a tax rebate system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, we are told that these changes balance out, that the increase of $780m in endowment payments is balanced by the gain of $780m in revenue from the cutting out of tax rebates for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, I am sure that every honourable senator has received letters and telephone calls about the problem of the separated or divorced husband who is paying maintenance for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose there may even be some cases of the separated or divorced wife paying maintenance to her former husband for their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people would lose their tax rebate while still paying maintenance to the parent who is looking after the <span class="highlight">children</span> and getting this increased endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that there are people in this country who set up trusts for their <span class="highlight">children</span> to avoid the payment of death duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose the best example of this is the Premier of Queensland who claims that he will not pay any death duties because all his funds are in trust for his <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There seems to be a loss of revenue here and an unnecessary assistance to those who are wealthy enough or skilful enough to put all their money into endowments for their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He recommended increases of this order in child endowment to relieve poverty in families with <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More has been given to the first, second and third <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Less has been given to the fourth and later <span class="highlight">children</span> than Professor Henderson recommended if inflation is taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This recognises the fact which many people forget- that in absolute numbers there are more families in poverty with one or two <span class="highlight">children</span> than with four or five <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this obviously reflects the spread of <span class="highlight">children</span> throughout families in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He recommended many other things, such as the necessity for infant welfare services and protection services for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can argue about quantum, but there is no doubt that there has been provision for the payment of allowances in respect of all <span class="highlight">children</span> in this country for some time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was  Mr Menzies,  as he then was, who in 1941 introduced child endowment for the first time, but at that stage it was payable only in respect of second and subsequent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1964  Mr Menzies’  Government increase the rates of child endowment in respect of third and subsequent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1967 a government of our persuasion again increased the rates of child endowment, but this time in respect of fourth and subsequent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also recommended the abolition of the concessional tax rebates allowable in respect of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, the national average of <span class="highlight">children</span> in a family is 2.7 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can never understand how a family can have seven-tenths of a child; so I will take the case of a taxpayer with a dependent wife and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if the taxpayer happens to be earning $400 a week and has the same dependent wife and 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>, he will gain $10.95. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  say that in actual fact when a father was supporting <span class="highlight">children</span> and established that this was the case, he would receive child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a single father has 2 dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> he will not benefit by the same amount as a person who is on a higher income with 2 dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>; nor will he benefit as much as a person on a lower income with 2 dependant <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think quite frankly that an additional $3 a week will compensate an Aboriginal parent if he or she despairs at their <span class="highlight">children</span>’s health as it deteriorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think, for instance, that the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> who are already suffering because of the previous decision to cut back on the meal program will feel that they are being adequately compensated by getting another $3 in their pockets each week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It relates to <span class="highlight">children</span> under school leaving age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier when touching on this matter very briefly, nothing has been done for single or supporting fathers except that now the Minister has said that payments will be made directly to them if they can establish that they are supporting a child or <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that this Government or any previous government has not done anything to enable a deserted husband, or the father of dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>, to be able to cope more adequately with a situation that leaves a lot to be desired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know of a case where a relatively young man, an unskilled labourer on approximately $100 a week clear, has been left with 3 <span class="highlight">children</span>, two under school age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is now seriously contemplating leaving his position and becoming unemployed so that he can afford to stay at home and look after his <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He may not be able to afford to eat, but he will be able to afford to stay home and look after his <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing in any of the Bills which have come before the Senate from this Government which has made provision for a man in such a position to be able to employ a housekeeper and to pay a housekeeper to live in and to look after his <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill increases the amount of money allocated to families for their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a father of some 7 <span class="highlight">children</span> and having some 20 grandchildren, I believe that I can rightly claim to speak from wide experience in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>See what you can do with it to feed, clothe and educate the <span class="highlight">children</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the scale one sees that a family with one child will receive $3.50 a week and that the amount received by a family with 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> jumps up to $8.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know that they will be able to use the money as they see fit to buy clothes and text books for their <span class="highlight">children</span> and to do all of those things that they have always felt that they would like to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have thought that the people who have been so concerned with women’s rights and the role of women in society, as  Senator Baume  has been, would have remembered the supporting mothers’ benefit which the Labor Government introduced and which for the first time gave mothers a real chance to choose between staying at home and looking after their <span class="highlight">children</span> or parking them somewhere and going out to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Think of people in the outer suburbs of the large cities of this country who in this day and age when we can put a man on the moon do not have sewerage connected to their homes and have to worry about all the things that worry young mothers with small <span class="highlight">children</span> when they do not have sewerage systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Women who are better off have always put the money away for their <span class="highlight">children</span> and they will continue to do the same thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Women who need the money will have to spend it as they have always spent it-on paying the milk bills and the grocer’s bills and buying <span class="highlight">children</span>’s shoes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security and relates to the new arrangements whereby an office of child care has been substituted for the Interim Committee of the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister whether this office will administer and fund only child care or whether it will also comprehend, as did the Interim Committee, other <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services such as toy libraries, services for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>, pre-school centres and activities centres for before and after school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The office of child care will deal with the development of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hoped that more emphasis can be placed on the development of child care facilities, in particular those which are required urgently for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of sole parents, invalid parents, or other groups who urgently require the provision of services for <span class="highlight">children</span> in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the new arrangements that have put child care under the control of the Department of Social Security, can the Minister indicate the role that will be played by the State consultative committees which worked with the Interim Committee for the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the research that has gone into the compilation of this report and the recommendations contained in it are a tribute to the capacity of Professor Watts to the feelings of the Aboriginal people and, in particular, the requirements of their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has opened up opportunities for many Aboriginal and Island <span class="highlight">children</span> to go on to higher studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a fair pocket of resistance on the part of the parents of white <span class="highlight">children</span> attending schools against fully implementing the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also there was the odd headmaster who did not properly assess the <span class="highlight">children</span> as to whether they ought to go on to secondary studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of these things are now disappearing; but throughout the secondary school area and in the late years of primary school there are still pockets where parents themselves are not being made fully aware of the fact that their <span class="highlight">children</span> are entitled to obtain assistance through the Aboriginal secondary grants scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a big problem in Queensland and in fact in some other parts of Australia- but particularly in the Torres Strait area of Queensland- where <span class="highlight">children</span> have to receive their education through teachers who are not properly qualified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is a responsibility of the Federal Government to see that all <span class="highlight">children</span> are given the opportunity to be taught by fully qualified teachers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Professor Watts, some time earlier, spent a considerable time looking at this aspect of teaching Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Recently we have had the unfortunate experience of hearing that the Government intends to cut out the $200,000 for supplementary diets for the 6000 Northern Territory <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This also carries across to the pregnant mother who does not get the right diet so that her <span class="highlight">children</span> will be born healthy and well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that there will come a time in the history of this nation when all people who are underprivileged will be able to ensure that their <span class="highlight">children</span> have every opportunity to achieve a first class education and that the foundation being set in the field of Aboriginal secondary school grants may lay the guidelines by which this can be applied to the whole community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Martin’s  report deals with the more important community services at the health and social welfare interface and covers such major issues as community health services, mental health services, disability and poverty, alcoholism and drug dependence, the health of newborn <span class="highlight">children</span> and infants, family planning, and dental health services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I add that in the future full time students will be treated as dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> with a minimum of assistance to the mother of $ 1 4 a month if those <span class="highlight">children</span> happen to be the only <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just as most working women have <span class="highlight">children</span> and are therefore aware of the needs of families, particularly poor families, and are happy to support an increase in child endowment, so I think we should encourage women who are at present at home with their <span class="highlight">children</span> to think in terms of supporting policies for women who need or wish to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was a radical departure from what had been the attitude of previous governments towards the care and education of young <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have pointed out that, by offering $8.50 to a woman with 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> and a little more to a woman with 3 <span class="highlight">children</span>, the Government really is not offering something comparable to a wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to look for some sort of financial recognition of the productivity of the woman in the home, I hope that it would measure something more than $8.50 for the work involved in caring for 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Other sorts of pressures that caused women to go out to work in the 1 950s and particularly in the 1960s included the fact that Federal funding of education was so low that women felt they had to go to work to be able to improve the educational opportunities of their <span class="highlight">children</span> by sending them to private schools, which they considered at that time to be better, or by supplementing their <span class="highlight">children</span>’s educational resources through the purchase of books, extra lessons, tutoring and things of that kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, with the $ 10 or even $20 a week that a mother will receive by way of child endowment, she cannot buy good education for her <span class="highlight">children</span>; she cannot purchase housing; she cannot get access to community facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The objectives that parents have for their <span class="highlight">children</span> should be those that lead them to undertake the responsibilities that lead to sound education, to adequate health and care and to the other opportunities which only parents are able to make possible for their <span class="highlight">children</span> for their future development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we have that stability in the economy and the expectation of the future remaining less unpredictable than it has been in the past few years, we might then see women accepting responsibilities within the home for a period when they believe that their <span class="highlight">children</span> can benefit from the full time attention that they can give. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to an article in the Brisbane  Courier Mail  of 10 May 1976, in which it is claimed that statistics provided in a paper to be presented by two Brisbane medical practitioners to an international ear disease conference in the United States of America in May indicate that only thirty per cent of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> in Queensland have normal hearing; if so, has the Department of Health undertaken any research that would indicate the extent of ear abnormalities amongst Aboriginal people in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-66-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister indicate whether new legislation may be brought down to replace those parts of the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission Act relating to <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the proposed <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission has now been transferred to the Department of Social Security and as we are anxious to develop services for <span class="highlight">children</span>, we will be looking to whatever needs there are for legislation to enable a very comprehensive service to be developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the decision that, in the case of custody of <span class="highlight">children</span>, the Act was valid only to the extent that it applied to proceedings between the parties to a marriage for the custody of the natural or adopted <span class="highlight">children</span> of both of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The expression child of a marriage has been limited to the natural or adopted <span class="highlight">children</span> of both parties to the marriage, although the existing, wider meaning has been retained for the purposes of section 63- which prevents a divorce becoming absolute unless the court is satisfied as to the welfare of <span class="highlight">children</span> of the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as custody is concerned, the problem of the disputes beyond the reach of the Family Law Act is part of a wider need for uniform State and Territory laws as to custody, including custody and rights of exnuptial <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The problem must not be compounded by allowing young men to enter the industry, as thousands are doing at the moment, and finding themselves at the mercy of the money lenders of this country, with their wives and <span class="highlight">children</span> being forced into work in the dairy and the cowyards Such a situation only brings the industry back to the state in which it was when I grew up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We can provide all sorts of arrangements for the care of <span class="highlight">children</span> on a proper basis, but once we get to the stage where the state not only cares for them but also maintains them, it will take only another few steps before we will be training them and guiding them in their occupations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Anyone who has had a long experience with family law and its operations over the years would know that where there is all this publicity there is no justice, there is no fairness, there is the scarifying of <span class="highlight">children</span> and innocent persons because of newspapers and others- I do not need to name them- which over the years made a lot of money out of the embarrassment of people; and that was a very deliberate thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to custody it has long been realised that it would only be with the support of the States that we could get a situation where exnuptial <span class="highlight">children</span> would be treated in the same way and with the same facilities of the Family Court available to them as are enjoyed by <span class="highlight">children</span> of a marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is greatly appreciative of the problems of isolated families with <span class="highlight">children</span>, particularly families such as those of cattle producers who are suffering doubly because of the dreadful fall in beef prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will be understood that the proposed <span class="highlight">children</span>’s commission of the former Government has now become the office of child care within the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate take note of the Report of the Standing Committee on Education and the Arts on the Education of Isolated School <span class="highlight">Children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the Isolated <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Parents’ Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was my privilege to accept the Association’s invitation to open the annual conference of the Isolated <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Parents’ Association and I was able to speak in some dimension in relation to the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>President of the Isolated <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Parents’ Association,  Mr E.  C. Powne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time I want to express our appreciation to you, the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts, and the staff of that committee, for the work that went into compiling the report on Isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I made the additional point that education should really ensure that all <span class="highlight">children</span> in their growth from a dependent to an independent status in our society should have the opportunity to find their own identity as social beings and that if all these arguments had any weight at all it surely followed that they must be applied to the situation of what we know as isolated school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators will see, the report discusses possible courses of action which might be taken by education authorities at both Commonwealth level and State level so that there can be an alleviation of the educational disadvantage or hardship which is suffered by what we call isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that if these recommendations are implemented they will go a long way towards giving assistance to parents of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>, parents who are endeavouring to give their families the same educational opportunities as other <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the meantime, sentences relating to the taking away of the <span class="highlight">children</span> from the believing parents, are not carried out (see document of the Group of Co-operation). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, in June, the head of the All Soviet OVIR, Vladimir Obidin, explained that the Soviet competent organs would be thoroughly influenced by the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference, in an issue of visas for emigration, but would give out visas only for re-unification with the family, and that the family is only regarded as husband and wife and their unmarried <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This article requires that the parents ‘bring up their <span class="highlight">children</span> in the spirit of moral law of the builders of Communism’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the Soviet Union today many thousands of people are persecuted because of their convictions, both by judicial and extrajuridical means; for their religious beliefs and for their desire to bring their <span class="highlight">children</span> up in the spirit of religion; for reading and circulating- often to only a few acquaintances- literature which is unwelcome to the State, but which in accordance with ordinary democratic practice is absolutely legitimate, e.g. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, growth centres, together with the Australian Assistance Plan, Medibank, the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission and many other schemes, have been abandoned by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Government ‘s action is responsible for a severe increase in the cost of cows’ milk substitutes which penalise parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> aged eighteen months and over who have a medical need for these substitutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That there is an urgent, humane need to restore cows’ milk substitutes to <span class="highlight">children</span> up to six years of age to the schedule of pharmaceutical benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that cows’ milk substitutes be restored to the schedule of pharmaceutical benefits for <span class="highlight">children</span> up to the age of six years as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Families which receive the allowance for <span class="highlight">children</span> received the first cheques on 13 July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition there is provision in the Department’s estimates in relation to the child program which amounts to $691,000 for the provision of materials, conferences, special arrangements for refugee <span class="highlight">children</span> and the Australian Council for Educational Research test development project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What measures are being considered to provide equity to ensure that persons providing services without pay in the communityespecially housewives providing child carehave the right to the long term security of knowing that their <span class="highlight">children</span> will not be disadvantaged should they be injured or sick? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore ask the Minister: Will special attention be given to the education of those departments and officials in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory who apparently either do not know of child abuse or else do not understand the need for proper community monitoring to detect the true incidence of the abuse by adults of defenceless <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Office of Child Care, of course, has programs that give assistance to parents and <span class="highlight">children</span> and which would act towards the prevention of situations which might lead to child abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sorts of services that can be funded, such as emergency care and services for the provision of accommodation for those who require it, may alleviate some of the battered <span class="highlight">children</span> problems we have seen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The second refers to the redistribution in income tax scales in respect of deductions for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The benefit goes from the high income earner to the low income earner with <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 7, in addition to providing for some of the increases in benefits already mentioned, also includes provisions relating to the weekly payments in respect of dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> in both death and incapacity cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry: Is the Minister aware that 10 000 <span class="highlight">children</span> die every day on the Indian sub-continent because there is nothing to supplement their mothers’ milk? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose the people who had the greatest impact were the mothers who appealed to us to do something to allow their <span class="highlight">children</span> to receive a better education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the fact that the Government has decided, as shown in the Budget Papers, to increase the price of a meal taken at a community kitchen on an Aboriginal reserve, will this deprive <span class="highlight">children</span> of impoverished families of the opportunity of partaking of a meal which they now receive? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Senator Martin  said, we have assisted through our new family allowance scheme those 300 000 low income families, with their 800 000 <span class="highlight">children</span>, who previously just did not have sufficient income to benefit from tax rebates for their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will be aware that the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s benefit was first introduced in 1968 under the National Health Act 1953-1968 and was incorporated in the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974 when the Act was passed in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s benefit is payable to an eligible voluntary, religious or charitable organisation, or local governing body, which provides approved residential accommodation for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> who are engaged in training programs The Bill provides for the rate of this benefit in respect of each physically or mentally handicapped child under 16 years of age to be increased from $3.50 a day to $5 a day with effect from 1 November 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present government child care programs are heavily biassed in favour or pre-school programs, 70 per cent of the funds being destined for pre-schools which only provide part-time services for <span class="highlight">children</span> and do not cater for the needs of working parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware, further, of the results of a survey taken on 27 July 1976 of the 6082 <span class="highlight">children</span> attending the 78 Kindergarten Union centres in New South Wales which showed that only 37.42 per cent of <span class="highlight">children</span> meet the Government’s criteria of need? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister accept that, if the federal subsidy is reduced, there is very real doubt that the New South Wales Government will be able to meet the differences and the majority of <span class="highlight">children</span> attending Kindergarten Union centres will be withdrawn? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As early as possible- I hope quite soon- an announcement will be made with regard to future arrangements for the services for <span class="highlight">children</span> through the Office of Child Care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has indulged in pension bashing, the bashing of the blacks and the taking away of things to which our <span class="highlight">children</span> are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Schools are an institution which determine to a very large extent the future of the <span class="highlight">children</span> who pass through them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its main objective and the main objective of the Labor Government in setting it up was to work out a strategy whereby equality of opportunity in education for all Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> could be achieved and could be achieved within a specific period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where does that leave the special programs of the Schools Commission such as the programs for isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>, for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>, for migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> and for disadvantaged girls in the schools system? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So those schools will be able to maintain high standards of education and the <span class="highlight">children</span> attending those schools will continue to gain sound education which will qualify them for higher education or trade education and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the fact that  Senator Guilfoyle,  who is the Minister in charge of child care matters, has repeatedly assured this chamber that her Government will turn its attention to the needs of very young <span class="highlight">children</span> and that there would be an allocation on the basis of need, what do we find? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think it is worth repeating that some 300 000 low income families with 800 000 <span class="highlight">children</span> will benefit most from the dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>’s rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second social reform which we have heard talked about in this place day after day is the increase in the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance from $10 a week to $15 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We remind them that the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance was introduced in December 1973 by a Labor government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it might be useful for this country if the Labor Party, which is supposed to be the friend of the oppressed, came out and supported what is a most substantial reform in favour of 800 000 <span class="highlight">children</span> in the community who are in relatively poor circumstances in the 300 000 families which are in relatively poor circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those of us on the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts investigating the isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>’s reference are very well aware of the problem in country areas where youngsters, having no real prospect of advancement and seeing no further than their local horizons, left school at an early age to do the work that was available in that area- work which needed very little cultural skill- to their great detriment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mothers receiving that letter will not take their <span class="highlight">children</span> to the Medical Service to be examined, to be diagnosed and then to be sent to the chemist because they would not have the money to pay for the prescriptions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without temporary accommodation the mother and her <span class="highlight">children</span> are sometimes unable to avoid these difficult circumstances, the continuity and security so essential for any family is often disrupted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To conclude, the provision of hostels is not an isolated activity which can be increased or decreased at will because the effectiveness of so much other Aboriginal Affairs expenditure relates to or hinges upon of all such programs to the Aboriginal community would improve measurably with a continuity of hostel acquisition particularly as it relates to other government outlays on Aboriginal employment and training, secondary and study grants, alcoholic rehabilitation, hospital and health services and the care of young <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe there was some suggestion that thousands of people in Australia, particularly <span class="highlight">children</span>, would have impaired sight following the transit on that day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I want my private doctor, my family doctor who has taken care of me, my wife and my <span class="highlight">children</span>, my doctor who I am confident will be able to look after me when I am in hospital, I have that right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was an extremely efficient procedure and it was extremely popular with the public and extremely welcome to low income earners or families with a lot of <span class="highlight">children</span> who had difficulties making on the spot cash payments which many private doctors demand these days and which, no doubt, they will demand even more now that they know every person will be insured and will be able to obtain a refund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has he seen reports of a statement by the  President  of the Australian Teachers Federation that by the end of this year a quarter of a million <span class="highlight">children</span> will be taught in one-room portable classrooms and that no new libraries, art classrooms or general purpose classrooms will be built over the next financial year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To be eligible for the sole parent rebate of $350 the single parent must have the sole care of a dependent child or <span class="highlight">children</span>, that is, there must be at least 2 people in the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government is not telling them and did not tell them that the combined effect of the loss of the <span class="highlight">children</span> ‘s rebate, which we accept along with the family allowances scheme, plus the Medibank levy in fact will put them out of pocket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1974 under the previous taxation schedules taxpayers could deduct amounts for a dependent wife, dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>, medical costs, council and water rates, superannuation, education and a lot of other expenses from their taxable income before the imposition of the levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a husband and wife with a combined income up to $4,299 are to be exempted from paying the levy, surely a single parent should be able to earn up to that level of exemption when supporting either dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> under 16 years of age or dependent students under 25 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If one examines the Budget Papers in relation to family allowances it is clear that about $700m extra will be spent on family allowances this year but, on the other hand, about $700m will be saved because dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> will no longer be allowable as a tax deduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is much more likely that some of the States will decide that there ought to be State courts operating with a full jurisdiction and that they therefore should be able to deal with <span class="highlight">children</span> whether they be legitimate or illegitimate, deal in cases involving property, whether that property is involved in the marriage or not, and deal with rights to maintenance by illegitimate <span class="highlight">children</span> so that <span class="highlight">children</span> are not distinguished in their dealings with the courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Included in those allowances will be both the tertiary allowance referred to by  Senator Davidson  and the isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allow.ance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The interdepartmental committee which was considering the matter and which has made a report to the Government had the benefit of the Senate standing committee’s report on isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The normal migration entry criteria would apply and spouses, dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> and parents of the evacuees would be eligible for migrant entry if they satisfied health and character requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister for Science aware of the increasing number of reports, articles and statements by scientists, nutritionists and medical commentators drawing attention to additives, preservatives and the like, being included in food and drinks consumed by <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that such additives have a negative effect on young <span class="highlight">children</span> and that hyperactivity in <span class="highlight">children</span> is a direct result of adulterated food and drink and that the <span class="highlight">children</span>’s health is therefore undermined? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is understandable that the temporarily reduced funds for housing alarmed and worried many people, not least those Aboriginals in need of housing, for without adequate housing there can be only limited improvements in health, limited opportunity for <span class="highlight">children</span> to succeed at school and limited hope of gaining regular employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As from 1 October 1976 the following persons normally resident in the Lebanon will be eligible to come to Australia, after meeting normal health and character requirements: Spouses and dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australian residents: Parents, both aged and dependent and those who are non dependent and of working age, of Australian residents; nominated brothers and sisters of Australian residents; persons eligible under the normal acceptable occupations list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The lack of adequate medical facilities and the complete absence of Health Education and paramedical services is a tragedy for the St Albans population which is comprised of about eighty per cent (80 per cent) migrants arrived within the last five years and with an overall majority of mothers and young <span class="highlight">children</span> for whom the proposed Community Health Centre would provide an essential service in this underprivileged area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That whereas the world is currently witnessing the slaughter of Africans, many of them school <span class="highlight">children</span>, who are protesting against Apartheid; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to reports claiming that the practice of petrol sniffing is becoming a major drug addiction problem among Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> and adolescents in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am aware that petrol sniffing is not a new problem involving Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consequently I am very conscious of the dangers that will be presented, particularly to <span class="highlight">children</span>, on 23 October when the next eclipse will occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister for Social Security clarify the present position of the Australian Capital Territory Consultative Committee, which was established under the former <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission, whose functions have now been transferred to the Child Care Office in the Department of Social Security? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are to be any changes with regard to the activity and manner of working I will make an announcement, but at present the arrangements are as they were established under the proposed <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commissionthat is, that it is an advisory body and will continue to act as such unless we decide that any other manner of working would be of greater advantage to the work that needs to be done by the Office of Child Care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Labor Government assumed office in 1972 no provision was made for isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>’s grants and no provision for isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>’s grants was made in the Budget that was passed by the previous Government before the election in December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this did not deter or prevent the Labor Government in January 1973 announcing isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowances ranging from a basic allowance of $350 a year to $ 1 ,004, according to means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister and the present Government were convinced about the inadequacy of the tertiary student allowance when they assumed office, they could have acted as speedily as did the Labor Government in relation to isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>’s grants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of the secondary allowance scheme to assist families to keep <span class="highlight">children</span> at high school the maximum allowance has been increased by only $100 whilst the maximum family income to attract the full allowance has been increased from $4,300 to only $5, 1 50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They need this educational assistance and if they do not get it there will be <span class="highlight">children</span> who will be forced to drop out of school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I stand here for the parents with <span class="highlight">children</span> of school leaving age who are confused and very worried about the prospects of only 6 out of every 10 school leavers in 1977 getting a job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-This Bill, which amends the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act, has the effect of increasing the rate of the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s benefit from $3.50 a day to $5 a day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None the less the increases will be welcomed by those charitable, religious and voluntary agencies which are eligible to receive payments under this legislation and which care for many of the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>State institutions which care for these <span class="highlight">children</span> have long waiting lists and this often throws the burden onto the non-governmental agencies which may be caring for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of people in some financial difficulty through unemployment, sickness or lowered incomes, in depressed industries such as the rural industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any case smaller, perhaps more residential type of accommodation, is considered preferable by many of us, I am sure, to accommodate handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> of various types. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly a more appropriate sort of unit for those <span class="highlight">children</span> who need residential and institutional type care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government introduced the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance which was payable to the parents of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> who cared for them at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was introduced in December 1975 and this form of care is often the preferable form of care for many <span class="highlight">children</span> with handicaps. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of some assistance, but there will still remain a need for suitable residential care and suitable residential accommodation for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the difficulties is to know how many <span class="highlight">children</span> need this care and how to plan for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Future plans for the care of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>- and handicapped adults for that matterin our community in particular depend very much on having an accurate assessment of the size and the type of the problem that we face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That item is the very benefit mentioned in this Bill- the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This plan was introduced in either late 1974 or early 1975 and included in it was the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance which will be the subject of legislation later in this session. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s benefit in 1974 was doubled from $ 10.50 a week to $2 1 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Budget the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance is increased by SO per cent, and certainly we will not oppose that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s benefit is increased by some 40 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe also that the Government should be mindful of the importance of community involvement in the provision of facilities for the handicapped and, perhaps more importantly, mindful of increasing awareness in the  community of  the problems of the handicapped, of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> and especially the problems of the parents of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We urge the Government to facilitate such planning by obtaining the necessary statistical information that is available from the Bureau of Statistics through the last census and from any other source and that the Government will not rest on the small cash increases in this benefit, important though it is, and in the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Also this year the Fraser Government is providing an increase in the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance of 50 per cent, an increase which was acknowledged by  Senator Grimes  in his contribution, from $ 10 to $ 1 5 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest to the Minister that great care has to be taken with the implementation of these programs by her Department and by State departments which have been funded to carry out certain programs to support handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The figures will be of great assistance in the future in determining programs to meet the needs of <span class="highlight">children</span> and adults with handicaps. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps here I would disagree with  Senator Georges  to the extent that this is not a matter of trying to curtail government expenditure by using voluntary organisations; rather it is by using voluntary organisations that we have that other dimension in the care that can be given to people with handicaps and in the support that can be given to parents of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw his attention to a Press statement which I released on 13 February in which I refuted the allegation made on the previous day by the Leader of the Opposition,  Mr E.  G. Whitlam, that major benefits for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> had been cut by the present Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These payments are made to parents caring for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> in their own home and this financial year these people will get a total of nearly $9m . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>payments of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s benefit, which are made to organisations caring for the <span class="highlight">children</span>, will rise from $890,000 last year to $ 1 .2m in 1 975-76. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I added also that $30m had been allocated for assistance to organisations providing assistance to handicapped people, including <span class="highlight">children</span> in the current financial year- that was last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it should be said again at this stage that we have now embarked upon a program that will be of considerable benefit to handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one of the Bills which I think will be of great benefit to those organisations which are caring for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The abolition of the income tax rebates for dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> and the substitution of higher child endowment has removed the inequity arising from the inability of low income families to take full advantage of the taxation rebates for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were estimated to be some 300 000 such families with 800 000 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Restoration of the income tax rebates to divorced men who are paying maintenance for their <span class="highlight">children</span> would result in the Government paying double assistance in respect of the <span class="highlight">children</span>, as the mothers would also be in receipt of enhanced family allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the cost to revenue which this would involve, the payment of a double benefit to divorced or separated parents in respect of the maintenance of their <span class="highlight">children</span> could hardly be justified while other parents are in receipt of a single benefit <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to criticism from the Victorian Universities and Schools Examination Board Sub-committee on Migrant English to the effect that some Higher School Certificate English essay questions discriminate against migrant and under-privileged <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Sub-committee states that these questions disadvantage migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> because the questions are not recognised as issues in their cultures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister investigate the problem with a view to seeing whether some uniform curricula throughout Australia could be adopted which would place the migrant and under-privileged <span class="highlight">children</span> mentioned in the Victorian report on an equal basis with other students? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will certainly study the report to see whether there is substance in the claim that migrants and under-privileged <span class="highlight">children</span> are being disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer particularly to an article that appeared in the  Australian  last week headed: ‘Adoption battle: <span class="highlight">Children</span> may be left homeless’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761012_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally, I am concerned for the welfare of these <span class="highlight">children</span> while I am their guardian but I would emphasise that adoptions of <span class="highlight">children</span> from Vietnam have been granted in every State with the exception of Queensland where, I am informed, no cases have been presented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761012_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do want to assure the Senate that the adoption of Asian orphans who are in this country is a sensitive and complex matter but one which the Government in all cases wishes to facilitate in the interests of the <span class="highlight">children</span> and their adoptive parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761012_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The decision of the Commonwealth Government, announced on 20 May, to introduce full indexation of personal income tax m the first year, to introduce a Medibank levy and to change child endowment arrangements and income tax rebates for dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> was an example of that Government’s departure from what I believed was a responsibility to consult with the States on matters which might affect their share of personal income tax collections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be that as a result of the activities of the Australian Film Commission and as a result of the activities of the Film and Television School at some distant date in the future the quality of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television in Australia may improve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last year in the Australian Capital Territory the Australian Council of <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Film and Television conducted a survey which showed that the average primary school child watches television for 30 hours a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no doubt that consumers of the prestige arts organisations in Australia are priviliged and that the <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australia are grossly underprivileged in what they consume and in what might be described as their cultural  milieu. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In practical terms this means that many women and <span class="highlight">children</span> who would have been able to seek assistance from refuges will not have that source of assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I submit to the Senate that the provision of normal welfare type services, normal welfare type housing for families in distress, homes for <span class="highlight">children</span> and so on is a much more expensive operation than the subsidisation of women’s refuges for a few thousand dollars a year to enable them to provide the sort of assistance that they do provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Or has the Federal Government abandoned the refuges because of lack of concern by it about the particular kinds of distressed women and <span class="highlight">children</span> who find themselves in refuges? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Minister must know that many refuges currently giving vital assistance to thousands of women and <span class="highlight">children</span> throughout Australia will close down in the next few months if they do not receive assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister consider that the reduced allocation of funds for child care in the recent Lynch Budget and the reduced resources for planning and administration following the abolition of the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission, will enable the mounting of a child care program adequate to meet the needs of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of these 285 000 women who wish to exercise their choice of undertaking paid employment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What was said about the depletion of resources for planning and administration following the transfer of that matter to the Department of Social Security instead of its remaining as an interim committee of the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission, was not accurate because all officers were transferred to the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These measures provide for pension and benefit increases in line with the consumer price increases for the March and June quarters of this year; they introduce a form of indexation for pensions and benefits; they provide for an increase in the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance; they provide for a change in the means test on pensions and benefits from an income and assets basis to a pure income basis; and they provide for changes to confirm the payment of unemployment benefits on a fortnightly basis rather than a weekly basis and changes in the daily rate of those benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The second topic which arises from this legislation about which I wish to speak is the problem of the dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An amendment to this legislation in April or May of this year also mentioned dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span> who are dependent on pensioners are in a very parlous state in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many reports, including the Henderson Report on Poverty, have pointed out that families with <span class="highlight">children</span> dependent on benefits and pensions are at a considerable disadvantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party has always been concerned about the <span class="highlight">children</span> of these pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators know, the Labor Government when in office increased the dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance to $7.50 per child a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We feel that if an argument can bc made to index the general pension twice yearly on the basis of movements in the consumer price index there is an argument also to increase allowances paid to <span class="highlight">children</span> who are dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arguments have been put, I know, that the new family allowance scheme somehow makes it unnecessary to increase dependent childrens allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But those who receive the dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance have needs other than those experienced by the <span class="highlight">children</span> of those persons on a regular wage who are not dependent on the Government for pensions and benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a time of housing shortage and depression in the building industry with costs increasing for this group of people, many with <span class="highlight">children</span>, I suggest that these people deserve support and deserve to be protected in the same way as the Government is attempting to protect other pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has decided also not to increase unemployment and sickness benefits for <span class="highlight">children</span> under the age of 1 8 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe in the principle that <span class="highlight">children</span> under the age of 1 8 years should receive a lesser benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe, as one member of the Government from his statement in the other House apparently believes, that these <span class="highlight">children</span> are the responsibility of their parents and should not receive any benefits at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We support the increase in the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think that sort of attention should have been paid to the other <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless they crawl and take some sort of side benefit, their <span class="highlight">children</span> have to pay the same price for a school uniform and for school books. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the groups of people who are more likely to suffer because when their <span class="highlight">children</span> leave school this year the <span class="highlight">children</span> will not be entitled to receive the unemployment benefit for 3 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the people whose <span class="highlight">children</span> are most likely to be in that group, having to leave school in December this year, having to find a job and finding it very difficult because, as we know and as the people in Australia are becoming more aware, there are going to be more and more <span class="highlight">children</span> unable to find jobs when they leave school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parents will have to keep their <span class="highlight">children</span> for that 3 months until the <span class="highlight">children</span> can go on to the unemployment benefit, and bear in mind there is no increase in the unemployment benefit for <span class="highlight">children</span> under 18 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people in this situation who need social security assistance from the Government are the <span class="highlight">children</span> who are most likely to be leaving school at the earliest opportunity and be looking for a job, but for those under 1 8 years of age there is to be no increase in the benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet those <span class="highlight">children</span> will not get an increase in the benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is easy for honourable senators on the Government side to say that parents have a duty to support their <span class="highlight">children</span>, but duty does not pay the bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I can say is that I think there are going to be a few more turning up looking as though they do not want to get a job because if as honourable senators opposite say that to get a job they have to have decent shoes, decent clothes and clothes that fit, the parents of these <span class="highlight">children</span> are not going to be able to afford those things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that <span class="highlight">children</span> who leave school to go into the work force are human beings and they should be treated in the same way as other people are treated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The duty of parents to their <span class="highlight">children</span> is one thing, but as I have said, duty does not pay the bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should know how much it costs to keep <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators opposite think those people should be assisted in some way to keep up with the rest of the community they should take that feeling through and look after the <span class="highlight">children</span> under 18 years of age whether they are at school or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We told the <span class="highlight">children</span> who will go out to find jobs in December this year that if they were good, if they stayed at school and if they worked hard the world was their oyster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not going to work to provide the wall-to-wall carpets, the second car or the second refrigerator- I am not saying that those things are not needed- and they are not going to work to provide for their <span class="highlight">children</span>’s education because, as I say, most of them will never have <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the Government knows that women for all sorts of reasons find they have to leave home in the middle of the night, with or without their <span class="highlight">children</span>, with or without their goods, and have to find somewhere to go, someone to talk to and some time to assess the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This shows that they do not give a damn about women who hold positions and need care for their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, we were the first government to introduce child endowment and to help the poor families with <span class="highlight">children</span> and again we are the first government to introduce major reforms aimed primarily to benefit the lower income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course increases will also be made in the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance which  Senator Grimes  grudgingly agrees is rather a good part of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This replacement of the tax allowance for <span class="highlight">children</span> with increases in child endowment was a high priority suggested by Professor Henderson in his report following the inquiry into poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another amendment to the Social Services Act concerns that part of the Act which in the past has excluded certain <span class="highlight">children</span> with their alien fathers from eligibility for this child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last 5 years there have been large increases in assistance to poor people who were eligible for benefits and pensions but the allowances for the <span class="highlight">children</span> belonging to those people have been increased by only half as much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Melzer  said, these people still have to buy shoes, clothe, feed and shelter their <span class="highlight">children</span>, and I agree with her, but her government increased this allowance by only half the amount by which it increased other pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition seems to be in favour of only the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>School was resumed on Monday, 13 September but no child was asked to present either a pass or a ticket before Friday, 1 7 September, and drivers were specifically instructed to be lenient, particularly towards small <span class="highlight">children</span>, in the period beyond that date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am told that <span class="highlight">children</span> are now adapting very quickly to the system and there is little, if any, confusion remaining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister believe that the estimates relating to secondary school age <span class="highlight">children</span> in Darwin between 1 977 and 1 980 now indicate an urgent need for the immediate commencement of construction of a fourth high school? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister indicate what plans the Government has to accommodate satisfactorily all secondary school age <span class="highlight">children</span> in Darwin in the years 1978, 1979 and 1980; that is, until the completion of the fourth high school? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make my remarks with particular reference to the way in which the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme relates to students who also are entitled to receive assistance under the Soldiers’ <span class="highlight">Children</span> Education Scheme, which applies to the <span class="highlight">children</span> of servicemen who have died, <span class="highlight">children</span> whose mothers are war widows, or unfortunate <span class="highlight">children</span> who are orphans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier this year the young girl was advised by the Repatriation Department, as it then was, that because she might be eligible to receive under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme assistance supplementary to that available to her under the Soldiers’ <span class="highlight">Children</span> Education Scheme, she should lodge an application with the Department of Education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She was further told by the Repatriation Department that her university admission fees would not be paid through the Soldiers’ <span class="highlight">Children</span> Education Scheme unless she presented a formal advice from the people administering the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme that she was ineligible for benefits under that scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there we have a situation in which there are 2 schemes operatingthe Soldiers’ <span class="highlight">Children</span> Education Scheme and the Tertiary Education Assistance Schemeand in which the Soldiers’ <span class="highlight">Children</span> Education Scheme cannot or will not pay benefits until a person makes application for assistance under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme; and when that matter is decided those people administering the Soldiers’ <span class="highlight">Children</span> Education Scheme can determine the amount that they might be able to pay to a person under the latter scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I emphasise those words- under the Soldiers’ <span class="highlight">Children</span> Education Scheme, including an education allowance of $1,000 per annum, so that the necessary adjustment may be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So the Department of Education had been made fully aware ofthe fact that she was receiving full benefits under the Soldiers’ <span class="highlight">Children</span> Education Scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bear in mind that she had notified the Department of Education that she was in receipt of full benefits from the Department of Repatriation under the Soldiers <span class="highlight">Children</span> Education Scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, this figure did not take into account the Book and Equipment allowance which you will be reimbursed as a beneficiary under the Soldiers <span class="highlight">Children</span> Education Scheme (SCES). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw these matters to the attention of the Senate to show the cavalier way in which the Department of Education is handling its administration of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, particularly as it relates to students who might be eligible for assistance under that scheme as well as under the Soldiers <span class="highlight">Children</span> Education Scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time there is a stranglehold on the creative production process in Australia, very extensive arrangements for the cheap importation of commercial television programs from the United States and a situation in which there is not one body in Australia, including the Government, which seems to be seriously concerned with the sort of cultural development we get when, as I said, <span class="highlight">children</span> of primary school age are watching television for more hours than they are attending school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ultimately the question of whether Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> will be brought up with a secondhand culture and secondhand experiences obtained from television or whether they are to be involved in more creative experiences of a first-hand kind will of course depend on Australians; it will not depend on the importation of pap from the United States- or it might do, tragically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Up to 70 per cent of <span class="highlight">children</span> in some juvenile institutions, or homes, as they are euphemistically called, are Aboriginal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that when history is written and when some of our <span class="highlight">children</span> or grandchildren read it they will look with dismay at the actions of the then LiberalCountry Party coalition and the methods it used to get back into government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Yugoslav Government’s national health scheme coven this man and his <span class="highlight">children</span>, but that Government has rightly raised the question about his wife. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is covering the invalid pensioner and his <span class="highlight">children</span> under its national health scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That conclusion is in conformity with what I regard as an important principle, namely that extradition proceedings should not be used as an indirect means of obtaining or attempting to obtain custody of or access to <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The restoration of <span class="highlight">children</span> is, I think, more properly a matter for civil proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Can the Minister representing the Minister for Telecommunications give an assurance that if any alteration to the broadcasting control system is to be considered by him following the Green report, protection of <span class="highlight">children</span> through the design of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs, viewing times and quality will be given top priority? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have received literature from voluntary organisations drawing attention to the need for appropriate programs to be presented in <span class="highlight">children</span>’s viewing hours and equally, if possible, that proper protection be afforded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am unaware of the contemplation of the method of ensuring standards for the future but in any case there is an overwhelming need for both the national and the commercial elements of broadcasting and television to assume a voluntary responsibility to ensure that the quality of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television viewing is the highest possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Will the Minister for Social Security inform the Senate whether she made a promise on a television program  Telethon  in Perth on the weekend of 16 and 17 October that the Fraser Government would give the  Sir David  Brand Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Centre a $1 for $4 subsidy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am able to advise the Senate is that with regard to the Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span> (Assistance) Act projects in Western Australia it was said on the television program and elsewhere during that day that a meeting would be arranged between the Federal Government, the State Government and voluntary agencies dealing with assistance to handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> to determine the priorities of the projects which could be approved in the 3-year program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Can the Minister explain how the Federal Government will ensure the diversification of the use made of existing pre-schools and what kinds of new activities the Government would accept as giving support to <span class="highlight">children</span> in need? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to what funding procedures the Federal Government will adopt in giving special attention to Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> and migrant <span class="highlight">children</span>, we have funds available now for new projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wherever possible funds will be given for specific areas which would be of assistance to Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> and migrant <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Early meetings have been arranged between the Federal Government and State governments to discuss the future funding for pre-school education after 30 June next year and to determine other ways in which the <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services program of the Federal Government may be implemented at State government, local government and community levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This very sad story relates to a young Aboriginal girl with 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>, one aged 2 years and the other a 7-month old baby who had a very bad heart condition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She had been looking after the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She cared about nothing but her <span class="highlight">children</span> and the fact that she had a very ill baby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply draw to the attention of the  Senator that  the Senate Select Committee on Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders was concerned with this problem and with the undue contribution it makes to the death of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia who, operating as these <span class="highlight">children</span> often do on the basis of marginal nutrition, are particularly susceptible to gastro enteritis which plays a disproportionate role in the excess mortality we see among Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidence was also given to the Committee that in the Northern Territory, for example, many admissions of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> to hospital are on the basis of gastro enteritis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I make is that the <span class="highlight">children</span> die of dehydration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Swaziland they have set up a network of 14 tiny clinics, each staffed by a nurse and covering an area within a radius of 20 or 30 miles, and at the clinics fluids can be given by the nurses into the peritoneal cavity and that will save the life of these <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anything we can do to stop these <span class="highlight">children</span> dying of dehydration would be a worthwhile initiative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guarantee continuing parent and teacher representation on the Australian Schools Commission through the two recognised national bodies, namely the Australian Council of State School Organisations and the Australian Teachers Federation who represent the vast majority of <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia attending Government Schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for Social Security a question concerning the proposed arrangements for holiday care programs for school <span class="highlight">children</span> to be assisted by the Office of Child Care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hoped that these projects will be of assistance to <span class="highlight">children</span> in the Australian Capital Territory, in particular those <span class="highlight">children</span> of working parents, single parents and others who require this special service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Is the Minister for Education aware of the generally held view that <span class="highlight">children</span> with mental deficiency should be treated in special school situations with less ambitious goals, later starting ages and less sensory input than normal <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can he detail some of the quite incredible educational goals being achieved by certain <span class="highlight">children</span> with Down’s syndrome at a special school in Sydney? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am happy to say that there is a growing belief that those with handicaps should be kept as far as possible amongst the <span class="highlight">children</span> of their age groups in ordinary schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There, as one example, the staff have taken young <span class="highlight">children</span> of, I think, 4 or 5 years of age who have Down’s syndrome- that is, they are mongoloid, having a genetic aberration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where normally one would believe that those <span class="highlight">children</span> could not be trained in the routine basic skills of literacy and numeracy, it has become quite clear that with the application of special training they are making remarkable progress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the meetings that took place with the Acting Prime Minister at the time, Jim Cairns, and with  Mr Snedden,  it was agreed that the pressure on Darwin should be relieved by evacuation of the women and <span class="highlight">children</span>, the infirm and the ill. To Major-General Stretton ‘s credit, he entered into that exercise with great enthusiasm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>But the guidelines were set down that only women, <span class="highlight">children</span> and the infirm were to be evacuated and that Darwin was not to be stripped of its work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A meeting has been planned for next week with all States with regard to future programs and to work towards a 3-year program for <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arising from these changes and other matters which will be discussed with the States next week, I am sure that we will be able to develop a <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services program with consultation that will be to the advantage of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As <span class="highlight">children</span> of their industrial labour parent, they have that responsibility to show some leadership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Principal among these are programs for disadvantaged country areas, to which I have just alluded, emergency aid for nongovernment schools in temporary financial difficulties, particularly in country areas, and grants for the education of <span class="highlight">children</span> living in institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will be continuing the special purpose programs in 1977, generally at about the same level of activity as in 1976- for migrant and multi-cultural education; for disadvantaged schools; for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>; for educational services and development; and for special projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That we, the undersigned, declare that we are concerned at the increasingly alarming child care situation, where only one place is available for every 10 pre-school <span class="highlight">children</span> and where, in New South Wales, only 184 out of the 891 childcare centres in existence offer long day care for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of working mothers, despite the changing socio-economic conditions in Australia and the increased numbers of working mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you make funds available urgently for long day care centres and that all funds allocated for child care be directed only to those child-care centres willing to provide long day care, preschool and after-school care, holiday care and emergency day care for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you make funds available urgently for long day care centres and that all funds allocated for child care be directed only to those child-care centres willing to provide long day care, preschool and after-school care, holiday care ana emergency day care for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is the Minister aware of widespread concern amongst a large number of parents in the community that such replacement will diminish the already inadequate surveillance over program standards, particularly insofar as they affect <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister give an unqualified assurance that the Tribunal will not consist of representatives of the broadcasting industry, many of whom are interested only in peddling programs which at best can be described as below standard and at worst destructive so far as <span class="highlight">children</span> are concerned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would enable the public to put before an inquiry its views on what the standards ought to be, on what the measures of good taste ought to be and perhaps on what times ought to be allocated for <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of concern being expressed at the potentiality of many of these toys to injure and maim <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act, the Government provides financial assistance on a $4 for $ 1 basis to approved voluntary religious and similar organisations towards the cost of establishing and maintaining sheltered workshops, activity centres, training centres for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> and residential accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe- I think this Government is recognising this-that the opportunities for Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> must not in any way be hampered by their inability to receive an equal opportunity in education, no matter what vocation they have in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had also given hope to parents, particularly parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> in the poorer schools, in both government and nongovernment sectors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The program instituted by the Labor Government meant that these <span class="highlight">children</span> would have an equal opportunity with <span class="highlight">children</span> of parents who were better able to afford an education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our program ensured that all Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> would be able to get a standard of education which I am sure all of us would wish to see. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am thinking of the Committee’s inquiry into the education of isolated school <span class="highlight">children</span>, the report of which was presented to the Senate only a few weeks ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem of isolated school <span class="highlight">children</span> and the problem of isolation from school facilities have become prominent for a number of reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decline in rural incomes means that the number of people who might be able to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to independent schools or to metropolitan areas to attend schools is fewer than it used to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the report of the Senate Committee pointed out, isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> do not have equal educational opportunity with those <span class="highlight">children</span> who are not isolated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Emphasis has been placed on the funding of facilities for isolated school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the Government has responded to this plea, and there has been an appreciative response from the federal organisation of the Isolated <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Parents Association in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One statistic which came to my notice recently related to the time spent by <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia watching television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that among the various matters which might be looked at by the Williams committee under its very wide terms of reference could be the impact of television on <span class="highlight">children</span>, particularly <span class="highlight">children</span> of primary school age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, they are paying extra tax to provide for Medibank; there is no deduction for <span class="highlight">children</span> on their tax returns now and so they have to pay more tax; they are spending extra money out of their income because of the pressure to buy private health insurance that they will not ever need, and many of them are out of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, many people in Victoria feel that the money has fallen into a big black hole because they cannot see what good it has done for their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were the schools to which <span class="highlight">children</span> went when they were at the end of the row. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were the <span class="highlight">children</span> who came from disadvantaged homes; they had language difficulties; and they had a dislike of learning because of the way they had gone through the education system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that area there is justification for more money being put into capital grants because up to this point in time so many <span class="highlight">children</span> have come from disadvantaged areas with very little beauty in their lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that in some of the schools that I have gone into in that area the inspiration and belief of those teachers in those <span class="highlight">children</span> and what they could contribute is one of the most beautiful things I have encountered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Up to this point in time the Victorian Government has given no indication that it envisages anything like that for the <span class="highlight">children</span> in those areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one judges by the debates on education that take place in this Parliament it would seem that all one needs to be capable of making decisions on policy in relation to education is firstly to have been to school oneself; secondly, preferably to have had <span class="highlight">children</span> who have gone to school; and thirdly- this is purely an option- to have witnessed at some stage or another students in an educational institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one travels around the fringe camps of Alice Springs one sees parents and <span class="highlight">children</span> living in a state of absolute squalor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reasons the other <span class="highlight">children</span> were not attending school varied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why that single child was attending school was that both its parents had a certain minimal level of education, and they were of the few, as far as I could gather, of their race who still believed that education for their <span class="highlight">children</span> meant something for the future of the childrenthe opportunity of a decent life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other <span class="highlight">children</span> were not at school for a variety of reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Primarily, their parents were not motivated to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On what basis does one motivate people if one cannot say at the end: ‘Here is something which is of benefit to you or your <span class="highlight">children</span>”? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further how can one expect parents to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to school when, frankly, the parents have barely allowed the <span class="highlight">children</span> to sleep all night? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we see <span class="highlight">children</span> asleep over their desks at school and we know that one of the reasons why those <span class="highlight">children</span> are asleep is that they have been unable to sleep the previous night in their camp as a direct result of the avail.ability of alcohol, we must ask ourselves: What on earth are we doing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one enters these fringe camps one sees the ground littered with broken glass and rusty tin cans, and one is aware of the non-existence in many cases of hygienic conditions to the point that one can marvel at the fact that more than half of the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> live to school age without succumbing to either tetanus or hepatitis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One nevertheless sees that the camp is full of school age <span class="highlight">children</span>, not at school, running around, in no way attracted to school and in no way motivated themselves or through their parents to attend school which is easily accessible, to which they could be transported by a free bus which calls regularly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some colleges take Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> from their families and train them to a certain level of ability in literacy and numeracy and they train some of those <span class="highlight">children</span> to achieve a certain ability in subjects such as manual crafts, hygiene, child care and nutrition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I move to the education of the isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was certainly a member of the Committee long enough to see the problems faced by isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> and their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the area of education and what was offered to the <span class="highlight">children</span>, particularly the older students who were looking perhaps at secondary education up to matriculation level the basic problems for parents were finance and the picking up of their <span class="highlight">children</span> and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government review its educational policy in the Northern Territory to ensure equal education opportunity for both Aboriginal and European <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the people living in remote areas felt that the amount of money that was being spent on Aboriginals was in excess of what was being spent on the European <span class="highlight">children</span>, and there was some reaction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The payment of benefits under the Assistance for Isolated <span class="highlight">Children</span> Scheme to be continued and that levels of assistance and application of the means test for additional allowances be reviewed annually so that allowances are paid at a rate commensurate with education expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have personally sent him a number of letters and a number of telegrams which I have received from parents who have complained about the small amount of assistance which is available to the parents of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should be allowed to remain in the class with the rest of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of his own age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first step is that the teachers who are working with these <span class="highlight">children</span> would need to have teacher aides to assist them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More equipment will be needed to meet the special needs of this child and there will need to be adequate teacher training to prepare the teachers to move in and work with these <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the Northern Territory chapter of the Australian College of Education has been moved to mount a survey to find out whether teachers have been adequately prepared, how they themselves see their training, how the <span class="highlight">children</span> see the training and how the administrators or supervisors see the training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is need for a lot more assistance than is being given at the present time both for <span class="highlight">children</span> and for adults. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Minister would be prepared to discuss with his colleagues the possibility of establishing a migrant centre for Darwin which could not only service the <span class="highlight">children</span> and adults of the Darwin area but also act as a centre for the rest of the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that at the time of the most disturbing situation in Timor quite a number of Timorese people came to Darwin-Chinese Timorese and indigenous Timorese- and we were able to set up very quickly and very effectively a school to meet the needs of those <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask him to look at the needs of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>, to take account of what  Senator Davidson  has said and to take account of the financial hardships suffered by the parents, to which I have just briefly alluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts for its report on the problems of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was happy to attend the federal meeting of the Isolated <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Parents Association at Broken Hill at which  Senator Davidson,  the  Chairman  of that Committee, gave the occasional address and referred to aspects of the Committee’s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would provide an efficient service to the school <span class="highlight">children</span> patients in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is better to make a few mistakes in areas like that than to neglect the whole system and deny our <span class="highlight">children</span> a proper education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One matter mentioned was isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this respect, I was happy to receive many letters from isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> ‘s associations throughout Australia commending us upon what we had done and saying that in our allowances provided to them we had gone beyond their hopes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other consideration that I think has to be given in relation to these amendments is to those completely dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>- I talk of them as <span class="highlight">children</span> only in the sense that they are born to a particular marriage- whom we find frequently in our society, such as a man or a woman, sometimes in middle age, who has devoted his or her entire life to looking after aged and infirm parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, as my colleague the shadow Minister for Primary Industry said, it is a crying shame that in a nation where women and <span class="highlight">children</span> in the industrial areas in the cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth cannot afford to buy fruit the only solution that can be found to try to improve the lot of the canned fruit industry is the scheme brought in by the McMahon Government to pull trees out so that fruit would be dearer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Gietzelt pointed out, it is a shame that we have to make money available to producers to wreck an industry, to curtail production, when there are so many women and <span class="highlight">children</span> and elderly people in this community who could well do with that fruit if the Government could see its way clear to help that fruit to be placed on the market at a cheaper price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) and (2) State and community organisations operating pre-schools have, for the most part, accepted the objectives of maximising the use of pre-school facilities, of extending the services offered and of operating in a way that links preschool services with other services directed to the care and development of <span class="highlight">children</span> and the support of families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-70-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Other reasons for the failure of businesses include drastic and unnotified increases in rates of all kinds; very drastic increases in interest rates from 4% per cent to  9V4  per cent applying to people buying houses from the Government; the Medibank levy, which, of course, is nothing but a huge increase in personal taxation and is recognised now to be so by the electorate; the very rapid increase in bus fares and the introduction of school bus fares to school <span class="highlight">children</span> in the Australian Capital Territory which, again, has taken a toll on the real disposable income of families with several <span class="highlight">children</span> in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A very delightful telegram came from 2 little Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>, a little boy and a little girl. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Even <span class="highlight">children</span> were listening in to the broadcast of our proceedings yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition there is recognition of the considerable interest which is being taken in the improvement of programs for <span class="highlight">children</span> as well as those of more specific interest to women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, I think we have to watch with great care, in any changes that occur, what happens in relation to <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are concerned with the situation of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The television industry has demonstrated for 20 years its total inability to cater for <span class="highlight">children</span>’s needs in their prime viewing time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span>’s television can no longer be left to change and the commercial hunt for ratings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has not been for many years a situation in relation to which we can be satisfied with what the <span class="highlight">children</span> in this community have had inflicted on them, because of the profit motive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to know now what concern this Government feels for <span class="highlight">children</span> and for <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not seen any evidence of concern either by this Government or by private industry in this area for <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously women must be concerned about <span class="highlight">children</span>, so we have a prerequisite for 2 women, God help this Government if 10 women turn up who are eligible for appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that not all women feel all that much concern for <span class="highlight">children</span>, and even fathers have some concern for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It set out 8 principles on which it thought <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television in this country should be based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The producer must have demonstrable interest in <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span> should be encouraged to take active pan in sports and hobbies through television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be no stereo heroes and non-heroes in <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those were the 8 areas in which the advisory committee advised the Control Board that something should be done about <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Melbourne  Age  green paper for Friday, 10 December, in the time between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m.- the time when <span class="highlight">children</span> could reasonably be expected to watch television- these were the sorts of programs that television in Victoria had listed, and I say ‘had listed ‘ because we have not got to 10 December yet: GTV9 had  6Vi  hours of programs that could be called ‘designated for <span class="highlight">children</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that we have kindergarten programs, so called family comedies, educational programs put forward by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and some other little programs designated as ‘education for <span class="highlight">children</span>’ programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On GTV9 there appears 6 hours of programs that could be called designated for <span class="highlight">children</span>, 5 te hours of those programs coming from America and one hour coming from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On HSV7 half an hour is listed in that time for <span class="highlight">children</span> and that is an American cartoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remainder of the time that could reasonably be called hours for <span class="highlight">children</span>’s viewing is taken up by tennis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On ABV2 in relation to programs for <span class="highlight">children</span> there is one hour and twenty five minutes from the United States, half an hour from Britain and half an hour from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From them all we have cartoons for an hour at a time; we have family comedies- I am not sure whether honourable senators opposite watch television but  McHale’s Navy  and  Gilligan’s Island,  both of which must be 4200 years old, are the sorts of programs that go into that family viewing time- we have half an hour of documentary, with a question mark, and a half hour deemed <span class="highlight">children</span>’s educational programs’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people such as those on the Australian <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Television Action Committee are worried about the current situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many more people should be worried about the current <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television situation because these are the sorts of programs which our <span class="highlight">children</span> are watching hour after hour, day after day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People such as those on the Australian <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Television Action Committee are worried because the Federation of Commercial Television Stations has never stuck to the standards which either the commercial stations laid down when they applied for their licence or which the Government since has attempted to lay down for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When these stations applied for their licences they were very pious about what they were going to do for the people of Australia in regard to television, what they were going to do for the performers, musicians, actors and writers, and even occasionally for the <span class="highlight">children</span> and women of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we get to what they promised <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia it is a slightly different picture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ATN Sydney for its first year did not mention <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously <span class="highlight">children</span> would be in bed, out of sight and out of mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TCN Sydney for its first year did not mention nor did it promise anything for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in its third year there were 30 minutes of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs and, because we are all concerned with education just as we are concerned with motherhood, 30 minutes of educational programs in its first and second years and one hour in its third year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>HSV7 promised 3 hours of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs in its first year and 4 hours of educational programs but has never got to that point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a picture on the television screen and <span class="highlight">children</span> watch television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So do <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To <span class="highlight">children</span> it is a most compulsive medium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TV has taught our <span class="highlight">children</span> to kill before they have learnt to read. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should all be concerned that we do not know what effect television has on our <span class="highlight">children</span>, because they are all our <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These showed that of the films that were shown during the hours <span class="highlight">children</span> watched television, there were 57 hours of American films. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of Australian films that were shown in the hours that <span class="highlight">children</span> could watch television there were 29 hours- one hundred per cent from the ABCand they included films that are called educational; that is, put on by the education departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the amount of films <span class="highlight">children</span> watch in America, and I submit in Australia too because I do not think our <span class="highlight">children</span> watch any less television than do American <span class="highlight">children</span>, nor on the figures I have been given do they watch any less American television than do American <span class="highlight">children</span>, a child is involved with violence 25 times a day, even though the American figures show that the chance of a person being involved with violence is only 14 000 to 1. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome greatly the report this week that the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts is going to concern itself with the part played by television in <span class="highlight">children</span>’s lives and education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1 46 articles in behavioural science journals representing SO studies of 10 000 <span class="highlight">children</span>, all showed that violent viewing has produced increased aggressive behaviour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a parent who lets her <span class="highlight">children</span> watch television, who knows her <span class="highlight">children</span> enjoy television, who knows her <span class="highlight">children</span> and she herself learn from television, I am concerned that this great power for learning should be treated in a proper way so that our <span class="highlight">children</span> are not at a disadvantage in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those figures are not necessarily bad but they are bad if the television our <span class="highlight">children</span> see is setting them on the wrong path and is giving them the wrong incentives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a great medium from which to learn, and I think we underestimate the intelligence and interest of our <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have watched my <span class="highlight">children</span> and I know that although the television screen mesmerises them, the programs they really enjoy are the programs that tease their imaginations, their powers to learn, their powers to investigate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no indication that they care two hoots about our <span class="highlight">children</span> or about the power that television has over those <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, commercial stations are not supposed to show trailers of adult films in <span class="highlight">children</span> s viewing times, but they do it over and over again because I have seen them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The material they have put out has shown that they are concerned about the profits that might be made from advertisements on ABV2 but there has been no material from any of the commercial stations or commercial organisations which shows that they are concerned in any way at all about <span class="highlight">children</span> or <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span> are very persuasive of their parents in buying goods, and when one watches the programs between 3.30 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. and sees the advertisements that go on and the persuasion directed to a 12-year-old, who keeps insisting that her life will be blighted if she does not have a particular form of breakfast food, then one knows why the commercial stations are more concerned with advertisements shown during the times <span class="highlight">children</span> watch than with the sort of material they put on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is some glorious mind-expanding material which could go on for <span class="highlight">children</span> in what is really a very great medium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an area that affects our <span class="highlight">children</span> and it affects our future, and it should have the fullest public debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Melzer  referred to programs that are being shown on television in hours when <span class="highlight">children</span> can view them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of them are certainly not what I would suggest is appropriate for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is pretty grim for young <span class="highlight">children</span> to view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Melzer  said, how they have fallen down on their responsibilities to provide anything in the way of programs for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must emphasise, on behalf of the people of Tasmania, how much the orchestra has meant not only to the adult public in that State but also to the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were two <span class="highlight">children</span> ofthe marriage and  Mr Reardon  was awarded custody of the child Elizabeth Ann, with reasonable access to her mother, and  Mrs Ritzell  was awarded custody of the child Andrew David, with reasonable access to his father. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-89-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a general principle, one that has been accepted by Attorneys-General in successive Governments, that extradition should not be used as an indirect means of obtaining, or attempting to obtain, custody of, or access to, <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-89-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I endorse that principle and express the view that the determination of rights to <span class="highlight">children</span> in circumstances Uke the present is properly a matter for civil proceedings by the parties concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-89-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That residents of the suburb of Fraser, in the Australian Capital Territory are deeply concerned at the lack of adequate educational facilities to be made available to our primary school aged <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That plans to remove <span class="highlight">children</span> daily to other suburbs will cause overcrowding, will force parents to private transport or pay bus levies, and will make a mockery of the frequently quoted A.C.T. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners therefore most humbly pray that Senate in Parliament assembled will take urgent steps to revise current plans for the education of our <span class="highlight">children</span> with a view to the provision of a government primary school in Fraser. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Opposition also came from academics and scholars, teachers, parents concerned with standards of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s broadcasting, ethnic groups which, in the period of the Whitlam Government for the first time had had access to broadcasting, and in particular, members of the staff of the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have noticed that young <span class="highlight">children</span> and teenagers particularly are absolutely fascinated by programs like  Rush  and  Power Without Glory,  which give them some insight into their own history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also the question of standards but I will not dwell on that subject because my colleague  Senator Melzer  spoke very persuasively last night about the needs for standards for <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television and there is to be a Senate Standing Committee inquiry into that matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A lot of concern was expressed, and rightly so, about the quality of television and broadcasting as it relates to <span class="highlight">children</span> primarily, during <span class="highlight">children</span>’s viewing and listening times, and to adults, because assault on the eyes and ears is as bad in many ways as physical assault on the body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The other 2 members of the Broadcasting Control Board who would be affected are:  Dr Patricia  Edgar of La Trobe University, who has published a number of reports relating to <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television standards in this country, and  Mr E.  A. Kellam who was appointed this year by the Liberal Government and who was formerly managing director of Dunlop Australia Ltd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She made the point very clearly that in America television has taught <span class="highlight">children</span> to kill before they learn to read. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have problems with <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs, on which we hear contradictory arguments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have suggested also representation from the Australian Schools Commission because there has been a lot of pious cant about <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television emanating from people like me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important thing is that we recognise that a body such as the Schools Commission should be represented on the Broadcasting Council because <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television and the sort of educational standards which one would hope that the broadcasting system will inject a little more of into the Australian community would be very important considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) In Norfolk Isalnd, Island, of the three inhabited Island Territories whose administration falls within my portfolio, education is compulsory for <span class="highlight">children</span> between the ages of six and fifteen years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-64-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While education is not compulsory in either Christmas or the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the majority of <span class="highlight">children</span> do in fact attend school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-64-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Certainly in recent years there have been no cases of non-attendance by school-age <span class="highlight">children</span> on either Christmas Island or West Island, Cocos. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-64-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is the Minister aware of widespread concern amongst a large number of parents in the community that such replacement will diminish the already inadequate surveillance over program standards, particularly insofar as they affect <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister give an unqualified assurance that the Tribunal will not consist of representatives of the broadcasting industry, many of whom are interested only in peddling programs which at best can be described as below standard and at worst destructive so far as <span class="highlight">children</span> are concerned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undoubtedly, considerable attention will be focused on matters such as the extent and quality of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programming, as well as the Australian content of station program formats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under these circumstances I see little possibility of any reduction of effort by the new regulatory authority to ensure that there are adequate measures to safeguard the interests of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-9">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, can the Minister comment on the following claims that were made in the article: Firstly, that no Australian education authorities are notified of the arrival or existence of school aged migrant <span class="highlight">children</span>, and secondly, that there is at present no procedure for finding out the number of non-English speaking migrant <span class="highlight">children</span>, particularly teen-agers, who are not going to school? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister undertake to investigate these claims and if necessary take steps to rectify the situation so that the older migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> are given the educational opportunities to which they are entitled? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very well aware that the reference which the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts undertook in relation to isolated school <span class="highlight">children</span> afforded the opportunity to representatives of the isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>’s community to present to the Parliament, and thereby through the Parliament to the Government, a whole range of opinions and a whole range of circumstances and situations in which this section of the Australian community is involved and about which it is concerned so that the Committee could bring down a report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 18 August last year the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts presented to the Senate its report on isolated school <span class="highlight">children</span> and there was put before the Senate a motion that the Senate take note of the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 13 September 1972 the Senate resolved that this reference on isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I asked for leave to continue my remarks I was pointing out to the Senate that the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts had received a reference relating to the education of isolated school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report indicates that the reference related to <span class="highlight">children</span> who, for geographic reasons, have no reasonable daily access to an appropriate school or who cannot be afforded equal education opportunities with other <span class="highlight">children</span>, or who cannot be provided with an education suitable to their talents and interests to equip them for employment in the occupational field they select. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another part of the reference invited the Committee to investigate the means by which these disabilities can be overcome, by extension and deployment more widely of schools or institutes of tertiary education and the provision of financial aid to isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that the introduction of the then Commonwealth Government’s assistance scheme for isolated school <span class="highlight">children</span> largely resolved the problem which was referred to in our reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the assistance for isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> scheme which was introduced in 1973 by the government of the day, an isolated child was defined as one who, because of the geographic isolation of his home, did not have reasonable daily access to a government school providing courses of the appropriate level, that is either primary or secondary level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall take a little time to emphasise this point because when a committee of the Senate is dealing with a matter relating to isolated school <span class="highlight">children</span> it has to be extremely careful in relation to the definition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that the moment we start to talk about definitions we have presented to us a whole range of circumstances about which there can be some considerable debate as to what is the correct definition of a group known as isolated school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, after some determination, the Committee took account of a number of categories of <span class="highlight">children</span> in trying to reach what I hope is understood to be a sympathetic and compassionate definition of isolated school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, there were those <span class="highlight">children</span> who did not have daily access to school facilities because of the remoteness of their homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were those <span class="highlight">children</span> who lived in sparsely populated areas and who could be conveyed to school daily but whose numbers were insufficient to warrant the provision of any educational transportation system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, there were those <span class="highlight">children</span> living in areas where there was no secondary school and whose homes were beyond the transportation range of the nearest secondary school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We felt that we should never overlook those <span class="highlight">children</span> attending a small school where one teacher supervised a number of <span class="highlight">children</span> in different grades. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, it was taken into account that there were <span class="highlight">children</span> attending a country high school which did not offer a sufficient number of courses in the senior secondary school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, there was the very important matter of <span class="highlight">children</span> who had to travel excessive distances over unsealed or unformed roads, which imposed personal hardship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking the matter a bit further, the Committee took into account those <span class="highlight">children</span> of itinerant or seasonal workers whose frequent change of residence or domicile rendered it impractical for them to attend school regularly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was making the point that the Committee which was dealing with the matter of education for isolated school <span class="highlight">children</span> had to look very early at defining the meaning of an isolated school child or a group of people known as isolated school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I move now to that very important and needy group of <span class="highlight">children</span> who require remedial instruction and who do not have access to special educational facilities in the region in which they happen to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must never overlook those <span class="highlight">children</span> who suffer from short-term or long-term illness, or physical disabilities, or mental disabilities and who are isolated from the appropriate education facilities which might render them some assistance or opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an investigation, if we talk about isolated school <span class="highlight">children</span> it necessarily and naturally follows that the matter of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> comes into consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee in its investigations discovered and recognised that <span class="highlight">children</span> of Aboriginal descent accounted for a large proportion of Australia’s isolated school population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee decided that because of the unique problems associated with this group of <span class="highlight">children</span> it would be preferable to conduct a separate inquiry into Aboriginal education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We contacted education authorities in other countries because we felt that some countries appeared to have similar problems in providing education for <span class="highlight">children</span> in geographically isolated areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to report to the Senate tonight that information received from these countries indicated that those which had comparable vast and sparsely populated areas approached the problem in a rather different way by providing complex transportation systems and government financial assistance which subsidised <span class="highlight">children</span>’s boarding expenses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should also point out to the Senate that the introduction of the Commonwealth Government’s 1973 scheme of assistance for isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> had an influence on the course of the inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme was introduced specifically to assist parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> who did not have reasonable access to government school facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter was suspended in part but in 1975 the Committee decided to continue the inquiry in order to make an assessment of the adequacy and effect of the financial assistance being provided under the Commonwealth Government’s scheme as a means of alleviating the educational disadvantage of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While dealing with the problems of isolated families and isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>, I thought it was pertinent to point out to the Senate that there were matters relating to the major purpose of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This takes on a particular importance when we are dealing with isolated school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once upon a time this demand was required of only a few, and I think it is true to say that the balance of all educational spending should be slanted towards those years when <span class="highlight">children</span> are at school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it could be described as an intervention which is designed to widen the options, increase the possibilities and experiences open to all <span class="highlight">children</span>, particularly to those whose options are limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the education of isolated school <span class="highlight">children</span> is not only an educational matter but also a national matter and a social matter of the greatest possible importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am referring to that very splendid nationally oriented community known as the Isolated <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Parents Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take a moment to look at the general recommendations contained in the Senate Standing Committee’s report relating to isolated school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moving on, we dealt with boarding facilities for isolated school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will very well appreciate that when one is dealing with any isolated community, especially as far as <span class="highlight">children</span> are concerned, very sympathetic and practical attention must be given to boarding accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, <span class="highlight">children</span> from these areas are required to spend a great deal of their time in institutions which are away from thenown personal homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the matter of special education, one was very much aware of the number of <span class="highlight">children</span> in isolated areas who suffer from some disability and who do not have access to special facilities such as those available to <span class="highlight">children</span> in urban areas, and recommendations have been made along those lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In October 1976, on the basis of the Committee’s recommendations, new education allowances for isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> were provided and these became effective from 1 January this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has also been a development of the concept of what is called unlimited schools for isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, while greatly improving educational services to isolated school <span class="highlight">children</span>, such schools will also perform a wider function and open up a variety of possibilities throughout any given State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I am prepared to claim in the Senate tonight that the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts has by its work on the inquiry into this reference relating to isolated school <span class="highlight">children</span> opened up a range of public interest in education for isolated school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have received and read in detail with great interest the report on isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only when one is compelled to travel distances to the various remote areas of Australia that one can come to understand what are the grave disadvantages to the families in these areas, not only to the <span class="highlight">children</span> but also to the parents because the parents of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> have 2 major roles, one as educators or local teacher and the other in incurring considerable expense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people who had hoped that they would have sufficient funds to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to schools in southern areas have been forced to curtail their activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is hopeful that one of the methods of improving education of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>, particularly in the Territories, could be the upgrading of high schools in places such as Darwin and Katherine to full matriculation level thus providing wider opportunities so that there would be no need to send student <span class="highlight">children</span> to places further away thus incurring considerable expense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The distances being less, the school <span class="highlight">children</span> would be able to return to their homes more frequently than they would otherwise be able to do during the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are busy developing a wider facility for the parents and <span class="highlight">children</span> concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government was able to introduce for isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> along with a range of allowances affecting some 10 different categories of student <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has recognised the very severe educational disadvantage suffered by <span class="highlight">children</span> in remote country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst it recognises the need to provide adequate financial assistance for parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> who have to leave home to attend school, it takes the view that in the long term the solution to many of the problems facing isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> lies in upgrading the educational services provided, including the service to those who have to enrol in correspondence schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This program is designed to provide funds for government and non-government school systems jointly to initiate pilot programs in designated country areas with a view to finding the best ways of improving educational services for country <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The special project innovations grants were made available in 1976 to a number of systems and authorities to initiate other pilot projects and feasibility studies relating to the needs of country <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The majority of the recommendations contained in the report on education of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> referred specifically to action that can be taken only by State education authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that four of the Committee’s recommendations- recommendations 10, 11,21 and 32- deal with allowances payable under the assistance for isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second home allowance for 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>, previously $700, was increased to $925. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For three or more <span class="highlight">children</span> the allowance was increased from $1,050 to $1,275. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is also aware of reports that Fretilin used civilians, including women and <span class="highlight">children</span>, to shield its soldiers in combat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pensions payable to widows and the additional pension payable in respect of eligible <span class="highlight">children</span> will be adjusted on the same basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Appropriate adjustments will also be made to the additional component of pensions payable to <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The compensation that would have been payable would have been, firstly, a lump sum payment of $25,000 and, secondly, a payment of $10 a week in respect of each of his 2 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question which is directed to the Minister for Education refers to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts in relation to the education of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am well aware of the work of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts on the subject of the education of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am equally aware that the isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>’s parents associations have been drawing attention to these matters and advocating reforms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for the Capital Territory aware of reports that a local radio station 2CC is advertising that a man calling himself the 2CC man will be at the Canberra Show and will give money to <span class="highlight">children</span> who approach him and ask whether he is the 2CC man? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister agree that this kind of advertising is an open invitation to adults with dubious motives to go to the show and pose as the 2CC man in order to attract the attention of <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister investigate these reports immediately and take any steps necessary to protect the safety of young <span class="highlight">children</span> who may be exposed to serious danger as a result of this advertising campaign? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Aboriginal and Islander women living on reserves in Queensland are entitled to receive family allowance payments under the same conditions as all other women with <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-40-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact that lone fathers with young <span class="highlight">children</span> may qualify for this benefit is generally well known to welfare organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-41-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a lawyer occasionally involved in matrimonial contests I have seen <span class="highlight">children</span> wielded by one parent to achieve a course of action by another parent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe these people have used Victorian <span class="highlight">children</span> in a similar manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to look at the figures in relation to school age <span class="highlight">children</span> for the year 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of the 1.3 million <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia between the ages of 4 and 11 years, one out of four has neither parent at home during working hours and at least 16 000 are left at home each day alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A straw sample of parents, which bears no relationship to the number of <span class="highlight">children</span> a family, shows that in a number of working families no arrangements were made for the care of 43 700 <span class="highlight">children</span>; 53 200 <span class="highlight">children</span> were left in the care of friends and relatives while other arrangements were made for 13 500 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  gave figures as at the end of May 1976, 1 think it was, which showed that there were some 200 000 <span class="highlight">children</span> in the 4 to 1 1 years age group with both parents in the labour force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have a new phrase in Australian jargon today- ‘latch key <span class="highlight">children</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They may be defined as <span class="highlight">children</span> whose parents are in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">children</span> come home from school, get the key, open up the house and wait for their parents to come home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is generally accepted that very young <span class="highlight">children</span> have an absolute need for a mother’s care and attention and can suffer severe deprivation if, during those tender years, they are put in the care of persons outside the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Australian  newspaper of the following date reported that she said that more than 600 000 American <span class="highlight">children</span> under 16 years of age were involved in prostitution and pornography. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This should alert the Government to contrast the increasing costs in this area with its financial commitment to those fortunate <span class="highlight">children</span> and parents who have the advantage of a contented and happy family background, which fortunately is still the case in the majority of families in Australia, and who do not cost the Government one cent apart from the universal family allowance payment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I was interested to hear the speech that has just been given by  Senator Tehan  and particularly the earlier pan of his speech in which he discussed the problems that exist for many tens of thousands of Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> as a result of broken homes and other disabilities which are caused through the economic circumstances of families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can they and their <span class="highlight">children</span> look forward to the future with hope because of this Speech, a Speech which we are told is a blueprint for this Government’s future actions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we suggest that stopping all school leavers getting the unemployment benefit in order to catch the few who try to beat the system is immoral and discriminates severely against the <span class="highlight">children</span> of pensioners and other poor people in the community who need this benefit so that they can dress adequately and travel to look for jobs in a society which has very few jobs for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Speech did not mention that at the same time as this reform was introduced it was offset by the removal of the taxation rebates for <span class="highlight">children</span> and more than offset by the introduction of the Medibank levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Figures produced by the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  at the time demonstrated that 75 per cent of wage earners in this country, that is, those on average weekly earnings, those just below average weekly earnings and those just above who have 3 <span class="highlight">children</span> or less- the vast majority of wage earners in this country- had a decrease in disposable income as a result of these moves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, they wanted some assurance that they were, in fact, wanted by the community and that they and their <span class="highlight">children</span> would have a future as farmers in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister agree that such a requirement contravenes section 13 (4) (a) of the Schools Commission Act 1 973 which establishes that the primary obligation of governments is to provide and maintain government school systems of the highest standard which are open without fees or religious tests to all <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister for Education aware that at Yuendumu- an Aboriginal settlement in central Australia- attendance of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> at school is very poor despite the operation of a bilingual program there? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that teachers at the school attribute this poor attendance significantly to the closing by the Fraser Government of the school kitchen which, during the period of the Labor Government, employed Aboriginal mothers to prepare hot midday meals for the <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that the kitchen facilities are now lying idle, the mothers are unemployed and the <span class="highlight">children</span> are malnourished and are absenting themselves from school because they have no food to bring for lunch? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The attendance of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> at Aboriginal schools is a much more complex matter than the honourable senator realises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over the last 5 years there has been a steady decline in the attendance of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> at school, I think to the disappointment and concern of both the Whitlam Government and the Fraser Government and certainly of myself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may also be connected with the strong feeling of parents that they want to bring their <span class="highlight">children</span> nearer to their traditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With regard to the question concerning facilities for providing meals at schools and the other associated nutritional or health matters, my own belief is- I can stand correction on this-that during the period of the Whitlam Government and for some years in any case there has been some argument that it is the responsibility not of schools but of parents to feed <span class="highlight">children</span> properly, because if schools provide meals or clean clothing or shower facilities it takes from the parents a sense of responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator has raised a vital point that concerns those of us who have dealt with Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need to provide a learning environment as well as a healthy environment at school for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> is vital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much of the poor attendance of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> at school in recent years has resulted from a disinclination on the parents’ side to bring the <span class="highlight">children</span> to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year I sat with some Aboriginal elders at a school and suggested to them that they might help by encouraging the <span class="highlight">children</span> to come to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would like to reserve the right occasionally to take our <span class="highlight">children</span> back to our traditional homelands and teach them the true values as we understand them’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is the sum on which these farmers are trying to raise families, to educate <span class="highlight">children</span>, and to send them to the Adelaide University or to colleges of advanced education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, relates to an article in the  Sunday -Mail  of 12 March 1977 concerning assistance to <span class="highlight">children</span> with handicaps resulting from congenital causes or various forms of amputation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that a body called the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Amputee Association has been formed in South Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is she aware of an anomaly which the Association claims has arisen in 2 apparently identical cases for assistance provided under the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance scheme? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to some of the questions raised, I am aware of the formation of the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Amputee Association in South Australia because I have had some correspondence from that Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance scheme is intended to give some assistance to parents who choose to care for their <span class="highlight">children</span> at home rather than to place them in institutions, and to complement the Government’s other schemes of assistance for handicapped persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only hope that good sense will prevail and that the strike will be resolved so that the education ofthe <span class="highlight">children</span> will be, as it always should be, the primary responsibility of the profession and ofthe service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From this, many voluntary organisations sprang up to provide homes for orphans and abandoned <span class="highlight">children</span> and relief in the form of food and clothing for widows, old people, families, and the unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This philosophy may be all very well when it is applied to the wealthy but when it is applied to the thrifty, to the family which has gone without over the years, to the family which has provided for its own home, for better opportunities for the <span class="highlight">children</span>, for retirement and generally for their priorities, and when 50 per cent of the interest their savings earn is taken in income tax, there is no justification for supporting those who will not work or the spendthrifts who live for the day with no thought of their responsibilities for tomorrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last Sunday I took my 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> fishing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that their commitment to the work ethic is not such that they would want to see their <span class="highlight">children</span> digging up roads or working on the assembly line at Ford’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am submitting that  Senator Durack  would inculcate in his <span class="highlight">children</span> exactly the same sort of aspirations that are shared by thousands of Australian parents and thousands of Australian young people about what they want to do in life and the sort of work they want to perform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This decision has resulted in the arrival of over 3.3 million new settlers who, together with their <span class="highlight">children</span> born in Australia, have been responsible for about half of Australia’s postwar growth from 7.4 million to 13.9 million people today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present in these homes there are fourteen or fifteen <span class="highlight">children</span> to only one officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that, if one of the <span class="highlight">children</span> was hurt and had to go to hospital where the child could well wait for two to two and a half hours, the other 14 <span class="highlight">children</span> would be left completely unsupervised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are <span class="highlight">children</span> who have been committed to homes because their parents cannot handle them, they are disadvantaged or they are under mild sentence from the court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the Papunya situation- I mention it only because a group of us went there a couple of weeks ago- we find that there are over 100 <span class="highlight">children</span> in homeland centres outside Papunya who receive no education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That group of <span class="highlight">children</span> has 4 teachers only to look after it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not satisfied that it is sufficiently fitting <span class="highlight">children</span> for the opportunities that society provides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By 1 9 70 this had increased to 55 per cent- substantially over half the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the recent report of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development the comment was made that although <span class="highlight">children</span> stay longer at school they receive no meaningful vocational marketable skills during that extra period of learning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if we are to keep <span class="highlight">children</span> at school for an extra 2 years we must have them leaving school with more chance of fitting into society as it is today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that education has to fit <span class="highlight">children</span> for the life that society has to offer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Particular stress will be placed on meeting the needs of the disadvantaged, including the handicapped, the isolated, migrants and Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Changes in Australia suggest that the number of <span class="highlight">children</span> being cared for by their fathers alone is increasing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A generation ago it would have been almost out of the question for a man to try to look after his <span class="highlight">children</span> by himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This trend is likely to continue, and I think it will increase because more and more mothers are deserting their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generations ago it was very rare for a mother to desert young <span class="highlight">children</span>, particularly those of school or pre-school age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A deserted father should have the same entitlements to social welfare payments as a deserted mother with dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should have some assistance in the form of a taxation concession for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also should like to see some provision whereby employers can make arrangements with employees who are supporting fathers so that they can work hours suitable to their requirements and so that they will be able to look after their <span class="highlight">children</span> and not have to put them, as they now do, into a home or some State institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Prior to the suspension of the sitting I was speaking about the plight and poverty of some of the sole male parents in Australia who are trying to continue to support young <span class="highlight">children</span> and, at the same time, to remain in employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government departments are not geared to assist the sole male parent who comes home and suddenly finds that he must care for his <span class="highlight">children</span> alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A woman who is left to care for her <span class="highlight">children</span> has any number of avenues to turn to for assistancenot necessarily financial assistance, but emotional assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a woman goes to a community welfare department or the Department of Social Security, she is told of the pensions to which she is entitled not only for herself but also for her dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the sole male parent who would like to provide his <span class="highlight">children</span> with a home perhaps would like to provide them also with a substitute mother until he sorts out his affairs and emotions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a sole male parent employs a housekeeper-and frequently we find that he employs someone who has experience with <span class="highlight">children</span> or has a child or <span class="highlight">children</span> of her own- and she is in receipt of a supporting mothers’ benefit or a widows’ pension, her pension could be placed in jeopardy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This does a magnificent job in providing entertainment and looking after the <span class="highlight">children</span> of those people to whom I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This would mean that any pensioner with dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> would receive $8.90 a child a week instead of the present amount of only $7.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the previous Government the husband of a family with 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> received $8.70 tax rebate and $1.50 child endowment, which adds up to $10.20 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where young people cannot get work fathers and mothers tend to agree with newspapers in some ways and call their <span class="highlight">children</span> bludgers and say that they are not trying very hard, that they should be out working and that they are not proper citizens because they are not working an 8-hour day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Harradine  does not know how a woman feels in that situation, nor does he know the misery she feels when she finds herself pregnant and has to cope with the shame, the poverty, the loneliness, the inability to cope with the child or <span class="highlight">children</span> that she may bear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to quote a particularly significant article which appeared in the Medical Journal of Australia in 1970, an article on the syndrome of protein-calorie malnutrition in Australian Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> written by Jose and Welch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This study looked at the growth and development of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> on 6 Aboriginal settlements in Queensland and found that growth retardation, which included brain damage, affected up to 50 per cent of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> aged between 6 months and 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With respect to the problem of nutrition and alcohol, surely it is not beyond any government of goodwill to make adequate protein and calorie diets available where Aborigines are living on settlements, especially to make it available to pregnant women, to babies and to growing <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the <span class="highlight">children</span> of Yuendumu are malnourished, which indeed they are, and if they are living at the settlement as a result of European intrusion into their culture and into their lands, it is not paternalism to provide these facilities; it is simple, basic humanitarianism and responsibility to do as much as possible to rectify the nutrition situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only real alternative for people who cared about the education of their <span class="highlight">children</span> was to send them to private schools which were comparatively very much more expensive in those days than they are today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The overall picture, according to a report published by the United Nations at the beginning of 1970, is that there are today more sick, more undernourished and more uneducated <span class="highlight">children</span> in the world than there were 10 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In developing countries 100 <span class="highlight">children</span> are born every half minute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the mid-1960s, according to the report, the proportion of <span class="highlight">children</span> of school age enrolled in primary schools was 53 per cent in Brazil, 55 per cent in Zambia, 40 per cent in India, 26 per cent in Pakistan and 34 per cent in Burma. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of every 100 <span class="highlight">children</span> entering primary school in developing countries only 30 <span class="highlight">children</span> finished their course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The assumption I make is that we have a large number of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> in the outback who need to be educated, but conditions are such that teachers who come from the southern States find the living conditions very strange. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This scheme must be developed not only because they know the <span class="highlight">children</span> they teach and because they live in the environment in which they have to teach, but also because they bring to the <span class="highlight">children</span> the Aboriginal culture and they give to the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> understanding and confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is a fault within the education system, that is, that we have many young teachers offering their services in the Northern Territory with many going to Aboriginal schools, but in their training facilities, in becoming a teacher, as far as I know there is no curriculum or training in teaching Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> are strange to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of this I do not think they are well suited to teaching Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we have the provision which allows Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> to retain their culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is not carried out we will have a group of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> growing up with no knowledge of their background, their history or their culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall spend a few minutes discussing the problems of educating Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think the educating of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> will be completely successful until many other problems are overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, we should look at the health of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> and Aboriginal people generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On many settlements the <span class="highlight">children</span> are well cared for and healthy but there are many areas where the <span class="highlight">children</span> are living in conditions which are completely different from the way of life they followed as nomads. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that when there is this fragmentation of families and clans who go into the bush with their <span class="highlight">children</span>, there are problems associated with bringing health and education to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> are taken away from school by parents who are going elsewhere to drink. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal people move out from the settlements when they are on the liquor and in these settlements there is neglect of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year in answer to a question on notice regarding the enrolment of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> in the Northern Territory in each pre-school, primary school and secondary school on settlements and missions in the Northern Territory, the Minister indicated that in April last year there were 5316 <span class="highlight">children</span> enrolled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">children</span> were taken too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are very interesting aspects of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> going to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many problems ahead in ensuring that as many Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> as possible are educated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are forgotten people because there is much more concentration these days on the education of Aboriginal people on missions and settlements with insufficient thought given to these part coloured <span class="highlight">children</span> who are living under extreme difficulty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am suggesting that the curriculum is wrong and that these <span class="highlight">children</span>, who are very intelligent, would be much better off if they were trained to use their hands rather than trained for some academic future which is not for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If something is not done for these <span class="highlight">children</span> there will be many social problems ahead for us and I can see these problems occurring already in very many areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After visiting the schools in the Northern Territory, he said: ‘We want schools for the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> of the same standard as those enjoyed by European <span class="highlight">children</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say again that in dealing with education in the schools that we meet the <span class="highlight">children</span> not simply for the delivery of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we ask the <span class="highlight">children</span> why they do not go to school and they say, ‘We do not go because we do not believe that school is for us, we do not believe it is informing us’, who are we to judge? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we examine that as related to a family, we would need to remember that support is added to that for a wife and for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask of the Minister for Social Security a question relating to day care of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is she aware, for example, that no equipment subsidy is provided for private centres but is provided- in fact, everything is provided- for family day care institutions; that the needy parent subsidy applies in the case of <span class="highlight">children</span> in family day care centres but not in the case of private centres; that no standards are set by State legislation for family day care centres- for example, not even a telephone is required to deal with an emergency; and that no safety regulations at present apply in the case of family day care centres but private centres and the community subsidised centres are covered? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The programs for <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services in my Department are subject to review at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have also indicated previously that subsidies for <span class="highlight">children</span> in need in private day care centres can be the subject of discussion and, perhaps, decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Different types of grants are given to family day care programs under the <span class="highlight">children</span> services program; there are equipment grants and operational assistance grant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Family day care was an innovation of the former Government to provide a means of caring for a very limited number of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fewer than 5 <span class="highlight">children</span> usually are cared for in this way and usually they are cared for more on a domesticbasis than on a basis that would be required in a commercial operation in a larger centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They include a man with two <span class="highlight">children</span>, who has hud seven job refusals from the Commonwealth Employment Service since mid January and another with three <span class="highlight">children</span> who has had nine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the most blatant they have handled in recent times was the case of a married man with five <span class="highlight">children</span> who was receiving $ 109 plus endowment weekly and earning up to $40 a duy working privately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, the article states that the man with 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> lives in a caravan and collects $87.50 unemployment relief weekly, plus child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The article also states that the man with 3 <span class="highlight">children</span> owns his own home and collects $104 a week plus endowment, all tax free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I was saying, the man with 3 <span class="highlight">children</span> is stated to own his own home and to collect $104 a week, plus endowment, all tax free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The article states first of all that the alleged dole bludgers include a man with 2 <span class="highlight">children</span> who has refused 7 job offers from the Commonwealth Employment Service since mid-January and another man with 3 <span class="highlight">children</span> who has refused 9 job offers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will persist in its attempt to reduce the number of Aboriginals on the unemployed lists, to reduce the number of school <span class="highlight">children</span> on the unemployed lists, and it will make it more difficult for both these groups to seek jobs and to improve themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter is urgent because those <span class="highlight">children</span> who left school have to be notified of their entitlement and notified to reapply for the benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a preface to providing answers to the question asked by the honourable senator it is necessary to distinguish between two types of possible effects of exposure to ionising radiation which may result in abnormal <span class="highlight">children</span> being born subsequent to the exposure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand there are the developmental abnormalities which may occur in <span class="highlight">children</span> born of mothers who were pregnant at the time of the radiation exposure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These mutations may be manifest in the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the exposed persons when those <span class="highlight">children</span> are conceived subsequent to the radiation exposure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With respect to developmental abnormalities in <span class="highlight">children</span> born of mothers who were pregnant and in the two Japanese cities at the time of the atomic bomb explosions, the qualitative findings of studies on the <span class="highlight">children</span> are that, compared with <span class="highlight">children</span> not exposed to ionising radiation in utero, there was an increased incidence of reduction of height, weight and head and chest circumference measurements which persisted to maturity and an increased incidence of mental retardation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About 13 per cent of a group of <span class="highlight">children</span> irradiated in utero as a result of the atomic bomb explosions showed a mean reduction of head circumference at maturity of about 1 centimetre compared with an incidence of about 4 per cent of a like deformity in a control group of Japanese <span class="highlight">children</span> in utero at the time of the explosions but not exposed to radiation doses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand about 3 per cent of a group of <span class="highlight">children</span> irradiated in utero as a’ result of the atomic bomb explosions showed evidence of some mental retardation compared with an incidence of about 1 per cent in the control group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that many organisations have applied to the Government for funds to run vacation programs for <span class="highlight">children</span> during the May school holidays? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770426_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for Social Security: Will the sum, which I understand to be about $688,000, which was raised and placed in trust by the Spastic Welfare Association of Western Australia for the proposed  Sir David  Brand centre for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>, be matched by a $4 for $1 government contribution in 1977-78 or in subsequent years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770426_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I understand that the current situation with regard to the advertising on radio and television of contraceptives and other aspects of family planning services is that such material may be transmitted provided it is confined to periods outside <span class="highlight">children</span>’s viewing and listening times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770428_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator will know that it is government policy to bring about a direct per capita grant for all parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> in non-government schools and, of course, to recognise need and its supplement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770428_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it true that hundreds of <span class="highlight">children</span> around Australia will now be left to their own devices throughout the fortnight’s break? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770503_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If any further information is required I will provide it to the honourable senator, but I want to say that the expenditure of almost $150,000 on vacation care programs represents a sizable contribution to the care of <span class="highlight">children</span> whose parents are absent from the home and whose parents are unable to plan programs for them during the holiday period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770503_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is it a fact that 27 000 <span class="highlight">children</span> benefited from the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770503_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commonwealth assistance provided in the May 1976 vacation <span class="highlight">children</span>’s care programs whereas only 2 1 000 <span class="highlight">children</span> will benefit from the programs in May of this year, despite the increase in expenditure? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770503_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could be that there is a difference in the number of <span class="highlight">children</span> who will benefit, although I do not know whether that would be the only criteria on which we would judge them entirely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770503_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem to me that the programs that have been chosen on this occasion should provide a variety of occupations and plans for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770503_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that they will be beneficial to the <span class="highlight">children</span> who will attend the programs that have been arranged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770503_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I rang the officer and complained that this man had been unemployed for 6 months; that he was living in one room with 4 <span class="highlight">children</span> in a house that was rented by his mother-in-law; that he was genuinely seeking employment; that he had a job to go to but could not go unless he had about $160 to get his furniture transferred to Blackwood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770503_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a result of the mishandling of this matter by the officers in Adelaide  Mr Duthie  not only lost the job but also lost the opportunity of a house in which he and his 4 <span class="highlight">children</span> could have lived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770503_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those people even started to move furniture into his apartment where he was living with his 4 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770503_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On questioning the then Minister I found that this was a prescription in the Act to stop parents profiting from the death of their <span class="highlight">children</span> or killing their <span class="highlight">children</span> for the benefit they could get from insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Guideline 2 (a) issued by the Minister on 25 March 1976 stated that the present rules provide for the entry of the sponsored spouses and dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> of permanent residents of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that seemed to have been superseded in this case by guideline 2 (a) which stated that the present rules provide for the entry of the sponsored spouses and the dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> of permanent residents of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both the guidelines which applied to this matter from 25 March 1976 and the revised guidelines of 10 September 1976 unequivocally state that the present rules provide for the entry of the sponsored spouses and dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> of permanent residents of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that in many cases the non-Australian country entitles the passport holder to include on the same passport his or her <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Can this lead to such <span class="highlight">children</span> being legally spirited out of this country without the knowledge of the legal custodian? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister request the relevant Ministers to give urgent consideration to this problem with a view to obtaining the restriction of” duality of passports for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of persons who are not their legal custodians? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In answer to a question I asked earlier in the week on holiday care programs for <span class="highlight">children</span>, the Minister advised that the main criterion for funding was that the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is unfortunate that my 3 <span class="highlight">children</span> have passed the age of 10 years before the Government has increased the limits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What pension would the widow and three dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> of a Commonwealth public servant receive from the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-76-14">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>$25,000 paid in a lump sum; and $10 per week in respect of each of the two dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>, payable from the date of  Senator Greenwood  ‘s death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-76-14">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The maximum annual pension payable under the Superannuation Act 1976, where an employee has had less than 3 1 years’ contributory service, to a widow and three eligible <span class="highlight">children</span> is an amount equal to 70 per cent of the deceased’s annual salary at date of death; the percentage is reduced when a child ceases to be an ‘eligible child’ for the purposes of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-76-14">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That present government childcare programs are heavily biassed in favour of pre-school programs, 70 per cent of the funds being destined for pre-schools which only provide part-time services for <span class="highlight">children</span> and do not cater for the needs of working parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-1-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But as a <span class="highlight">children</span>’s benefit was being paid to her parent for her, she was considered not to be eligible for a special benefit in those circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another point that bears mentioning when discussing this group of people is that the particular group of school leavers mostly consists of early school leavers- those who leave at the earliest opportunity, often because of economic necessity, and those school <span class="highlight">children</span> in whom the least amount of the educational dollar has been invested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In terms of our current attitudes towards education, <span class="highlight">children</span> who leave school early often leave through economic necessity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we put those school retention figures together with the study conducted by the Department of Labor and Immigration of unemployed juniors we can see that the unemployed school leavers with whom we are concerned are in general the products of the poorest state schools, they are the <span class="highlight">children</span> who had the least opportunity at school and they are now the members of the work force with the least opportunity to secure employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reality of life in a society such as Australia is that a wage freeze alone cannot be imposed when a company such as the Leyland Motor Corporation of Australia says that it will not be bound by any price freeze; when the Managing Director of Safeways, the supermarket chain, says ‘We will impose a voluntary price pause, but we will review it every day’; when exemptions are announced by the Government the moment the so-called pause is announced; when it does not apply to incomes as distinct from wages; when it does not apply to dividends- numerous companies during the course of the so-called pause announced dividend policies contrary to the guidelines laid down by the Government; when parents of Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> who travelled in the recent school holidays know that motels increased prices for that period; and when a government which promised wage indexation did not keep that promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The situation is still unsatisfactory in that there is still inadequate ancillary staff in the Australian Capital Territory schools and the education of the <span class="highlight">children</span> suffers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Koomarri complex includes a pre-school, a school for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>, sheltered workshops for handicapped persons and various other programs, shops and enterprises which provide income for running the Koomarri organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Expecting that government support would be maintained at previous levels, Koomarri expanded its operations in order to provide more facilities for handicapped persons and <span class="highlight">children</span> in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is estimated that in the financial year ending this month that 200 women and 300 <span class="highlight">children</span> will have used the Canberra Women’s Refuge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This will be a tragedy for Australian society as a whole and for the individual women and <span class="highlight">children</span> who will be forced, because of no option to remain at the mercy of violence and/or alcoholic and mentally cruel husbands and fathers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, in many cases women under pressure from their home situations may finally succumb to the extent of requiring psychiatric and in-patient treatment, with complete care of their <span class="highlight">children</span> usually being taken over by a government institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to correspondence with the Minister concerning handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance and particularly to a letter which I received from the Minister on 5 October 1 976, which stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I recall it, the correspondence  referred to by the  honourable senator referred not so much to an inequity as to a difficulty of some parents of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In terms of Government policy, particularly at a time of consideration of a Budget, I do not have the luxury of being able to speculate on Budget decisions or discussions, but I state again that I hold the view that there is a difficulty for low income families which sustain considerable expense in caring for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> who may not meet the strict medical criteria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that no provision is made indicates there will be no payment to those <span class="highlight">children</span> at least until after 30 June. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister: Where is the provision in these estimates for the payment of benefits to these <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If no provision is made we must consider recommending that provision should be made in these estimates for the payment of benefits to these <span class="highlight">children</span> who I think can meet the criteria and will have to be paid in accordance with Justice Stephen ‘s decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have no doubt that the Department of Social Security will reject his application for a transfer because it would be very happy to see this unemployed worker who is in receipt of sickness benefit forced to go to gaol, and to sacrifice his sickness benefit so that his wife and <span class="highlight">children</span> would have no income and would be forced to apply for community welfare payments from the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it indicates the new emphasis and urgency of the new international economic order, and it is worth recalling that there are now 400,000,000 people in the world suffering from malnutrition, many of them <span class="highlight">children</span>; that the developed world consumes the vast bulk of the world’s resources and that it is necessary that a privileged minority in relation to the rest of the world, such as we are in Australia, should consider our position very carefully and contribute as we are doing, and as this legislation provides, to international assistance funds of this kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that under the new Budget arrangements families with two or more <span class="highlight">children</span> and incomes between $140 and $200 a week will have a lower disposable income than they would have had if the previous indexed rebates for <span class="highlight">children</span> had been retained? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This means that based on the maximum pension rate to commence in November 1977 a single age pensioner without <span class="highlight">children</span> will not have to pay income tax unless his non-pension income exceeds $839. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To continue with the effects on pension recipients, the situation is that because of the sole parent rebate a single pensioner with <span class="highlight">children</span> will be able to receive a higher level of nonpension income than those pensioners without <span class="highlight">children</span> before being required to pay income tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The amount depends on the number of <span class="highlight">children</span> and varies between $2,  1  99 and $3,046 per annum which is equivalent to about $42 and $58 a week respectively in the case of an age or widow pensioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Georges  ought to be aware of the importance of the non-government schools sector to the education of <span class="highlight">children</span> in the many isolated areas of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is better that schools which are established with staff who are motivated and with parents who want to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to the nearest possible school be available to all students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are concerned that no growth means in fact no growth towards equality- no growth on the part of disadvantaged schools in catching up with advantaged schools; no growth in terms of innovations which will bring about better teaching methods and better learning situations for the least advantaged <span class="highlight">children</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why we are concernednot with the amounts of money involved but with the fact that the objectives of the original Karmel Committee which were to bring all schools in Australia, to which all Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> have access, up to a standard which would give roughly equal educational opportunity to all <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we like to think that those things are the case, then surely to aim at providing roughly equal opportunity in education for all Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> is not an extravagant or unreasonable objective, but the progress towards that objective which was started so magnificently during the period of the Whitlam Government when Kim Beazley was Minister for Education has now been stopped, and that is the main basis of our concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again I remind honourable senators that the implications of that in terms of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s education are very serious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s failure to secure funds to maintain the forward planning that he promised when he spoke about the rolling triennium is disastrous and will mean that there will be no constructive planning for education; therefore the education of many <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia will be fragmented and will stop and start. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Traditional barriers between these sectors have been substantially reduced and individuals and groups within them have been encouraged to work together in the common interests of educating all Australian school <span class="highlight">children</span> to the best possible standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No innovations mean that no money is being allocated for thinking and re-looking at the basis of education in order to make education more accessible to more <span class="highlight">children</span> in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a well known phenomenon of education that those <span class="highlight">children</span> who get the most out of traditional methods of education are those <span class="highlight">children</span> who come from the most advantaged families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a well known phenomenon of education that <span class="highlight">children</span> who are disadvantaged generally in socio-economic terms also find themselves disadvantaged when they go into our school system because the school system until now has been a traditional conservative system which did not take account of the special needs and the special difficulties of <span class="highlight">children</span> from lower socio-economic groups or, in the case of Australia, <span class="highlight">children</span> from particular ethnic groups or <span class="highlight">children</span> from the Aboriginal community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Innovation is essential not simply to improve the sort of traditional education which is available and suitable to middle class <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia; innovation is absolutely essential if teachers are to achieve some sort of breakthrough in the teaching, for example, of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>, in the teaching of non-English speaking migrant <span class="highlight">children</span>, in the teaching of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to refer to another area of need which has been raised in the debate tonight, the needs of <span class="highlight">children</span> in isolated areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier this year the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts brought down a very far reaching report on the needs of <span class="highlight">children</span> in isolated areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the <span class="highlight">children</span> who are severely disadvantaged by living in isolated areas are <span class="highlight">children</span> who would want these services provided by the government school sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span> in isolated areas whose parents can afford to send them to boarding schools are <span class="highlight">children</span> who are not particularly disadvantaged by isolation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some financial measures of assistance provided to the parents of those <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">children</span> living in isolated areas who need and want access to government school servicesthat is, basically free services- are the <span class="highlight">children</span> who are not getting them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If supporters of the Government are seriously concerned about the lack of education facilities for <span class="highlight">children</span> in isolated areas, I suggest that they should be particularly concerned by the no-growth policy of the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the area of the education of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>, there is clearly and patently a need for an input of a significant amount of resources if those <span class="highlight">children</span> are to achieve anything like equality of opportunity in education with <span class="highlight">children</span> living in city areas who have access to good government and good nongovernment schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We oppose the approach because it stops that very necessary progress towards the development of equality of opportunity for all Austraiian school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Traditional barriers between these sectors have been substantially reduced and individuals and groups within them have been encouraged to work together in the common interest of educating all Australian school <span class="highlight">children</span> to the best possible standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first interim report of the Karmel Committee recommended that category 1 schools should receive grants of $40 and $65 for primary and secondary school <span class="highlight">children</span> respectively in 1974 and $25 and $35 respectively in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That public concern is expressed by numerous broadcasting consumer groups throughout this country, groups made up of people who are concerned with such questions as the quality of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs on radio and television, ethnic radio, the fact that Australians should be given as wide as possible a choice in the programs that they have available to them on radio and television and the fact that there is no Australian image, if I can use that term, on Australian television but rather an almost total American image of some seven years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned the extension of the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance and the rehabilitation of disabled housewives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Western Australian State Government has made it quite clear that the future of the Lockridge site is tied to the further development of the Pyrton Training Centre for mentally retarded <span class="highlight">children</span> and that its use cannot be extended beyond two years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both the parents of the <span class="highlight">children</span> and the staff at the colleges would be interested to know whether the Department intends to employ Aboriginals to help staff the colleges and, if so, when this is likely to happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Is the Minister for Education aware of the continuing concern of many Australians about the state of health and nutrition among Aboriginal people, especially Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it,  Senator Lajovic  has asked a question regarding the general state of health and nutrition of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> in the Northern Territory and whether any steps are being taken to improve their health and nutrition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that, as all honourable senators know, the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> have inherited from European civilisation a number of quite challenging illnesses, particularly upper respiratory tract infections, middle ear diseases and suppurating ears. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the real problems is that the <span class="highlight">children</span> often come to school illequipped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are taking a lot of measures within schools themselves, in the general treatment of the obvious diseases, in attempts at disinfesting, in trying to provide Oslo type luncheons and in general ablutions for both the <span class="highlight">children</span> and their clothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had discussions with representatives of the Department of Health in recent times in an endeavour to see whether we can get going a pilot scheme of involving trained nursing sisters moving from school to school and carrying out a screening of the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must bear in mind that what we are doing is trying to create not only a currently healthy generation of <span class="highlight">children</span> but also a generation of <span class="highlight">children</span> who will take into their homes a knowledge of health and hygiene for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question by saying that I know the Minister is aware of proposals to close four <span class="highlight">children</span>’s libraries in Canberra on 30 September and of concern expressed about this by many people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the proposed closure of these libraries is only eight days away and in view of representations that have been made, I ask the Minister: Is there any prospect of maintaining the libraries and the services that they provide to the <span class="highlight">children</span> of Canberra? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As the honourable senator would know, I have been concerned for some time about the position relating to the <span class="highlight">children</span>’s libraries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am happy to report that, as a result of representations I have made to the Public Service Board with a view to having the staff ceiling arrangements altered to provide for the continued employment of four part time workers at the <span class="highlight">children</span>’s libraries at Lyneham, O’Connor, Narrabundah and Red Hill, I have been informed that the Board has agreed to my request. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dremmel family, of which 1 am sure the Minister is well aware- a family with many <span class="highlight">children</span> and many problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister has now widened eligibility for the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance to assist low income families, does she envisage this extending to families like the Dremmel family which has <span class="highlight">children</span> with heart troubles, asthma and other physical problems? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I would assure  Senator Grimes  that any <span class="highlight">children</span> in the family which he mentioned who may be eligible for the handicapped child’s allowance could be considered if an application were received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government denied financial support to the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Advancement Society of New South Wales for the running costs of Kirinari Hostels at Sylvania and Newcastle, while agreeing to full financial support if these hostels are taken over and operated by Aboriginal Hostels Ltd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Advancement Society (ACAS) of New South Wales the organisation approached Aboriginal Hostels Ltd (AHL) in November 1976 and requested AHL to take over operations of the ACAS Hostels at Sylvania and Newcastle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers too are saying to <span class="highlight">children</span> as they leave school: ‘Make sure you get the best job you can. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, we find <span class="highlight">children</span> leaving school, often with a higher expectation than their capabilities warrant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme which I have put to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  and which I sincerely hope he will look at is that the <span class="highlight">children</span> who leave school and who are prepared to do the less attractive jobs, the labouring jobs, while they are waiting for the job of their choice ought to be given priority over those <span class="highlight">children</span> who are not prepared to go out and do just any job and are willing to sit around and wait for the job of their choice to come up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We  the  lone fathers of Australia petition the Prime Minister,  Mr Fraser,  to have legislation passed giving assistance to fathers who have custody of and are sole supporters of their dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equal rights with women when claiming custody of their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many lone fathers feel that the interests of their <span class="highlight">children</span> and themselves would be best served if they could receive help in the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Child care provisions for <span class="highlight">children</span> outside the home may satisfy some, but others feel unable to handle the everyday tasks and responsibilities of the home and the <span class="highlight">children</span>, or find that child care facilities do not fit in with shift work hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One lone father told the Commission about his experiences in trying to work and ensure adequate care for his <span class="highlight">children</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have tried pensioners and they cannot cope with the emotionalism of the <span class="highlight">children</span>, the energy of them and the hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other women 1 have tried have been first- and second-year university students who are almost completely naive to <span class="highlight">children</span>’s needs and that has been a failure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have tried final-year high school <span class="highlight">children</span> who start at nine and finish at three. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hours are suitable but I found in general that the <span class="highlight">children</span> were being neglected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were tending to turn the TV on, sit in front of it themselves and expect the <span class="highlight">children</span> to get ready for school, and then leave the house as the <span class="highlight">children</span> did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidence from both lone fathers and <span class="highlight">children</span>’s homes indicates that the lack of options open to lone fathers can mean that these families break up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, a private <span class="highlight">children</span>’s home in Sydney analysed their admission inquiries for the first quarter of 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am inclined to think that maybe, and more likely, rather than looking at a widow or supporting mothers pension or benefit, where there is an assumption that while there are <span class="highlight">children</span> under 16 the pension would be drawn upon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The plight of lone fathers who are struggling to bring up <span class="highlight">children</span> provides another reminder that discrimination is a two-edged sword. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Often the supporting father is in a far worse position to care for <span class="highlight">children</span> than a lone mother; for one thing he is less equipped by nature or training for the task. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus a supporting mother with two school-age <span class="highlight">children</span> can receive a total of $66.10 a weekand under an income test she can earn up to $164.20 a week before the benefit cuts out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the yardstick in such matters should be the wellbeing of the <span class="highlight">children</span> involved, not the sex of sole parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should do no less for lone fathers who stand by their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The thing that interested me about  Mrs Edwards’s  letter to me was that she enclosed a Press release in which she said that the sorts of issues covered in the submissions received from the community and matters raised by the members themselves included the question of increasing the mother’s allowance paid to women pensioners with dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> and the possible extension of this benefit to all lone parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A male marriage partner arrives home in a state of intoxication and proceeds to chastise physically his wife, his <span class="highlight">children</span>, the dog, the cat and anybody who happens to come in his line of fire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I could imagine that person with a brace of young <span class="highlight">children</span>, in the middle of the night with very little money in her pocket, if she is not an independent working person and if her husband does not provide her with a separate housekeeping allowance, being subjected to all types of indignities, grabbing her <span class="highlight">children</span> and perhaps a suitcase and trying to find a refuge, a refuge which has been set up in Australia only in the last few years, to enable her to leave a particularly repulsive situation; a refuge where she knows that she can find a shoulder to cry on if that is what she wants; a refuge where she can find medical assistance if that is what she needs; a refuge where she can find a home for her <span class="highlight">children</span> and for herself until she gets her affairs straightened out; a refuge where her <span class="highlight">children</span> will be looked after and sent off to the necessary schools; a refuge where she will be able to obtain advice about legal matters; and a refuge where she will be informed of her social security rights and all those things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Since the number of bettered women and <span class="highlight">children</span> far exceeds the capacity of present refuges, compelling them to turn away many more than they can assist, it will be seen that if funds are cut any further the position of these women will be indeed desperate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, one of the statements made by the Women’s Electoral Lobby is that 20 to 30 women with their <span class="highlight">children</span> are turned away each day from the five existing women’s refuges in Western Australia, all of which, incidentally, are located in Perth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have had massive expenditure cuts in real terms to most of the needy areas, such as in respect to Aboriginals and the women’s and <span class="highlight">children</span> services about which I have spoken already. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the only means by which they can ensure that their <span class="highlight">children</span> are being clothed, fed, housed and educated and that they have medical and dental treatment available to them when it is required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We had first of all the consumer-led recovery of the economy, but then it was realised that the consumers were not being given a great deal of money and schemes such as that which increased <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowances were introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Government neglected to tell the recipients of that increase in <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowances was that it was going to take the increase back by not allowing them a tax rebate for their <span class="highlight">children</span> at the end of the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their wealth was cattle and <span class="highlight">children</span>, particularly daughters who could be traded for lobola to get more cattle, more wives and then more <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I met mothers who would even go without food so that their <span class="highlight">children</span> could get education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we look at the area of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services we find that this year’s allocation of $73.3m is the same amount as last year but, of course, in real terms it is a reduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The limitations on funds for capital grants in the area of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services means that there will virtually be no new community based child care projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a publication of the Australian Bureau of Statistics of 8 November 1977 which gives these figures:  222,000 <span class="highlight">children</span> under 12 years of age not attending school were the responsibility of persons who worked away from home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is more than a quarter of a million Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> need some form of child care services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those figures indicate clearly that there is a very vast need for <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services- not only for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of working parents but also for <span class="highlight">children</span> in many circumstances- which is not being met and which will not be met from the allocation in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whereas a couple of years ago the national capital was a thriving, growing and expanding centre providing more and more services to the rest of the nation, a city with many job opportunities for <span class="highlight">children</span> growing up here, a city with opportunities for people in business and for the whole range of private enterprise, it is now a place with opportunities for virtually no one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister for Education seen the September-October edition of the Queensland  P. &amp; C. Guide  which in its editorial claims that the Government has moved against <span class="highlight">children</span> in State schools with a cynicism that must shock all thinking people in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are problems which cause anxiety to parents who have <span class="highlight">children</span> leaving school, to the parents of some 200,000 <span class="highlight">children</span> who will leave school in November and December this year- many of them, perhaps, with not great academic records. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The lack of job opportunities causes concern to parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> leaving school, and they cause a concern and disillusionment amongst young people themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> are rejecting school because it does not lead anywhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once we were able to say to Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>: ‘Come to school, get a good education and you will be able to leave school and get a good job’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">children</span> have rejected this idea and they have rejected school with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What incentives do these younger <span class="highlight">children</span> at school have to study hard? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same survey we find that 7,400 single mothers with dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> were looking for work and were unable to find it, probably for the variety of reasons I have already stated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What honourable senators may be aware of is that if women with dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> are looking for work and cannot find it their fate, of course, is to be relegated to the supporting mothers’ benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet that is the fate facing 7,400 women with the care of dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> who are unable to find work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Walters interjects to say that their <span class="highlight">children</span> are assisted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the assistance to the <span class="highlight">children</span> of supporting mothers amounts to about $7.50 a week which  Senator Walters,  who I understand is a parent herself, may realise is a hopelessly inadequate proportion of what it actually costs to support a child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the sake of people listening to this debate, I should like-to clarify the claim that somehow the family allowance should satisfy supporting mothers who are seeking to rear <span class="highlight">children</span> alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any mothers who are listening to the debate will be aware that the family allowance in the case of a mother with two <span class="highlight">children</span> amounts to the princely sum of $8.50 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that even  Senator Walters  would have the hide to claim that $8.50 a week represents anything approximating what it costs to rear two <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What happened in the meantime was that many of these families, particularly migrant families who came to Australia to establish themselves, to get themselves a home- which perhaps was one of their main objectives in leaving the country of their birth- during the period of the 1950s and 1960s committed themselves to large mortgage repayments and to education expenses for their <span class="highlight">children</span> and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Has the Minister for Social Security seen the figures on the poverty line which were released yesterday, I understand, by Professor Henderson, and in particular the claim that many large families are now falling even further below the poverty line, although the breadwinner is an income earner, and also that large families with <span class="highlight">children</span> are badly affected? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By educating the masses one would be putting them on a parity with the people who can afford to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to private schools and afford to spend money on buying them books so that they can study at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The very way in which this Government has reduced this Budget deficit has brought great hardship and suffering upon the <span class="highlight">children</span> of working class families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government certainly increased the family allowance, but a husband cannot now claim a rebate in his taxation return for his dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very effect of the measure that the Government has brought in has been an increase in the maintenance payment to a mother and her <span class="highlight">children</span> and a decrease in the wherewithal of the father himself to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for Education: Is it a fact that in 1976-77 the Tasmanian Minister for Education,  Mr Batt,  underspent the loan funds appropriation for primary schools by $1.7m; that in respect of the Consolidated Revenue appropriation for 1976-77, out of 39 items, in 22 cases the Minister for Education spent less than the estimated amounts appropriated by the Tasmanian Parliament in the 1976 Budget; and that one of those items cut was the State’s contribution towards the cost of meals for <span class="highlight">children</span> at special schools? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said here in a speech the other day, until we came to office it was always the philosophy of the Liberal Party that the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the masses, of the working class, were not entitled to a decent education in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any housewife can reduce her deficit if she is running up a bill at her local shop if she cuts down on food, clothing and whatever she might need to provide for her husband and her <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of this country would far sooner have a deficit Budget and be provided with the essentials of life, something that is there for all time and something which they, their <span class="highlight">children</span> and their <span class="highlight">children</span>’s <span class="highlight">children</span> can use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike the silvertails and the people who come from Burnside, Toorak- where  Senator Cormack  lives- and up on the North Shore, who go overseas for a trip and send their daughters to finishing school whenever they have some surplus money, the working man spends his surplus money on getting a decent house to live in and a better education for his <span class="highlight">children</span>, something that is of lasting benefit to the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us recall also that the Government has decided to increase the additional boarding allowance for isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> from $450 to $500 a year in 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has also relaxed the means test by increasing the marginally adjusted family income for tertiary education and related schemes and for the additional boarding allowance for isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> from $8,200 to $8,700 in 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, in a number of important areas, areas where people are greatly endangered in their efforts to obtain education for their <span class="highlight">children</span>, there have been increases even in a year when the belt-tightening will have to continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But very huie is said about Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> in isolated areas, and something has happened there over the last few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are more and more Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>, and the immense problem that I,  Senator Carrick  and others see is that of the young <span class="highlight">children</span> coming forward with very few jobs available for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the result will be that in the next few years many Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> will be without a position - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Positions have to be found for those Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to repeat that so that it is clearly understood: The bunging up of <span class="highlight">children</span> is perhaps the most important job that any person can undertake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe families, including <span class="highlight">children</span>, will be happy if women who have skills and expertise are discriminated against in the work force as used to be the case in the 1950s and 1960s before we had equal pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A comparison of the after tax income of families with two to five <span class="highlight">children</span> and incomes between $120 and $200 a week was produced by the statistical service of the Parliamentary Library. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it pointed out repeatedly that unless regular increases were made m the new family allowances to cope with inflation many people- those people with <span class="highlight">children</span>- would suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We voiced our suspicions, and our suspicions have been confirmed, that one of the reasons that the new allowances were introduced was to avoid the consequences of having indexed <span class="highlight">children</span>’s rebates under the previous system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of this, together with the Government’s system of industrial confrontation, its determination to cut real wages, its failure to increase payments to those who are in real need such as pensioners with <span class="highlight">children</span>, and its failure to increase the family allowances in fact will reduce the living standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we talk about youngsters in our sort of society, knowing how bad it is for some of them in the areas in which we all move, imagine how bad it must be for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another group in society that will be completely locked out or will finish up with all the filthy, low-paid jobs that nobody ever wants to do is the <span class="highlight">children</span> who were bora outside Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">children</span> who are still at school have an apathy about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are <span class="highlight">children</span> who are tentative about life outside school walls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Teachers are saying to the <span class="highlight">children</span> now: ‘It is no good thinking you will come back to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If you finish with learning- as many <span class="highlight">children</span> of 16 and 17 years of age do- the place for you is in the community’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">children</span> do not have a place in the education system or in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their parents look at them and wonder why the <span class="highlight">children</span> do not try to get a job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The parents do not understand how hard it is for the <span class="highlight">children</span> to get jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have heard of no government schemes to help these <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of spending the money on those sorts of advertisements that are blatant untruths, the Government could have put that money into some sort of scheme to create jobs for the <span class="highlight">children</span> who have not them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has schemes for keeping <span class="highlight">children</span> quiet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not schemes that will supply jobs for these <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why can a scheme not be brought in actually to give <span class="highlight">children</span> apprenticeships and not just pay employers to entice them to take on apprentices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should put some of the responsibility back on the employers to take <span class="highlight">children</span> in as apprentices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has to use the muscle it has- if, as  Senator Cotton  says, it has that muscle- to make sure that jobs are available and that there are not just job schemes dreamt up to keep <span class="highlight">children</span> quiet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The support scheme that was brought in is supplying some sort of employment for <span class="highlight">children</span> who have been unemployed for six months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What sort of scheme is the Government bringing in to help those sort of <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These are our <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yesterday the Minister wrote back to me, refusing to recognise the particular needs of single parents who must pay for child care and refusing to recognise the anomalies that occur in that an individual is assessed for rental rebate in exactly the same way as a person with four or five dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have three ‘Lone Parent’ friends who weighed the pros and cons and left their jobs, because they were that much better off on the pension and they have the pleasure of bringing up their <span class="highlight">children</span> and not having to pay the exorbitant money to somebody else to help them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He has to pay $30 a week for after-school minding for his <span class="highlight">children</span> and in school holidays $40 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pensioners can do so, but virtually no wage earner can obtain a rebate because no allowance is made for dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> or child care fees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We the lone fathers of Australia petition the Prime Minister,  Mr Fraser,  to have legislation passed giving assistance to fathers who have custody of and are sole supporters of their dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equal rights with women when claiming custody of their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it has to be recognised that sole parents, lone parents in large numbers, often with young <span class="highlight">children</span>, represent a relatively new phenomenon in our society, but an increasingly prevalent one, to which governments have to give increasing attention and that adequate benefits have to be provided for these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the suggestions were a holiday camp on the South Coast, a holiday farm, a nudist camp, scholarships for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of staff, an alpine lodge in the Snowy Mountains, donations to charity, canteen facilities, a child care centre, a do-it-yourself car service facility, a fishing lodge in the Jindabyne area, a gymnasium, and a heated swimming pool. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And I’m sick of paying taxes so that farmers can preserve their assets for their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A national advertising campaign ought to be conducted to encourage <span class="highlight">children</span>, through the schools and in the family home itself, to turn the lights off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for Education whether he has seen a report in the Sydney  Sunday Telegraph  of 16 October, stating that the Federal Government is considering a radical plan to give parents money vouchers to pay for their <span class="highlight">children</span>’s education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there will be a long term bad effect not only on the Aboriginal adults but also on their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can make available to people, whether Aborigines or not, opportunities for better education and health facilities, but unless their <span class="highlight">children</span> can come home to a decent home with an environment where they can sit down and do their homework, it is all to no avail;  so housing is  a very important factor for consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most important thing to me,  Senator Georges,  is that Aboriginal people, Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>, get into a decent house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Government sets aside a certain amount of money there are many rip-offs in many areas, and I would say that 75 per cent of the money set aside by the Government is going in rip-offs for feasibility studies and other studies instead of going to the grass roots level where it is needed, where babies are dying, where <span class="highlight">children</span> are sleeping eight and ten to a room. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when unions get to the stage of holding the whole nation and the people to ransom without regard for the suffering of women and <span class="highlight">children</span>, it is time we took a second look at ourselves as Australians and asked: ‘What are we doing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even those families that are nuclear families with mother, father and <span class="highlight">children</span> do not have the support usually of uncles, aunts and grandparents in times of stress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister for Education been drawn to a report in this morning’s  Canberra Times  of a new concept in bi-lingual education for migrant <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I recall it, the report indicated that the school is interested in bi-lingual learning in the conscious knowledge that <span class="highlight">children</span> from the wide migrant communities have difficulties in learning in a second language but have much more ability to learn initially in their own language and then make the translation into English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia, could do much not only to help the migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> in their difficulties in that multiculture but also to give to the Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> a glimpse of the richness of the other cultures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rate of inflation has destroyed the expectations which people had in the past to quietly and confidently enjoy the security of a long-term job and the hopes of their <span class="highlight">children</span> to partake in job opportunities in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He should be entitled to free medical treatment, free education for his <span class="highlight">children</span>, guaranteed employment and a decent home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know of several cases where juveniles have been questioned, with certain officers making vague threats to the <span class="highlight">children</span> saying that if they did not tell them certain things etc., they could be sent to a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the last 2 months, a number of young Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> were picked up by police and questioned at some length. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Three years ago on this settlement there had been murder, manslaughter, maiming of people, drunkenness, broken families, <span class="highlight">children</span> neglected and the Appatula housing association was in pieces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As background information, I point out that at one school at least in the Australian Capital Territory in recent days people, apparently representing the organisation known as the <span class="highlight">Children</span> of God, have been handing out rather strange literature to pupils arriving at the school and have tried to get these young people to join their organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of concern that has been widely expressed about this organisation and its activities relating to young people and the natural anxiety of parents when <span class="highlight">Children</span> of God seek recruits in the immediate vicinity of schools, can the Minister say whether any action can be taken to restrict such activities near schools and attempts to have young people join an organisation such as the <span class="highlight">Children</span> of God? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has always been my view that once my <span class="highlight">children</span> leave the school gate they are my responsibility and not the school’s responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not expect a headmaster or a headmistress to look after <span class="highlight">children</span> apart from the time when the <span class="highlight">children</span> are at school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will, however, draw the attention of my colleague the Minister for the Capital Territory to this matter because he may have some jurisdiction once those <span class="highlight">children</span> leave school and are between school and their home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am confident that if the people of Australia have to pass judgment on this Government for doing what it can to destroy industrial anarchy, to restore the legitimate right of the individual trade unionist to work and to provide a meal for his wife and <span class="highlight">children</span>, the people of Australia will support this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that at the moment men might be the greater drunks, but they are addicted also to tobacco; that at the moment women might be in even greater danger with the use of analgesics and sedatives, but they are turning increasingly also to tobacco and alcohol; that our <span class="highlight">children</span> are turning increasingly to alcohol and tobacco and we are afraid that they are now turning also to cannabis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My inquiry of the Minister for Education is based on the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts and in particular its recommendations concerning the education of isolated school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I may add that it represents the study and practical experience of people from isolated areas with a concern for the education of their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, what progress has been made in giving effect to the recommendation concerning the role of the Curriculum Development Centre and the provision of suitable material for <span class="highlight">children</span> who live in isolated areas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-To answer fully the honourable senator’s important but multifaceted question would take longer than Question Time would permit, but I well recall my membership of that Committee, travelling extensively throughout Australia and meeting some first class people who, in the isolated areas, take a lively interest in the education of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, in recent weeks I revisited some of those areas: For instance I visited Wentworth at the junction of the Darling and the Murray, and spoke to people in the isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>’s field, from the whole of the western lands division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, let me say this: The best way, apart from these measures, to assist the parents of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> is to do what this Government is doing, namely, to bring down the rate of inflation which over the years of the Whitlam Government added enormously to the burdens of costs on these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those fields, the Government is very active and is active, of course, in the general field of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This relieving power will ensure that ordinary trusts for <span class="highlight">children</span> under 16 years of age will not be called on to pay tax where the income is under $1,041. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Last year the Victorian Government provided for exemption in respect of an estate passing between spouses and from 1 January 1978 estates which pass to <span class="highlight">children</span> will be exempt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many programs of great benefit to <span class="highlight">children</span> have been administered by voluntary agencies and by the States during the long vacation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does his transference of about $5m of the taxpayers money from government schools to elite private schools mean that the Government wishes to increase educational opportunities of already privileged <span class="highlight">children</span> at the expense of the disadvantaged <span class="highlight">children</span> in government schools and the least affluent non-government schools? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If she had spoken on the basis of equality of opportunity for all school <span class="highlight">children</span> she might have been heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the very wording of the question which I put to the Minister I referred to the disadvantaged <span class="highlight">children</span> in the non-government schools, that is, the level six schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This should not be confused with handicapped child’s benefit which is paid at $5 per day for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> residing in an approved home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These expenses can arise out of the need to provide special footwear or other clothing, special diets or specific medical or remedial treatment that the parents of other <span class="highlight">children</span> are not required to provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where there are <span class="highlight">children</span>, additional benefit of $7.50 a week is payable for each child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new benefit will be payable to all fathers bringing up <span class="highlight">children</span> on their own and will come into effect on the date the Bill receives the Royal Assent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fathers who have already been supporting their <span class="highlight">children</span> for six months or more will become eligible immediately the Bill becomes law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus a supporting father with two <span class="highlight">children</span>, one of whom is under six years of age may receive, subject to the income test, a total benefit of $70.30 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It put forward many arguments why State and local governments should be responsible for the aged, the handicapped, <span class="highlight">children</span>- almost everyone in the communitybut, in fact, its aim essentially was artificially to cut the Government’s Budget deficit and transfer that sort of expenditure out of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some programs which were considered by Bailey were axed by the present Government but most of them, such as the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act, the aged and disabled persons home program, the <span class="highlight">children</span> services program and the community health programs are continuing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the unemployed, parents of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>, pensioners or anyone else need to appeal against a bureaucratic decision of the Government or its servants, they should be able to appeal on clear grounds that are written in legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am quite sure that every honourable senator in this place knows of many <span class="highlight">children</span> who have applied for the unemployment benefit during their Christmas holidays and have gone back to school after the vacation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Parents are being asked to support their <span class="highlight">children</span> for just an additional six weeks while they seek employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that <span class="highlight">children</span> have claimed the unemployment benefit while they have been on holiday and this Government is taking action to stop this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will cover all fathers bringing up <span class="highlight">children</span> on their own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once a father has supported <span class="highlight">children</span> for six months he will become eligible for the same benefit as that received by the supporting mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask whether the Government or the Minister has considered the social cost of introducing this provision, whether it has considered the cost to the low income family that needs some income from its school leaving <span class="highlight">children</span> by way of wages or, in the case of unemployed <span class="highlight">children</span>, by way of unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has it considered what will happen to those low income families which have a lot of <span class="highlight">children</span> to support- perhaps there is sickness in the family- and which need to send their teenagers out into the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What will be the social cost of depriving those families of the assistance which they reasonably might have expected from their teenage <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What might very easily happen is that, because he is sick and there are <span class="highlight">children</span> and so forth, the wife may have to give up her job to care for the husband and the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that the poverty line as defined in the income figures for the June quarter of 1977 for a married couple with two <span class="highlight">children</span> was $111.90 a week, which represents a yearly income of about $6,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That figure represents the poverty line where the income earner has to support a non-working spouse and two <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the staff now employed by the Department of Social Security be able to keep to the time table which the Minister for Social Security has spelt out in the Bill or will people without incomes be deprived of the wherewithal to feed their wives and <span class="highlight">children</span> and themselves and pay all their commitments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has no consideration for people on the lower structure of income and their wives and <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Payne said he would defy the Minister fo Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  by forcing the unemployment issue at the meeting called to discuss <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Otherwise, it will be a very bleak Christmas indeed for many hundreds of thousands of men, women and <span class="highlight">children</span>, because parents do not have a fulltime job and cannot provide for their families the most meagre Christmas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cited the case of husbands who were either separated from their wives or divorced, and had court orders against them for maintenance; that they now found that they could not claim reimbursement in their income tax returns for the support of dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>; that they were paying an extra amount by way of maintenance because of that fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People in a slightly higher income bracket are now finding that they are in circumstances similar to those on lower incomes because, they cannot claim a tax deduction for maintenance payments to dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many cases a man who has been divorced has remarried and has <span class="highlight">children</span> of the second marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a benefit that will be paid in relation to <span class="highlight">children</span> who do not reach the medical criteria of the handicapped child ‘s allowance but who have other needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The types of expenditure that would be acceptable for the purpose would be such things as expenditure on medical and paramedical services, especially physiotherapy, after the deduction of health insurance refunds, the cost of transport incurred in seeking medical and other services, expenditure on special diets, prosthesis, spectacles and mobility aids, such as wheelchairs, expenditure on clothing in excess of the usual requirements, expenditure on shoes in excess of the usual requirements, school fees in excess of the usual cost, usually arising out of attendance at a special school, and expenditure on occasional child care and special activities- for example, swimming lessons for spastic <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were able also to set up a meeting between State and Federal governments to arrange a three-year program for <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services, starting from the Budget next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another matter raised, although not in the context of the Bill before the Senate, was that of family allowances and the difficulties encountered by some fathers who are paying maintenance for <span class="highlight">children</span> who no longer are in their custody, care and control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was stated then, and it still would be valid as far as I am concerned, that any father who is paying a maintenance order for <span class="highlight">children</span> could apply to the court for a review of that maintenance order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposal widens the eligibility for allowance to include those <span class="highlight">children</span> who do not meet the medical criteria which presently exist but who are substantially handicapped and have a continuing expenditure for their special needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allowance was to be paid to families who cared for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> in their own homes as an alternative to institutional care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We felt that there were <span class="highlight">children</span> with a degree of handicap which would warrant assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because of this that we have introduced a flexible arrangement under which we are able to determine the substantial handicaps of <span class="highlight">children</span> who need continuing expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that this system provides a flexibility which will mean that more handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> will benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one of my <span class="highlight">children</span> leaves school two years hence he may well go on a holiday, knowing that I am so soft hearted, but he would certainly not be legally entitled to collect unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are people who have one, two or three <span class="highlight">children</span> and who are on award wages as the fitter and turner is on award wages in Tasmania of about $ 1 37 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When their <span class="highlight">children</span> leave school they frequently need to get a job to help support themselves and their families but they cannot get jobs under the present circumstances although they are available for work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To have a better chance of getting work they need to have a small amount of money to help them with their dress and with transport and in the case of rural <span class="highlight">children</span>, amongst whom the unemployment rate is very high, who may need to travel to the city to have any hope of getting work, they certainly need the $49 or whatever it is to assist them in getting work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where a parent was receiving a rate of unemployment benefit which took into account dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>, that additional payment would be continued during the period of six weeks before eligibility for unemployment benefit had been achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When one considers that a child of a person receiving the unemployment benefit is going to be considered by the Government to be satisfactorily paid if his or her parent receives the <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance plus the family allowance, which might add up to about $7 or $8 a week, one can imagine what sort of restrictions are going to be applied before anyone will be eligible for special benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What the Opposition is pointing out is that the Government is considerably adding to those difficulties and adding to those difficulties where the people can least cope with those difficulties, namely, in respect of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of people who are unemployed, the <span class="highlight">children</span> of low income earners- the poor people in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These are: General resources programs- general recurrent grants, including funds for child migrant and multicultural education, emergency aid for nongovernment schools, and capital grants and specific purpose programs- disadvantaged schools and schools in disadvantaged country areas, special education for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> including <span class="highlight">children</span> living in institutions, services and development including education centres, and special projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The base program for migrant and multicultural education is the same in total as for 1977, but has been adjusted between States and systems to bring the payments more into line with the actual distribution of migrant <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recalling the fact that the Minister has received many representations from the outback of Australia, particularly in regard to disadvantaged <span class="highlight">children</span>, disadvantaged schools and disadvantaged country areas, is he in a position to indicate whether these specific purpose programs will be of benefit to these outback areas where isolation and economic pressures are causing considerable hardship? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular the Federal Government has expanded its help through the isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>’s schemes, both through the raising of allowances and, in particular, through the special boarding allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government is very conscious of the fact that in remote areas isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> suffer an extreme disadvantage, particularly because of the beef prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most of all I do not think it is sufficient ground on which to defer a program that can mean so much to <span class="highlight">children</span> who would otherwise be blind early in their lives as a result of this terrible disease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have found that many Australian teachers- up to 75 per cent of their pupils having come from some other country- find difficulty in understanding the behaviour of migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> because they do not understand or know nothing about the habits and customs of those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We also recognise that the various forms of the media are so powerful in their effect on citizens and on growing <span class="highlight">children</span> that they present an instrument which is very open to manipulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the moment a number of honourable senators are members of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts which is inquiring into the effect of television on <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware of the representations which have been made, again, particularly from Victoria, by members of parliament and by organisations in regard to <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television programs, which they regard as being quite inadequate and which I regard as being quite inadequate and unsatisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One wonders whether people who watch television, who have <span class="highlight">children</span> and who are concerned about programs will have an interest in the view of the Tribunal, so that they will be allowed to appear before the Tribunal and set out their cases against a television or radio station, suggesting that those stations should or should not receive renewals of their licences et cetera because of the standards they have set perhaps over a period of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Supplementary benefits to the recipients of sickness benefits and the allowances for spouses and <span class="highlight">children</span> for those people on unemployment benefits, sickness benefits and special benefits under this Government are now taxed for the first time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we pointed out at the time of its introduction that if the family allowance were introduced in this way and if tax rebates for <span class="highlight">children</span> were abolished, if justice was to be maintained, it was essential that that family allowance should be regularly upgraded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have produced tables, never questioned in the Parliament, which demonstrate that with the introduction of the Medibank levy and of the family allowance and with the scrapping of the <span class="highlight">children</span>’s rebates which would have been indexed, what has happened is that anyone earning $120 to $200 a week who has more than one child has less disposable income now than he would have had under the old tax scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the same recommendation Professor Henderson recommended that the supporting mothers’ benefit should be a Commonwealth responsibility, and that to maintain justice in the community home care help, infant welfare, child care and general accommodation services for women in distress and <span class="highlight">children</span> in distress should be upgraded and should be funded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This would be all very well if the Government were paying the relocation allowances only to single persons because generally they have not too many ties in the towns in which they are living, but what about the married man with <span class="highlight">children</span> going to school, the man who has bought a house and is paying it off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister spoke about how the Government by way of the family allowance, had put a great deal more money into the hands of those who normally bear most of the day to day responsibility for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now he has so much less in his pay packet because he is not able to claim his <span class="highlight">children</span> as a taxation deduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Neither the tax rebates previously allowable for dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> and students, nor the concessional deductions which preceded them, were ever indexed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main reason for abolishing tax rebates and introducing family allowances for dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> and students was a redirect assistance towards families most in need, namely those with insufficient taxable income, and therefore insufficient gross tax liabilities, to take full advantage of the former tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the last few weeks we have had question after question being put in this chamber to the Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick)  by Government senators- we call them Dorothy Dixers- in response to which he has made it quite clear that he is happy to see the old State aid debate reactivated in this country, to the detriment of all school <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, these are payments to <span class="highlight">children</span> who are under the age of 16 years, and they continue until such time as those <span class="highlight">children</span> are eligible for the unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been introduced to free women from having <span class="highlight">children</span>, so that they can be sold into slavery all their lives, doing two jobs I might suggest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The womenfolk and <span class="highlight">children</span> of these men also suffer hardship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another advertisement showed a woman with two <span class="highlight">children</span> and a spiel that indicated that with the Liberals’ child endowment increases she would be much better off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The advertisement did not mention that the Government had taken away the tax concessions for dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, the average woman with two dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> would be considerably worse off financially because of the removal of the tax concessions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The initiatives of the Government in taking action to ensure that parents of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> will pay no more for the education of their <span class="highlight">children</span> than the parents of other <span class="highlight">children</span> pay and also in providing further facilities for the education of <span class="highlight">children</span> in isolated areas are also to be commended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Professor Urie Bronfenbrenner, who is regarded as a world authority on the welfare of <span class="highlight">children</span> and who wrote a magnificent article on the family entitled ‘The Origins of Alienation’, which appeared in the  Scientific American,  has said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I deal in some detail with this matter because of its great political significance in terms of the ultimate costs to the nation of social services which are required following broken marriages, particularly where <span class="highlight">children</span> are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is trite to say that a continuing and happy family with both parents accepting their responsibility for the love and care of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the marriage is in the long run a saving to the state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could almost say that a happy and stable marriage where the parents care for the <span class="highlight">children</span> without resource to social sendee payments is a very relevant factor in the social services budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Family Law Act does not really protect the <span class="highlight">children</span> of a marriage for the trauma of a breakdown in that marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inevitably this means suffering for the innocent <span class="highlight">children</span> of the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Family Law Act has made it very easy for a marriage to be dissolved, the custody of the <span class="highlight">children</span> and the property settlement are still matters over which the parties argue, very often to the distress of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the marriage who, I think, are the major concern of all of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The truth is that managing a home and <span class="highlight">children</span> can be a full time job until the <span class="highlight">children</span> are grown up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bureau of Statistics figures for 1975 indicate that there were 505,300 married women and 23,300 other females without <span class="highlight">children</span> under eleven in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Surveys by the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the Electrical Trades Union of New South Wales showed that those married women who have <span class="highlight">children</span> but who are currently in the work force would prefer to stay at home and care for their <span class="highlight">children</span> if they were paid a relatively small amount of money for doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand, our <span class="highlight">children</span> were allowed to walk into Parliament House without their bags and so on being searched. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not a reflection on the staff of Parliament House, all of whom know my <span class="highlight">children</span>, but it is a reflection on civilian security staff, who ought to have known what they were doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When discussing the social effects of unemployment it is important that we do not forget the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unemployment does have an effect on <span class="highlight">children</span> in a family where unemployment is prevalent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus it is not long before those families feel the full financial blow of unemployment, and quite often the <span class="highlight">children</span> suffer because of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a small school at Abercorn and the risk of losing those families is that the school will have to close and the <span class="highlight">children</span> from that school will have to travel by bus to Mulgildie, which is rather further than they have to travel to Abercorn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Parents in the Abercorn district are faced with the prospect of having to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> on 50-mile and 60-mile journeys each day so that they can attend school, or else of sending them to a boarding school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The families in the beef-raising areas of Queensland, certainly parents in this area who have a fairly young family, cannot afford to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to boarding school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their only alternative is to have their <span class="highlight">children</span> go through a very rigorous journey so that they can attend school each day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Also their <span class="highlight">children</span> ought to have reasonable access to a decent education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Should he have to face the situation of moving his home, going away from friends and his place of employment so that his <span class="highlight">children</span> may- I stress the word may’- have the opportunity of getting work in a larger town or city? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time in many suburban schools- I have no doubt that the situation applies in the rural area as well- we find classrooms with split grades and a teacher trying to educate anything up to 38 or 40 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first instance, I am concerned that the statutory responsibility of the Director, Department of <span class="highlight">Children</span> ‘s Services is being ignored as a result of substantial funding to a voluntary agency proposing to work in the field of child welfare, and, secondly, that consultation at an appropriate level concerning the proposed funding had not taken place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I expressed my concern that the rural areas are the hardest hit but in some cases it is necessary for men, with families grown up and in need of employment, to determine whether it is of more benefit to them to leave their homes, their friends, and their work in the hope that their <span class="highlight">children</span> may get employment in a larger town or in the city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said in my speech- and I will repeat it again now- that the <span class="highlight">children</span> may get employment but they may not get employment and the possibility of one parent or both parents getting employment is much less than it is for the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that I abhorred the fact that in some classrooms there were as many as 38 <span class="highlight">children</span> and further, to confuse both students and teachers, that some of those classrooms contained split grades. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I noted with appreciation the reference in  His  Excellency’s Speech to the Government’s proposal to provide further assistance for education of <span class="highlight">children</span> in isolated areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The matter of the education of <span class="highlight">children</span> in isolated areas was referred from the Senate to the Senate Committee on Education and the Arts, which later brought down a report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More assistance is to be given to disadvantaged people and their <span class="highlight">children</span>, of whom there are many in Australia today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question to the Minister for Education concerns the reference in the Speech of the Governor-General, which I mentioned last night, to the provision of further assistance for the education of <span class="highlight">children</span> in isolated areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pursuant to its announcement, the Government at present is undertaking a further survey in the areas of both isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> and handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>, which are often overlapping in their implications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can indicate to  Senator Davidson  that we are very conscious of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts and the work that was done on isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Vast numbers of them send their <span class="highlight">children</span> away to secondary schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He sends three of his own primary school age <span class="highlight">children</span> to England for their education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will now be counted because the number of <span class="highlight">children</span> has risen, so perhaps we can keep the level the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a glimmer of light, and I am sure that Senators Davidson and Martin, as well as other senators on both sides of the chamber, will be pleased to learn that further assistance will be provided for the education of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the major fundamental reforms announced first of all in the Prime Minister’s policy speech and referred to in the GovernorGeneral ‘s address is that in future handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> will be educated so that the costs to their parents will be no greater than the costs to parents of other <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For too long in our society and in most others handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> and adults have faced not only the physical, visual or intellectual handicaps that they may have but also the additional handicaps they encounter within society with problems ranging from the cost of medical care and education to simpler but no less important matters such as access to buildings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past two years the Government has done a good deal, for example, by the improvements in the handicapped child’s allowance and the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Foster Grandparents program, which is also for people over 60 years of age, permits older people to act as grandparents to <span class="highlight">children</span>, frequently handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>, and provide care and attention which otherwise might be lacking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one adds to that the kind of separation factor which is now of two years’ standing and the stress that causes to women with <span class="highlight">children</span> who are on their own in Australia, one sees that a very real social problem is developing about which we believe the Government should be quick and alert to do something. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaving aside the many problems that undoubtedly exist, such as the situation of the 200 Timorese <span class="highlight">children</span> in Melbourne who have no special teaching facilities or help of any kind available to them and who are in a difficult and desperate position, we have a community in Australia which is upset and distressed about a situation in its homeland and a community which is upset and distressed about the real social problems that exist for it in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  150  to  200  people, including many <span class="highlight">children</span>, who came there were, I think, people who are very thankful for the opportunity of living in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these things are emphasised even more by reason of the fact that these people are mostly women and <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that document the Council speaks of family units and family reunions and points out that a degree of affinity has to be permitted, but that in general there might be good reasons for limiting entry to parents and single <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other day we saw two ladies who have 10 <span class="highlight">children</span> between them- they have five each- and whose husbands are in Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These women were helping not only to support their <span class="highlight">children</span> but also they were attempting to help their husbands and other <span class="highlight">children</span> in Timor by trying to get money through to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is better for the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fear these people have is that their <span class="highlight">children</span> will grow up without the control of a father and they will have problems with them in later life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The acceptable categories for entry will be spouses, minor dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>, parents of Australian residents and relatives who have skills and experience recognised and in demand in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Through the Office of Child Care under my Department, we have been aware of the need to help refugee <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Another matter of continuing concern to me is that of refugee <span class="highlight">children</span> who come here as double orphans or who are likely to become double orphans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say on behalf of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs that the Government intends to continue to assist Aborigines to reach self-determination in their development and have opportunities for themselves and their <span class="highlight">children</span> which we would want to see them have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are told by  Mr Porter  that there has been a deterioration in the health and education provided to the <span class="highlight">children</span> and the people of Aurukun in general. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, the Committee found that at the time it conducted its study 70 per cent of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> admitted to hospital in Darwin suffered from malnutrition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seven per cent of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> admitted to hospital in the Northern Territory had severe malnutrition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that 18 per cent of Aborigines have visual defects and that 40 per cent of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> aged 6 years to 10 years have hearing defects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aspects of the report discuss the needs of families for assistance during the phases of family development through to the point at which <span class="highlight">children</span> leave home and the family comprises adult members only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The members of the Committee at the time of finalisation of the report were:  Mr Spencer  Colliver, First Assistant Director-General, Department of Social Security;  Mr Chris  Creswell, Attorney-General’s Department; Miss Lado Sybaczynskyj, Department of Health, and the Hospitals and Health Services Commission;  Mr Robert  Plummer, Director, Department of <span class="highlight">Children</span> ‘s Services, Queensland;  Mr Keith  Maine, Director. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, honourable senators may be aware that we have already established, through the <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services program which is administered by the Office of Child Care, a three-year pilot program to develop family support services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Messner  suggested,  inter alia,  that the use by <span class="highlight">children</span> of mouthguards in sport could be encouraged by allowing their cost as rebatable expenditure for income tax purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we need teachers who can see when <span class="highlight">children</span> are moving away from the norm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">children</span> who were not in trouble were also insecure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, many of the <span class="highlight">children</span> who were succeeding in school had the same problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Is the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications aware that the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts is currently conducting an inquiry into the impact of television on the learning and behaviour patterns of <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If not, will the Minister, firstly, take note of the fact that the Senate Committee is dealing with areas relating to those aspects of television and <span class="highlight">children</span> mentioned in that report; secondly, seek the interest and co-operation of his colleague’s Department to see whether arrangements can be satisfactorily made so that the Senate Committee’s report can be completed and tabled before the amendments to the Act are devised; and, thirdly, ascertain whether consultation can be arranged to ensure that any amendments to the Act are not in conflict with any recommendations of the Senate Committee? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Were I running a security risk industry such as a petro-chemical company where, if <span class="highlight">children</span> were allowed in with boxes of matches, I could see that my investment might go up in flames, I would be quite happy to go along with strict security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was taken to hospital and died there a few hours later, leaving behind him a widow and four <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought it was appropriate and proper at this juncture, before the Senate pursued its course any further this week, to say how sad and sorry I am- and I am sure that I have the support of all honourable senators who knew the late servant of the Senate- that he died so suddenly and left a widow and four <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He spent a great deal of his spare time helping <span class="highlight">children</span> in areas around Canberra to play football. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He umpired their games on Saturday mornings and started a sort of little league of school <span class="highlight">children</span> footballers in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because of his ability, kindness and very likeable personality and disposition, these <span class="highlight">children</span> stayed together as a team. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) What progress has been made in securing the agreement of State Governments to transfer or refer power to the Commonwealth to enable the Family Courts to make necessary orders with respect to <span class="highlight">children</span> who are not the legitimate <span class="highlight">children</span> of a marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When will action be effected to ensure that all <span class="highlight">children</span> can be treated with equal justice by the Courts and that other deficiencies arising in Family Law legislation through recent decisions of the High Court can be eliminated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) A reference of constitutional power to the Commonwealth to enable it to confer jurisdiction on the Family Courts over <span class="highlight">children</span> not covered by the Family Law Act necessarily depends entirely on the willingness of States to make such a reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Have they ever seen the misery experienced by mothers with half a dozen <span class="highlight">children</span>, <span class="highlight">children</span> separated from parents or women whose husbands are still in East Timor? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During a war involving a civilian population in tragic circumstances, a war which involved women and <span class="highlight">children</span>, there were no medical supplies and there was no capacity for hospitalisation or any form of international supervision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Bill corrects an anomaly in regard to the benefit entitlements of <span class="highlight">children</span> of those contributors who died in service before 1 July 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, <span class="highlight">children</span> of deceased contributors aged 21 to 25 years undergoing full time education will now be entitled to benefits in the same circumstances as the <span class="highlight">children</span> of pensioners who died prior to 1 July 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill ensures that the total benefits paid in respect of a spouse or spouses and <span class="highlight">children</span> of a contributor or pensioner who died before 1 July 1976 shall not exceed the pension that would have been payable to the member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One may wish to take the <span class="highlight">children</span> to town to see a movie because some of these areas do not have television but must make do with radio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that these other organisations which believe that mothers should be able to exercise a free and realistic choice as to whether they enter the work force or remain at home to raise <span class="highlight">children</span> are more representative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are two itinerant teachers who prepare school material for use of <span class="highlight">children</span> on the outstations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These itinerant teachers keep these <span class="highlight">children</span> abreast of what is happening within the Aurukun school, and the <span class="highlight">children</span> are treated as pupils of that school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it presents special problems for <span class="highlight">children</span> and I think the idea that peoples can go back to lands which can no longer be effectively hunted and lived on, and try and pretend that you’re living in some sort of- how shall I say it?- some son of hand-down from the old days, I think that this is a dream which may cost some people dearly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A school was built at south Weipa so that <span class="highlight">children</span> could be segregated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The drinking was brought by the white people and did make the people and <span class="highlight">children</span> suffer by drunkenness and broken homes, deserted homes, mothers left with <span class="highlight">children</span> and fathers left with <span class="highlight">children</span>, <span class="highlight">children</span> wandering away from the love of their father and mother which we know our homes before was the best Christian community now its brought heartaches and pains, car accidents, fights and deaths. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not that many years ago that the Government in its paternalistic way moved on to settlements and removed <span class="highlight">children</span> from their parents because it thought this was in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same stringent regulations did not apply to the removal of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of those parents as would apply to the removal of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of people who sit in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their wives and <span class="highlight">children</span> tended to live in capital cities but those men did not feel that they should be denied the pleasure of having a woman to live with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those <span class="highlight">children</span>, while very young, were sent to orphanages in the city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The health report in March 1973 of the situation at Aurukun- and this is interesting- revealed that 48 per cent of the <span class="highlight">children</span> were greatly under weight for their age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Checks made in May 1975 disclosed that less than half of those <span class="highlight">children</span> were showing even the standard weight increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to a report in the Melbourne  Sun  on 10 April of the weekend meeting between Commonwealth and State AttorneysGeneral and in particular to the statement that all State governments except those of Queensland and Western Australia are prepared to transfer family law powers to the Commonwealth to enable the same laws and facilities to apply to the custody and welfare of ex-nuptial <span class="highlight">children</span> and to all matrimonial property in order to overcome the effects of High Court judgments in 1976 which limited the effectiveness of the Family Law Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>First of all the Bill corrects in the Superannuation Act 1 922 an anomaly relating to benefit entitlements of <span class="highlight">children</span> of contributors who died in service before 1 July 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 6 of the Bill provides, for example, that <span class="highlight">children</span> of deceased contributors, where the <span class="highlight">children</span> are aged 21 to 25 and are undertaking full-time education, will now be entitled to benefits in the same circumstances as the <span class="highlight">children</span> of pensioners who died prior to 1 July 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ensures equity under the provisions of section 1 10 and also now provides for the further apportionment of benefits to surviving <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All persons within the community who are concerned about the teaching of basic skills to <span class="highlight">children</span> in schools will regard this inquiry into teacher education as vital in this and other respects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am aware that virtually over the lifetime of television in Australia parents have expressed concern at what they regard as both the poor quality and the paucity of <span class="highlight">children</span> ‘s programs in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My recollection is that the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts has, or had, as a reference, <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From an educational point of view I regard the provision of suitable <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs as a very important matter, although I must say that I feel personally that television, because it sees more than it hears, is not necessarily a good, rational educator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It arises from my concern that the influence of television on <span class="highlight">children</span> is so great that we have a duty to ensure that optimum standards prevail in respect of both <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs and television advertising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My understanding is that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, when it held its public hearings last year, had before it special evidence from a variety of individuals and organisations relating to <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television and broadcasting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am bound to say, without in any way denigrating the ability to upgrade the quality of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s broadcasting at the moment, that one of the great disabilities is that whilst we use the spectrum in the way we do, by using the ether to transmit the signals, there is a grave limitation on the number of channels and therefore a grave limitation upon the time available for <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that the Belconnen Family Day Care has a waiting list of more than 400 <span class="highlight">children</span>; if so, can the Minister assure the Belconnen Community Service that priority will be given by the Child Care Office to finding a solution to this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The role ofthe <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Services Sub-Committee of the Australian Capital Territory Consultative Committee on Social Welfare (ACTCCSW) is to advise the Office of Child Care on the operations of the <span class="highlight">Children</span> ‘s Services Program in the ACT. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In determining the membership of this SubCommittee I was conscious of the desirability of obtaining the broadest possible representation in the field of <span class="highlight">children</span> ‘s services in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The membership of this Sub-Committee allows an input into an extensive community network and includes representatives who have an understanding of the service requirements of high need families in the Australian Capital Territory including migrant families, families with handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> or parents, and single parent families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under present arrangements, applications for funding of <span class="highlight">children</span> ‘s services in the Australian Capital Territory arc referred to the Director of Social Security in Sydney for examination and recommendation to the Director-General of Social Services in Canberra; these arrangements are being reviewed with a view to providing for organisations in the Australian Capital Territory to apply directly to the DirectorGeneral in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Services Program, the majority of child care services are approved for ongoing funding and payments of grant moneys are made quarterly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are two family day care services conducted by that organisation; each has a capacity for 100 <span class="highlight">children</span> and recent advice from the organisation indicates that the child capacity of these services has not been reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Until such time as further evidence comes before the Government, purely in the educational field- certainly evidence that would indicate that what is happening is foreign to the standards of Australia and perhaps promotes violence- I think that we should look at the three schools as being schools that provide secular education for young <span class="highlight">children</span>, although we may not hold the views of this sect or its religion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said before- I do not want to repeat myself over and over again- there are hundreds of thousands of mothers in this country who are afraid of what might happen to their <span class="highlight">children</span> and to their <span class="highlight">children</span>’s <span class="highlight">children</span> if we do not have the necessary safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In correspondence to the States, the Commonwealth indicated that it wished to give greater emphasis in the future to the provision of child care for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of needy families and that it would be necessary to renegotiate the funding base in relation to pre-school funding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have detailed in chronological order how the pre-school funding commenced under a Labor Government in 1972 and how it has decreased somewhat rapidly until we have now reached the stage where we are having to rationalise preschools in South Australia and are having to cut down the hours those schools for the younger <span class="highlight">children</span> of our community are open. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am speaking mainly in respect of South Australia now, but the <span class="highlight">children</span> of every State in the Commonwealth ought to be given this initial start to life so that when they go to primary school they will be able to cope with the great problems that exist there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Withers in no way misled the Parliament; that it was not- if I can use the parlance of school <span class="highlight">children</span> again- a lie, at the best it was a white lie and why is that important? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These comments resulted from an examination which showed that about half of all adult Vietnamese arriving in Darwin had shown traces of tuberculosis and, in addition, 25 per cent of the <span class="highlight">children</span> had a positive skin reaction to tests which were carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite true that some of the Vietnamese <span class="highlight">children</span> show high positive reactions to skin tests and this could result later in a breakdown of the disease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This group includes large numbers of those who are isolated at home (especially women), elderly migrants (whose numbers are expected to increase dramatically in the course of the next decade), those from smaller ethnic groups (whose own support services are limited), migrant women at work and the <span class="highlight">children</span> of migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because migrants’ knowledge of the English language was found to be a critical factor in enabling successful settlement in Australia, special attention has been given to the teaching of English both to <span class="highlight">children</span> and to adults. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For <span class="highlight">children</span>, there is compelling evidence that there are many who need special instruction in English but who do not receive it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course it is reasonable for a man or woman, during the course of his or her working life to regard as one of the incentives for him or her to work the ability to accumulate some money to hand on to his or her <span class="highlight">children</span> knowing that if the <span class="highlight">children</span> fall upon adversity some time later on in life he or she will have left them some money to tide them over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that her view must be that if anything is left to <span class="highlight">children</span> or grandchildren it must be taxed as hard as it possibly can be because an Australian Labor Party government will not allow anyone to leave anything to anyone in a younger generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The one wish that the heads of the ordinary Australian family want is the chance to build a home; to get to own the home over a lifetime; to put some furniture and possessions together and to get a car- the Labor Party obviously does not want this- and then upon their death to be able to set up their <span class="highlight">children</span> with a few thousand dollars here and there to help them along and to be a little better off than they were. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Tehan  will know that there have been major advances in the overall funding of the isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>’s scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless, it is true that country <span class="highlight">children</span>, particularly those in remote areas, are gravely disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In my view, if the Government allowed families to average their income the nonsense about the creation of family partnerships, family trusts and family companies, which all are designed to spread income among husband, wife and <span class="highlight">children</span>, would no longer continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are operating a system of taxation under which the little man who runs a small business can earn $8,000 a year and, with perhaps three <span class="highlight">children</span> to educate, may receive an income tax demand of $3,600. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In other words, is it bad that hundreds of millions of dollars of aid has been given to the impoverished and drought stricken rural producers and isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>, and that there has been a lower take in taxation and a lower take in import duties? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For a year the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts has been inquiring into the question of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television programming in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever conclusions the Committee might draw, there is no doubt that there is widespread dissatisfaction with the quality of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television programming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one compares the quality of Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television with the quality of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television overseas the deficiency in the provision of good quality <span class="highlight">children</span> ‘s television programs in this country is seen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government wants a suggestion from the Opposition about how it might use the money, one suggestion would be that the Government could, by means of this son of legislation, offer some son of stimulus by way of an incentive such as a rebate or even a subsidy to commercial television stations and perhaps even to radio stations that do make a sincere and genuine contribution towards the production of better quality Australian programs, particularly better quality <span class="highlight">children</span> ‘s television programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the scheme is essentially one for dependent school <span class="highlight">children</span>, the level of benefits is designed as a contribution to parents supporting a student rather than as a living allowance on which a full-time student might support himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-59-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security and seeks clarification of the changes to the family allowance scheme whereby <span class="highlight">children</span>’s incomes are indexed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will <span class="highlight">children</span> such as those who now do not have to put in tax returns have to put in income statements or similar statements so that family allowances can be adjusted in their cases? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When introduced, the family allowance scheme took into account the tax rebates which were given for dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> in addition to the then child endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Finally, does the Government have some kind of hostility against <span class="highlight">children</span> who are attempting to supplement their pocket money by delivering newspapers, et cetera? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> with a separate net income above $312 a year will therefore receive a reduced benefit in respect of such <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is believed that there are many <span class="highlight">children</span> who have income from trusts and income from other sources who could not be classed as dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can say only that I am sure that the effect of the Budget in its entirety and the effect of the almost $ 1,000m that will be paid in family allowances next year will show that this Government has been very responsive to the needs of Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> and the strengthening of the Australian family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In practical terms, this means that it is impossible for an immigrant from Yugoslavia or his <span class="highlight">children</span> to renounce their Yugoslav citizenship despite the fact that they become Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Marko Nazor, 3 1 , of Downer, who returned to his family in Australia this month after three years in a Yugoslav jail, said yesterday that he had been subjected to psychological torture and threatened with the death of his wife and three <span class="highlight">children</span> while a political prisoner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are also concerned that this very fact gives the Yugoslav Consular authorities in Australia power to haunt its dissidents beyond their terrestrial life, since this claim of citizenship extends beyond them to their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These people act as interpreters, both in the legal situation and in the normal social situation, such as getting <span class="highlight">children</span> into school, arranging contacts with employers and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say again, as I said last week, that, in taking this decision, the Government had in mind circumstances where, as a result of trusts and other income-splitting devices, <span class="highlight">children</span> receive separate income whilst their parents continue to receive the family allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is concerned to ensure that the decision does not have unintended consequences, particularly in cases where <span class="highlight">children</span> receive small amounts of income as a result of part-time jobs which they undertake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of the comments and the concern which has been expressed the Government is reviewing this decision with a view to eliminating any unintended consequences whilst preserving the principal purpose behind the decision, that is with respect to those cases where <span class="highlight">children</span> are in receipt of trust income and other income-splitting device income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier today and last week, some <span class="highlight">children</span> are in receipt of a trust income, and income-splitting devices are used within families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these devices arc used the Government believes that family allowances should not be paid and that a means test should be applied to such an income received by <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other areas such as the maintenance which is received from the father of the <span class="highlight">children</span> and paid to a former wife, incomes from scholarships and Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowances, need clarification since the announcement of the Budget decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the draft legislation is completed I hope to be able to make a specific announcement so that there is no uncertainty about the means test which will be applied to incomes in the hands of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Was it intended by the Government, when it introduced the Budget, that family allowances would be income tested on the basis of income derived from the personal exertions of <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will the Minister now give an unqualified assurance to the people of Australia that family allowances will not be income tested on the basis of income derived from the personal exertions of <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I  am able to answer  Senator Harradine  by saying that it is intended that personal exertion income achieved by <span class="highlight">children</span> will not be subjected to the means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intention of the legislation is that income from the personal exertions of <span class="highlight">children</span> will not be subjected to the means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister say now what procedure the Government proposes to take to ascertain the incomes that <span class="highlight">children</span> receive from trust accounts and /or partnerships? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I adverted to the fact that when the family allowance scheme was set up the original tax rebates for dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> were used as part of the source from which funds were able to be drawn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The next part of  Senator Gietzelt  ‘s question related to the procedure which the Department of Social Security will need to use to obtain from the parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> details of the incomes received by the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that an informed Australia would perhaps even be persuaded to tax itself more heavily if it were convinced that extra money would be a genuine investment in its own future and its <span class="highlight">children</span>’s future and if that decision were its own decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As one with three <span class="highlight">children</span> I suggest that we cannot allow young people to go straight out of school and to be frustrated to the extent they are being frustrated now and to allow them to go to employer after employer and be told: ‘We have nothing for you’ and then say: ‘We will not let you actually starve; we will give you a small amount of money, just enough to live on, but for God’s sake do not ever go near a beach or the bush because if you do you will be called a dole bludger’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully say that we are concerned about the discrimination which exists against the <span class="highlight">children</span> of those parents who are in receipt of the Supporting Parents Benefit in comparison with <span class="highlight">children</span> of Single Parents who receive the Widows Pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question which I direct to the Minister representing the Minister for Health refers to <span class="highlight">children</span> who suffer from brain damage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For many years the program was available only to those Australians who could afford to take their <span class="highlight">children</span> to the United States of America or to Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of those factors, I ask the Minister: As the United Nations prepares to focus the world’s attention on the rights of <span class="highlight">children</span> with the International Year of the Child, what is Australia doing to ensure that its brain damaged <span class="highlight">children</span> are given every opportunity to full recovery? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the International Year of the Child and the focus on handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> and their treatment are concerned, I am able to say that, under our handicapped persons’ assistance program and under our Office of Child Care program, some projects are able to be funded in this year which will have special significance as a celebration of the International Year of the Child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the general question about focussing the world’s attention on handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> in the International Year of the Child is concerned, I will certainly do what I am able to do to see that this is brought into focus but that it goes further and that there are projects which have support from State and Federal government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-When did the Minister for Social Security first realise that the tax to be imposed on a child’s income in excess of $312, which was announced in the Budget last week, would affect families other than those whose <span class="highlight">children</span>’s incomes are derived from family trusts, partnerships, et cetera? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point about this is that the Government has said already that the means test in respect of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s income for family allowance purposes will not apply to <span class="highlight">children</span> ‘s income by virtue of the moneys that they earn from newspaper selling and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will remember the glossy white folder we received last year called ‘Australian uranium policy’, or something like that, which was distributed to members of parliament, school <span class="highlight">children</span> and Godknowswho else in Australia to explain to them that the Government was very concerned about the development of uranium mining and the sale of uranium to overseas countries and that it would insist on the highest possible standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But I point out to the Senate that this legislation was introduced into the House of Representatives before the announcement by the Government of its review of the family allowance arrangements and its statement that to test eligibility for family allowances on the basis of income derived from the personal exertion of <span class="highlight">children</span> would be an unintended consequence of the Budget proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we then divide the $120 into the $37m saving for this particular section of the new scheme we find that a minimum of 300,000 <span class="highlight">children</span> would have been affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Either my calculations are incorrect; the scheme was always envisaged to cover more than just those involved in the trusts angle- and so the statement that the test would also apply to income derived from the personal exertion of <span class="highlight">children</span> was not factual; or that the Government has no clear idea at all of what savings on Budget outlays will result from that scheme however it is amended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The European Ministers hope that this event will stimulate a better understanding of the positions of the child in the social and family context in every country of the world, taking into account the conditions, needs and priorities of each country, and that it will make it possible to develop measures designed to foster the physical, mental and social well-being of all <span class="highlight">children</span>, and in particular those of the third world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand, stresses within the family due, for instance, to the change from hierarchical family relationships to relationships based on equality of spouses and a greater autonomy of <span class="highlight">children</span>, or problems in relations between parents and educational institution, or specific educational problems, such as sex education, may be found in all countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the fact that the Government, through public pressure, has been able to reverse some other decisions made in the Budget-  Senator Guilfoyle  who is in charge of the Senate tonight as recently as Tuesday told us that she would introduce amending legislation to the Budget in respect of the decision to stop the payment of family allowances in cases where <span class="highlight">children</span> earned income- I hope that the Government in its wisdom will do the same in this case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This policy also is characterised by ad hockery, the pursuit of narrow sectional interests- a traditional avenue of Liberal Party governments- and, more specifically, by the total absence of a foresighted commitment to Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>, something which has characterised all Federal Liberal Party government education policies for many years, in favour of the piecemeal pursuit of a narrow ideology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our position and the position of the Government between 1973 and 1975 was quite clear on that issue, namely, that irrespective of whether <span class="highlight">children</span> were being educated in private schools or in government schools every child in this country was entitled to the maximum assistance which a government could give based on the needs of that child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time we put an end to the attitudes which were very prevalent in this country- in a sense they still are, particularly amongst government members- in which education is seen as a means of advancing one’s own child as against other <span class="highlight">children</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last two sets of guidelines there has been very great concern for the interests of the wealthy private schools as distinct from the interests of the poorer independent or non-government schools and as distinct from the interests of <span class="highlight">children</span> in government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, the two States which are not up to target are New South Wales and Queensland, which have almost exactly half the school <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australia in their schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This comes from a government which we were promised in the 1977 GovernorGeneral’s Speech would be a government for all people in Australia, a government which one would hope at least would be a government for all <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia, and not a government which is dedicated to providing unequal resources for Australian school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Minister should have his attention drawn to a survey made last year by the New South Wales Department of Education which showed, for example, that some 9,225 <span class="highlight">children</span> in New South Wales schools who responded to a survey in the last year of their school education said: ‘Yes, I would have liked to have left school last year but I could not leave school because I could not get a job’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As many as 9,225 school <span class="highlight">children</span> in New South Wales in years 9, 10 and 11 in their schooling made that statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of that number 884 school <span class="highlight">children</span> were in the Liverpool area, alone, which is situated in the big Federal electorate of Werriwa, as I recall it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As many as 1 ,034 <span class="highlight">children</span> were in the metropolitan west area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The cost of putting those <span class="highlight">children</span>, who represent hidden factors in the unemployment figures of this country, on the dole would have been about $20m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important, as a current issue in education, to consider what the education system is in fact doing for those <span class="highlight">children</span>, rather than to consider it as some glorified form of keeping the deficit as low as possible, of keeping down the unemployment figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sincerely hope that the Government in any later initiatives that it may take- if it is capable of taking initiatives- will try not to turn the clock back and reach a solution to these problems by reverting to the simplistic ideologies of the 1960s; that it will see the issue as it is now, because the issue of unemployment, for example, which I raised, and of hidden unemployment in schools, concerns all <span class="highlight">children</span>, whether they be in government schools or in non-government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Budget contained originally an extraordinary proposal to means test <span class="highlight">children</span>’s pocket money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The low income families so dependent on them have suffered a loss in real income and those pensioners with <span class="highlight">children</span> and pensioners with rented accommodation who have not had their <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowances or rent allowances increased since 1975 are now well below the poverty line, as pointed out by Professor Henderson who conducted the poverty inquiry and by almost every welfare agency in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It showed that families with <span class="highlight">children</span> which had one bread winner earning an income on or below average weekly earnings were up to $ 1 1 a week worse off as a result of the present Government’s tax policies and family allowance changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, the Government originally intended to income tax test the pocket money of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are those other handicapped people who will also feel the clutches of the tax man unless the Government, as it has done in the case of the <span class="highlight">children</span> and in the case of the blind, again feels some sense of conscience for what it has done and changes its mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has told us that it was not intended that the income earned by <span class="highlight">children</span> in their own right should be taxed and that she will introduce regulations to change the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a totally unexpected attackonthemostseverelydisadvantaged people in our community through the decision to cut back the indexation of age pensions from a six-month to a 12-month frequency; by imposing new tax burdens on other recipients of social security pensions; by taxing family allowances through the mechanism of taxing <span class="highlight">children</span>’s incomes; by abolishing the maternity allowance, which was a very minor form of assistance to families; by imposing a totally inequitable form of increased taxation through indirect taxes which, of course, fall more heavily on the poor than on the rich; and by failing entirely to raise new and proper sources of revenue from the very rich and fruitful enterprises which are carried out in the minerals and energy sector of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, the report of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Specific Learning Difficulties in <span class="highlight">Children</span> and Adults has received very close attention by my Department and other agencies in the portfolio, such as the Education Research and Development Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, later it was reported that women from the shelter had said that the allegations were exaggerated, that there was no improper conduct and that in fact <span class="highlight">children</span> in the shelter were not at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer, firstly, to a matter that I raised in a question to the Minister for Social Security,  Senator Guilfoyle,  on 23 August 1978 concerning brain injuries to <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister gave me what I felt was a responsible answer at the time, but I mention it again today because I am pressing for the Government to take more positive action in this matter of brain injured <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some weeks ago while visiting Melbourne on another matter I was brought into contact with the Australian Centre for Brain Injured <span class="highlight">Children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Never in my whole life have I been as affected as I was by seeing the scheme for the treatment of brain injured <span class="highlight">children</span> which is administered by the Australian Centre for Brain Injured <span class="highlight">Children</span> in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present there is no way that families of brain injured <span class="highlight">children</span> can get any assistance from the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I intended to give the Senate a definition of <span class="highlight">children</span> who come under this category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The definition includes <span class="highlight">children</span> diagnosed as having cerebral palsy or Downs syndrome, spastic <span class="highlight">children</span>, mentally retarded <span class="highlight">children</span>, autistic <span class="highlight">children</span> and so on, and any child who is now functioning below peer level as a result of brain injury, ranging from a severely hurt child to one with learning problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Centre for Brain Injured <span class="highlight">Children</span> recognises this fact and tries to encourage it wherever possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Previously parents of <span class="highlight">children</span> such as the child to whom I have referred had to take their <span class="highlight">children</span> to America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That expenditure is just not possible for most of the families who have <span class="highlight">children</span> who need this kind of attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Government have a look at this matter and under the health scheme or in some other way provide financial assistance for families with <span class="highlight">children</span> who suffer these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the <span class="highlight">children</span> who have undertaken this scheme have gone right through the education system and have graduated from university with qualifications higher than people who had never suffered brain injury at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Security to look more closely at the matter that I raised in relation to brain damaged <span class="highlight">children</span> and to make some investigations of the Australian Centre for Brain Injured <span class="highlight">Children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps we can do something to assist financially the families of <span class="highlight">children</span> who have brain damage and who are seeking treatment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the Government at least to make some investigations and inquiries and then to devise some means whereby the Australian Centre for Brain Injured <span class="highlight">Children</span> can receive some assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Will the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs inform the Senate as to the truth in reports that because of cuts to Aboriginal welfare programs it has been necessary for a charitable organisation to agree to fund a comprehensive nutritional program for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> in New South Wales? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That provision was put in by  Mr Fraser  and those other Government members whose perceptions of reality, when considering the question of whether dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> should have incomes, were . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would not occur to a person like the Prime Minister that there are <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia who earn pocket money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their perception of reality and the incomes of dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> is of course related to <span class="highlight">children</span> who receive income from family trusts set up for the purpose of evading taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But instead of doing the logical thing and tightening up on the tax laws on family trusts which have enabled people such as the Minister for Industry and Commerce  (Mr Lynch),  the Prime Minister, the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  and no doubt virtually all the senior Ministers of this Government to evade taxation, they thought it would be a better idea to phase out family allowances for dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> who have incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we think that we are concerned only with the aged people and the effect that these amendments will have on them, I think we should pay some attention to the effect they will have on the <span class="highlight">children</span> of these aged people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">children</span> are not always in a position to help the aged people in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many areas, including homeless women and <span class="highlight">children</span>, and girls in need of protection, could well come under such a program but have not done so in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is almost inevitable that at some time during the life of such a family one of the <span class="highlight">children</span> will reach the stage of becoming homeless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The problem embraces young people, people with acute psychological problems, and many more of the people now concerned than previously are women and <span class="highlight">children</span> and many are Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Education and I refer to the Senate standing committee report on isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister give further information in response to recent representations in relation to this report and also in relation to recent statements in South Australia that assistance to isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> will be reduced? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will this be extended to further groups of people, such as migrants and Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that over the past three years the Government has extended very greatly its aid to isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some 20,000 <span class="highlight">children</span> will be assisted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As promised in the 1977 policy speech, an additional $ 100 per child is payable in 1978 to families living in tax zones A and B whose <span class="highlight">children</span> are eligible for the basic boarding allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Northern Territory we pay a supplementary allowance of up to $150 a year for <span class="highlight">children</span> eligible for the basic boarding allowance, and a supplement of $50 a year for Territory <span class="highlight">children</span> who qualify for the basic correspondence allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister now give an unqualified assurance to the people of Australia that family allowances will not be income tested on the basis of income derived from the personal exertions of <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am able to answer  Senator Harradine  by saying that it is intended that personal exertion income achieved by <span class="highlight">children</span> will not be subjected to the means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that just prior to lunch the Minister held a Press conference at which she indicated that subject to an increased threshold, income derived from the personal exertion of <span class="highlight">children</span> will be subject to a means test? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall that in August we discussed the income testing of family allowances on the basis of income in the hands of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following our party meeting today, at the Press conference which is held subsequent to each party meeting I advised the Press that last night the Cabinet had made a decision that family allowances would be means tested on the basis of income received by <span class="highlight">children</span> at a threshold of income in excess of $1040 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The income that will be exempt from family allowance testing will be maintenance payments received on behalf of <span class="highlight">children</span>, scholarship income including Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowances, superannuation compensation, pension income, and trust income derived from deceased parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the exclusions that I have mentioned, income in the hands of <span class="highlight">children</span> will be included. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that when the family allowance scheme was introduced, two factors were put together- the old child endowment scheme and the taxable rebate scheme for dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has taken into account the fact that there was an abatement of that rebate for dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> when a child had income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are payments for income tax, superannuation contributions, rent or mortgage payments for a dwelling in which the applicant resides, half of any board paid by the applicant, municipal rates and water rates for a dwelling in which the applicant resides, maintenance payments to a spouse and any <span class="highlight">children</span> of the applicant, payments under hire purchase agreements for household goods and furniture used by the applicant in the home and payments for health insurance to a maximum of $150 per annum for a single person or $300 for a married person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Family allowances, orphans pensions, handicapped child’s allowance and additional pensions or benefits for a child will generally no longer be payable in respect of <span class="highlight">children</span> who are classed as living abroad on a permanent basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister say whether this will apply in any way to the <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australian Government employees serving on long term overseas postings of two, three or more years and to the <span class="highlight">children</span> of other Australians on long term postings overseas, such as business people, as these postings sometimes, I understand, require residence visas for the countries of posting? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should explain that the general purpose behind the proposal is to prevent the payment of family allowances, the double orphans pension or the handicapped child’s allowance and the additional pension or benefit that is paid on behalf of <span class="highlight">children</span> who are unlikely to come to Australia, regardless of whether they have been here before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement I just made in response to a question from  Senator Harradine  outlined the detail of the Cabinet decision which was made last night with regard to the family allowance income test on income held in the hands of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be recalled that much discussion was held with regard to the income level of <span class="highlight">children</span> who have small part-time jobs which would earn them something in the region of $6 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Do honourable senators remember that the Labor Government brought about the cessation of the provision of free milk to school <span class="highlight">children</span>, the cancellation of airmail subsidies in isolated areas, the wholesale closure of country post offices and the elimination of the 20 per cent differential for rural electorates? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let it be clearly recorded, firmly asserted and proudly boasted that it was the Liberals of their day who curbed the power of the Crown, who extended the suffrage, who freed the Press, who took the <span class="highlight">children</span> out of the mines and who, above all, ended the trade in human slaves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How many more deaths, how many more unloved <span class="highlight">children</span> need there be before we wake up? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One does not have to be an Einstein or a Rhodes scholar to know that with Christmas approaching a further 225,000 <span class="highlight">children</span> will finish school without jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not an exaggerated figure because <span class="highlight">children</span> who should have left school two years ago or last year went back to school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that to establish models or prognoses for the future any form of forecasting is rather difficult, but I would have thought that anyone would not need to be a genius to be able to predict roughly the number of teachers that would be needed for a certain number of <span class="highlight">children</span> three years ahead, birth rates and attrition rates being known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet we still have illiteracy and innumeracy with something like 25 per cent of <span class="highlight">children</span> of 14 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It covered women’s refuges, child care centresone could go on- and involved people in the community in looking after young <span class="highlight">children</span>, with the Government topping up only one- fifth of the cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In my view, the greatest crime we can commit, as senators, as members of parliament- no, as ordinary human beings- is, when we die, through acts of omission or commission to leave this world this country, the city in which we live, a poorer, less happy or less safe place for our <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are saying is that unless we look in a global sense at satellites, at Concorde, at uranium, at whatever new inventions the technologists give us, we will have perpetrated the greatest crime on our <span class="highlight">children</span> by leaving this an unhappy place, a less safe place, for them- or perhaps leave no place at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In regard to unemployment of the young, 16 per cent of our <span class="highlight">children</span> aged between 15 and 19 years are now unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are betraying our <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is not a responsible parent in the country who did not go to his <span class="highlight">children</span> when they were young and say: ‘Do not leave school early. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have no objection to married women working but believe that our policies should not actively encourage married women, especially if they have young <span class="highlight">children</span>, to work at low wage rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is bad enough for its effect on the unemployment problem, but is terrible for the <span class="highlight">children</span> and must be creating psychological problems that, in due course, we will have to pay for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether in a free society we can say to a man 40 years of age with <span class="highlight">children</span> of, say, 10 years and 14 years attending the local school, a man active in community affairs: ‘ You are going to be uprooted and sent to another State’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That as citizens of New South Wales and parents of State school <span class="highlight">children</span>, we are most concerned that the quality of education available in our schools be of the highest possible standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time we were talking of the Cabinet decision, as announced in the Budget, that income over $312 per annum received by <span class="highlight">children</span> would be subjected to means testing for family allowance purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present we have no record of the income of <span class="highlight">children</span> or of families because of the universal nature of the family allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am unable to give any indication as to how many families or <span class="highlight">children</span> would be affected by the decision because, as I say, we have no knowledge of their income, but I am advised by the Treasury that on the basis of its knowledge of the income of <span class="highlight">children</span>, from income tax returns, it estimates the savings which I reported yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, will the family allowance be withheld, or partly withheld, from mothers of those <span class="highlight">children</span> who between June 1977 and June 1978 earned and spent income of more than $20 a week, unaware that a mother would be penalised for the whole of the next year because of what had been earned in the previous year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister clarify whether the taxation will apply to the allowances that are attached to the awards and, specifically, the allowances for a dependent spouse or dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I seek information regarding the declaration now required to be made by mothers on their <span class="highlight">children</span>’s income earned in the 1977-78 income year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What documentation of this income will be required by the Government, bearing in mind that payments for <span class="highlight">children</span>’s odd jobs, such as baby sitting, is typically by cash and without receipt? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to <span class="highlight">children</span>, both girls and boys, of the tender ages of 10, 11 or 12 years, who have run away from home because of the continual arguments and the tragedies that tend to occur when the breadwinner is in fear of losing his livelihood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall start by pointing out that the family allowance was introduced in August 1976 as a replacement for the child endowment scheme and the tax rebates which were available in respect of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The child endowment and tax rebate schemes which previously existed were both a recognition of the fact that to rear a child costs money and that families with <span class="highlight">children</span>, whether they are rich or poor families, had expenses associated with child rearing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were payments in recognition of the fact that it costs money to rear <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some families, particularly those on benefits or on minimum wages, the <span class="highlight">children</span> earn their own pocket money, sometimes to the extent of $20 or $30 a week, and sometimes even $40 a week, by delivering newspapers, selling newspapers, working in shops and in part time jobs in factories, and doing various other jobs in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is frequently the only way they can raise money for further study, for musical instruments, for field trips at school, for extra clothes, and for the extra things other <span class="highlight">children</span> have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span> of rich families do not need to work but they frequently do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A widow who has two or three <span class="highlight">children</span> and who is receiving the widow’s pension is at present, as Professor Henderson has pointed out many times, some $20 below the poverty Une in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one of her <span class="highlight">children</span> earned $30 a week by working weekends in a supermarket, which many <span class="highlight">children</span> do- I know <span class="highlight">children</span> who do this- she would in fact lose her family allowance for that child, she would be forced further below the poverty line than she was before and the child’s efforts to assist his mother to achieve a more reasonable level of income would be defeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, a mother of three <span class="highlight">children</span> who has one child who becomes ineligible for the family allowance will lose not only the $3.50 a week in respect of that child but also $2.50 a week in respect of the next two <span class="highlight">children</span>, who will become respectively the first and second <span class="highlight">children</span> instead of the second and third <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite wrong to deprive single parents, widows or any other low income people in the community of a family allowance on the basis of what their <span class="highlight">children</span> earn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To deprive a family of the family allowance on the basis of what the <span class="highlight">children</span> earn in an effort to assist that family’s income is quite wrong and may well put it back into a situation of dependency on the Government which it does not want and in which it need not be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that the Government could even be said to be discouraging <span class="highlight">children</span> from earning money and gaining early work force experience, which is something they may well need in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said this morning that initially some 400 staff are expected to be put on to process the income statements received from these <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some two million people in this community will have to be contacted on behalf of some  4V*  million <span class="highlight">children</span> and they will have to answer questionnaires on how much those <span class="highlight">children</span> earned from all sorts of sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What will happen to the people who do not get their returns in, the people who have difficulties with the bureaucracy already, the people whose <span class="highlight">children</span> earned over $30 a week in 1977-78 and then earn nothing in 1 979? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the parents of these <span class="highlight">children</span> really be deprived of their family allowances in 1979 on the basis of something their <span class="highlight">children</span> earned in 1977 and 1978? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tax deductions for dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> were taken away from the breadwinner- traditionally the manand an approximately equivalent sum of money was transferred in an accounting process so that the mothers of Australia received an income which related to the fact that they were mothers looking after <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has rightly decided that it will try to do away with a tax dodge, a system of spreading family income across all members of a family, including dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>, so that the tax that would otherwise be payable on the income, in most cases of the father, cannot be reduced by an artificial spreading of his income across his <span class="highlight">children</span> and possibly also his wife. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, we welcome more and more people coming into the Parliament who are migrants or who are the <span class="highlight">children</span> of people who have migrated to this country within its recent history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could avail ourselves of those histories far more directly in our schools, learn about them and let the <span class="highlight">children</span> who come from those cultural backgrounds understand that we are interested in them- that they have a right to be proud of the fact that they have their own individual history and culture that they bring to this country to share with us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a pity that the <span class="highlight">children</span> of our migrants go into our schools and use and learn about only English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be an enriching experience for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australian parents to understand those other <span class="highlight">children</span> who share classrooms with them, who have another language and a history about which those <span class="highlight">children</span> have as much right to feel proud as the <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australian parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These matters do not have to dominate us, but they are something from which our <span class="highlight">children</span> should benefit from learning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much, or nearly all, of the discussion on multicultural education has turned on the subject of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of migrants and of migrants themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we lose the opportunity of teaching all our <span class="highlight">children</span>- those <span class="highlight">children</span> born in Australia and those <span class="highlight">children</span> born in lands over the sea- just how interesting and valuable that culture is it will be a tragedy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly in Aboriginal schools the <span class="highlight">children</span> should learn of their own culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But they will be really proud when we recognise that it is a culture of great value- of enduring value- for its own sake and that it is a culture about which we want to teach our <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion on this issue, I make the point that when we recognise, as we should, the enormous contribution that our migrants and the <span class="highlight">children</span> of our migrants have made to our country by paying the attention we should pay to their culture and by recognising the fact that their culture is now part of ours we should recognise also that the original Australians had a culture about which we need to know, one which can most effectively be brought into our society and a knowledge of which should be spread throughout our schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard today that the assurance that income earned by <span class="highlight">children</span> through personal exertion would not affect eligibility to receive the family allowance would have applied only if the income ceiling had remained at $3 12 per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is believed that there are many <span class="highlight">children</span> who have income from trusts and income from other sources who could not be classed as dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the introduction of a means test on family allowances aimed principally at wealthy <span class="highlight">children</span> who receive an unearned income through inherited property or through devices such as income splitting by trusts? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it possible to means test these people without discouraging enterprising <span class="highlight">children</span>, many of whom are from low income families? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government introduced the means test on <span class="highlight">children</span>’s income after reflecting on the fact that the family allowance scheme replaced the tax rebate which had previously been given to parents for a dependent child - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say again, as I said last week, that, in taking this decision, the Government had in mind circumstances where, as a result of trusts and other income splitting devices, <span class="highlight">children</span> receive separate income whilst their parents continue to receive the family allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is concerned to ensure that the decision does not have unintended consequences, particularly in cases where <span class="highlight">children</span> receive small amounts of income as a result of pan-time jobs which they undertake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of the comments and the concern which has been expressed the Government is reviewing this decision with a view to eliminating any unintended consequences whilst preserving the principal purpose behind the decision, that is with respect to those cases where <span class="highlight">children</span> are in receipt of trust income and other income-splitting device income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier today and last week, some <span class="highlight">children</span> are in receipt of a trust income, and income-splitting devices are used within families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and that a means test should be applied to such an income received by <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will the Minister now give an unqualified assurance to the people of Australia that family allowances will not be income tested on the basis of income derived from the personal exertions of <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am able to answer  Senator Harradine  by saying that it is intended that personal exertion income achieved by <span class="highlight">children</span> will not be subjected to the means test . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intention of the legislation is that income from the personal exertions of <span class="highlight">children</span> will not be subjected to the means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of her answers to questions asked earlier this week, can the Minister give an estimate of the number of mothers who will not receive the family allowance next year because of their <span class="highlight">children</span>’s separate incomes from family trusts and partnership arrangements? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What percentage of <span class="highlight">children</span> having an income would this represent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not able to give any figures on the means testing of the separate income of <span class="highlight">children</span> from family trusts or from income splitting devices that may have been established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only a simple change was necessary to make family allowances liable to a means test if a child or <span class="highlight">children</span> received UNEARNED income above a certain level, as would be the case with a trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to speak on the matter that was raised during Question Time concerning the taxing- that  is  the only word I can use, although it is not quite accurate- of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s earnings from personal exertion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time it was considered by various speakers that any attempt by the Government to place a test on income earned by <span class="highlight">children</span> through personal exertion was mean, pennypinching and immoral in the true sense of the term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Personal exertion on the part of <span class="highlight">children</span> in order to support their families in difficult circumstances is in some way to limit the family allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">children</span> participate in some activity to support the family income and $20 a week is really only a small amount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is what <span class="highlight">children</span> could earn quite easily on a Saturday morning by delivering newspapers or magazines, or doing a variety of jobs or messages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has shown extreme disloyalty to one of his Ministers who gave a clear assurance to the Senate that the policy of the Government was not to persist with the proposal to take into account when calculating the family allowance the earnings of <span class="highlight">children</span> derived from their personal exertion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What will the Government do to <span class="highlight">children</span> under this legislation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about money which the <span class="highlight">children</span> physically earn themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be abhorrent to everyone in this place that the Government should attempt in some way to limit those earnings and to take some of them away from the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the <span class="highlight">children</span> who are earning a few dollars are concerned, this proposal means that some of their earnings will be taken away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Minister has given a clear assurance to the Senate that the policy of the Government is that if it is clear that the income of <span class="highlight">children</span> is earned by personal exertion it will not be taxed and it will not in any way affect the family allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly the thrust of  Senator Guilfoyle  ‘s remarks in the days following the Budget in August were along the lines that the Government had no intention of catching in its net the wages and earnings of newsboys or <span class="highlight">children</span> in that situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following publication of the family services report, has the Federal Government, as the largest single employer in the nation, been able to increase opportunity of employment by the use of flexible working hours to enable parents, particularly lone parents, to combine as a choice work and caring for their <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do I understand the position to be, as I gathered from  Senator Guilfoyle  ‘s reply, that any earnings of school <span class="highlight">children</span> will not be taken into account in respect of family allowances? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it further the case that one of the major drains on funds has proved to be the separate representation of <span class="highlight">children</span> in Family Court proceedings, as directed by judges of that court in the exercise of their powers under the Family Law Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Far from being the thriving growth centre, far from being the developing and flourishing national capital which it had been, it has now become a seriously depressed place, a place where for the youth and the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the community there is very little hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was hoped that the Australian Capital Territory would be able to develop more options in regard to the education of <span class="highlight">children</span> from all backgrounds and that it would be able to introduce educational innovations in areas such as assessments, the kind of education offered to senior secondary students, alternatives to traditional academic education and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another element which is of significance in the provision of educational services in the Australian Capital Territory is the high proportion of <span class="highlight">children</span> in our schools who were not born in Australia or whose parents were not born in Australia and do not speak English in the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the factors which makes it very desirable that there be a particularly flexible and community-responsive education system, but again the ideals of providing multi-cultural education for <span class="highlight">children</span> from different ethnic backgrounds in the Australian Capital Territory has foundered because of the staff ceilings policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a locally elected representative of the Australian Capital Territory, I am contacted daily by parents and citizens organisations which are expressing their concern about the disorganisation, the decline in standards and the failure of the Government to respond to the real education needs of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More importantly, from my point of view, we have a critical situation in terms of the future of the hundreds of thousands of families who live and work in the Territory, whose <span class="highlight">children</span> have been borne here and who would have hoped a few years ago to have their futures here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is no longer going to put a ceiling on the family allowance as regards the taxation of <span class="highlight">children</span> who pick up a bit of pin money by working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I have stated publicly, and I repeat, that I regret very much that teachers in the Australian Capital Territory should see fit to deny their services- this for the second time in the space of a week or so- to <span class="highlight">children</span> and to use <span class="highlight">children</span> as pawns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen the Minister very much on the defensive as she has been asked questions as to why there has been a change in the Government’s attitude in respect of taxing <span class="highlight">children</span>’s income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government failed to take that action but it set out to introduce into this Budget for the first time the imposition of taxes on disadvantaged sections of the Australian community, whether they be <span class="highlight">children</span>, those working in sheltered workshops, or disabled people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This last week of this three-week sitting has been the period in which the Government has recognised that to undermine an allowance such as the family allowance, even by the suggestion of means testing a mother’s family allowance by taking into account the income derived from the personal exertion of <span class="highlight">children</span>, is an attack on a fundamental institution which, rather than being undermined, needs support to overcome the very problem with which this country is faced- the unemployment problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even under the old scheme which was inadequate and when the child endowment had not been indexed, a family with six <span class="highlight">children</span> would have been $7.43 a week better off than under the new family allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of this to-ing and fro-ing of tactics with regard to the income testing of family allowances because of the personal exertion of <span class="highlight">children</span>, I believe, was a smokescreen to cover up the fact that a family with five <span class="highlight">children</span> is now $8.55 a week worse off because of the erosion of the family allowance as a result of price increases since 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The problem of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> is one with which the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts has had a great deal of association because of its inquiry into the education of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An amount of $ 14.6m has been provided this year for education assistance for isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>, which is an increase of $10.5m over the 1977-78 figure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Additional amounts have been provided for the Northern Territory and, as promised in the 1977 policy speech of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  an additional $ 100 per child is payable under the isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>’s program to families living in certain tax zones whose <span class="highlight">children</span> are eligible for basic boarding allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the situation of a man with a wife and two <span class="highlight">children</span> and give figures for the past five years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1974, a man with a wife and two <span class="highlight">children</span> received under Commonwealth post-graduate awards some $3,986; in 1975, some $4,394; in 1976, some $4,758; and in 1977-the first impact of the Fraser Government- some $6,288. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Minister gave figures about post-graduate awards this morning he used the example of a married person with a dependent spouse and two <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think this case is as unwise as was the proposed tax on <span class="highlight">children</span>’s income, or the intention to tax invalid pensioners but it is one that, in good conscience, I must try to correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Would it be unfair to ask the Minister for Administrative Services  (Senator Chaney)  to tell the Senate at a later stage whether, for example, donations to the United Nations <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Fund are tax deductible for the purposes of the Act and, if not, why the Government’s priorities are directed towards wildlife rather than <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite proper for  Senator Button  to query the priorities given to <span class="highlight">children</span> and wildlife. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Button  will be pleased to know, as I am, that under section 78 one of the bodies which has this benefit is the United Nations Appeal for <span class="highlight">Children</span>, so there is another example of the bodies which are selected for tax deductible status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister’s attention also been drawn to the comment from the Queensland Education Department that Federal members of Parliament, including Cabinet Ministers, had no right to go around handing out holidays to Queensland school <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do any provisions exist which allow for relief in cases of hardship arising amongst families which rely on the mails for educating outback <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not aware of any specific measures that are available to provide assistance to those families which are particularly reliant on the mails for providing education for their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These funds are distributed so as to reflect the needs of <span class="highlight">children</span> of non-English speaking background in different areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These allocations mean there will be increases of $399,000 in the disadvantaged country areas program and $75,000 in the <span class="highlight">children</span> in institutions program in 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The education of country <span class="highlight">children</span> requires a considerable mobilisation of effort in Australia, a mobilisation in which local communities should play a significant part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of the Bill cover the following: Indexation of pensions and benefits; age pensions for persons aged 70 or more; rationalisation of payments for <span class="highlight">children</span>; family allowances, including handicapped child’s allowance and double orphan’s pension; maternity allowance; and payments of benefits in respect of <span class="highlight">children</span> living abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additional payments- that is, additional pension for <span class="highlight">children</span>, guardian’s allowance and supplementary (rent) assistance- are income tested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rationalisation of Payments for <span class="highlight">Children</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Existing provisions allow continuation of payment of handicapped child ‘s allowance for not more than 30 days in the case of severely handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> who are temporarily absent from the family home but exclude those who are not severely handicapped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to make provisions regarding <span class="highlight">children</span> uniform the Government has also decided that the upper age limit of 25 years for payment of family allowance and double orphan’s pension will also apply to payment of additional pension and additional unemployment or sickness benefit for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maternity allowance is payable under the provisions of the Social Services Act to mothers, irrespective of means, to help meet the expenses associated with the birth of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Payment of Benefits in Respect of <span class="highlight">Children</span> living Abroad <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provisions in the Social Services Act currently enable family allowance, including handicapped child’s allowance and double orphan’s pension, and additional pension or supporting parent’s benefit or additional unemployment or sickness benefit for <span class="highlight">children</span> to be paid for a child living abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of this the Bill provides that such payments will not in future be made for <span class="highlight">children</span> outside Australia unless: A child is temporarily abroad; a child is living abroad pending migration to Australia within four years after the commencement of the benefit; and in respect of additional pension/benefit a child is living abroad with a person who is himself receiving an Australian pension or benefit overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill provides for amendments to the Repatriation Act and associated Acts to give effect to the Government’s decisions covering: Nominations of persons to repatriation determining authorities by organisations representing dependants of deceased veterans and exservicewomen; the provision for pulmonary tuberculosis to be dealt with in the same way as other disabilities; automatic adjustment of the main repatriation pensions in accordance with movements in the consumer price index only once a year; the provision of an upper age limit of 25 years for student <span class="highlight">children</span> undertaking full time education, in respect of whom service pensioners receive additional allowances to their basic service pensions; the provision for incometestfree pensions to be frozen at their present cash level and additions to income-test-free pensions to become subject to the normal income test as applied to pensioners under 70 years of age; and the removal of references to sustenance allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provision has been made for the imposition of an upper age limit for the payment of additional pension in respect of student <span class="highlight">children</span> who are in the care, custody and control of service pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now proposed that an upper disqualifying age limit of 25 years be applied in respect of the additional allowances paid to service pensioners who are supporting student <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, allowances already in payment in respect of student <span class="highlight">children</span> 25 years and over will continue while students are undertaking full time education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, the Bill amends the definition of ‘dependant’ in relation to a pensioner to impose an upper age limit of 25 years on student dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> of pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also amends the definition of ‘dependant’, in relation to an eligible pensioner, to impose an upper age limit of 25 years on student dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> of pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of our (adult) <span class="highlight">children</span> joined us for part of this time while they were on holidays. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That as citizens of Victoria and parents of State school <span class="highlight">children</span>, we are most concerned that the quality of education available in our school be of the highest possible standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer, in a similar vein to the question asked by  Senator Young,  to the terrorist attacks in Rhodesia resulting in the murder of many hundreds of innocent men, women and <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was intended to introduce an administratively difficult and unjust means test on family allowances which would partly have the effect of penalising poor families whose <span class="highlight">children</span> helped out by earning small amounts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These actions started with the first legislative act of the Government in 1976 of abolishing the subsidised health and pharmaceutical benefits scheme and continued with a long campaign conducted by Government members against the unemployed and with the failure to increase benefits to pensioners and <span class="highlight">children</span> as well as supplementary benefits in the time the Government has been in power and they culminate in this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that there are some 200,000 single unemployed beneficiaries with no <span class="highlight">children</span> who are totally or almost totally dependent on unemployment benefit cheques. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further reason can be seen from the manner in which this legislation and the manner in which this Government, since it has been in power, have failed to recognise- it has frequently taken steps to disadvantage them- families with <span class="highlight">children</span>, particularly families of those in receipt of various social security benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allowances for pensioners’ <span class="highlight">children</span> and beneficiaries’ <span class="highlight">children</span> have not been increased at all by this Government, not in this Budget or in any previous Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this legislation the <span class="highlight">children</span> of pensioners or beneficiaries who manage to get one or other of the tertiary scholarships available in this country will not have family allowances paid on their behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will have the situation, once this legislation comes into being, where the <span class="highlight">children</span> of those who are well off, who have no scholarship, will attract the family allowance while the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the poor, those in the lower and middle income groups, who have a scholarship, will attract no allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not make up for it and it does not get away from the argument,  Senator, that  your <span class="highlight">children</span> and my <span class="highlight">children</span>- separate <span class="highlight">children</span>- who may not have scholarships will attract family allowances whereas the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the poor - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">children</span> will not have a benefit paid at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added to these thingsthat the family allowance is eroded in value, that the allowances for pensioners’ <span class="highlight">children</span> and the allowance for rental assistance have been eroded because they have not been increased, and that <span class="highlight">children</span> who get a tertiary allowance of some kind will not have the family allowance paid in respect of them- other things have been done without warning, such as the maternity benefit being abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to the Government that a pensioner or beneficiary who has three or four <span class="highlight">children</span> will lose about $30 in the first year because of the changeover to the new system of child endowment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He berated the Government for what might have been- about the fact that the Government, in the Budget, decided to tax some income earned by <span class="highlight">children</span> by reducing the family allowance paid to the parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However,  Senator Grimes  went on to say that the family allowance had been abolished for those parents whose <span class="highlight">children</span> were getting a Tertiary Education Assistance scheme allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1976 the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance was increased from $10 to $15. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has extended the eligibility for the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance to include lesser handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>, substantially handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>, where the family income is low. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eligibility for the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance has been extended to cover 16-year- olds to 25-year-olds who are not in receipt of an invalid pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A benefit is paid to organisations providing residential accommodation for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rebates were taken away from the father when the family allowance was introduced, but previously the low income father with a large number of <span class="highlight">children</span> was never able to claim all the rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under some conditions it is also payable to persons who have custody, care and control of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it happened to be twins, triplets of quintuplets that the mother gave birth to, each of those <span class="highlight">children</span> should have been regarded as an individual child for the purpose of the maternity allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a whole year governments throughout the world will be endeavouring to enhance the lives of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it discriminates against the <span class="highlight">children</span> who are born in late 1978 or early 1980. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One question arises in my mind on this matter: On my calculations, the change in the method of payment of family allowances from a four-weekly basis to a monthly basis will mean that parents with four <span class="highlight">children</span> will receive $32 less in a full year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill represents a brutal assault on something like two million Australian men, women and <span class="highlight">children</span> who are dependent in some way on social services; two million people whose standard of living lies in the calloused hands of this Government- hands that have become calloused because the Government has spent the last 34 months wiping its hands of every pre-election promise it made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To cut a long story short, a family with five <span class="highlight">children</span> is now worse off by $8 a week by way of loss of purchasing power than it was in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Grimes also required information for the Opposition with regard to family allowances for <span class="highlight">children</span> living abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I state briefly that family allowances will continue to be paid for <span class="highlight">children</span> outside Australia where the child is temporarily absent or the child is living abroad pending migration to Australia and will arrive in Australia within four years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Family allowances will cease to be payable for <span class="highlight">children</span> who have never been in Australia and who do not intend to migrate to Australia within four years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be no change in the arrangements for payment of family allowances for <span class="highlight">children</span> who are already in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly, that is the outline of the changes with regard to family allowances for <span class="highlight">children</span> abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I state again briefly that this Bill extends eligibility for the handicapped child’s allowance to full-time <span class="highlight">children</span> up to the age of 25 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill brings the position of handicapped students into line with other provisions of the Act relating to student <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no way in which the Hayden alternative budget has provided for additional pensions for <span class="highlight">children</span> to be indexed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clause prevents the payment of an additional pension for <span class="highlight">children</span> who are living ‘permanently abroad and separated from the parent’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can understand the Australian electorate objecting to the use of taxpayers’ money to pay benefits to <span class="highlight">children</span> under such circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So that they can establish themselves, the parents then send their <span class="highlight">children</span> home for several years to their grandparents because family ties are very close. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether we agree with it or not, the parents feel that their <span class="highlight">children</span> are better off back in their own countries with their grandparents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clause has been introduced because the family allowance scheme is a family allowance for <span class="highlight">children</span> living within Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clause gives effect to the Government’s decision to withdraw additional payments for <span class="highlight">children</span> outside Australia unless the child is temporarily absent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a family allowance scheme of the Government for Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> and it will continue to be paid in cases of temporary absence or where the child will arrive within four years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allowance will cease to be payable for <span class="highlight">children</span> who have never been in Australia and whose parents do not intend to bring them to Australia within four years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no changes in arrangements for payment of the family allowance for <span class="highlight">children</span> already in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are taking this opportunity to say that it is a family allowance scheme for the benefit of <span class="highlight">children</span> who are in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are two provisoschildren who are temporarily absent or will be coming here within four years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allowance will also be paid in respect of such <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that this provision does not refer only to family allowances; it refers also to allowances for <span class="highlight">children</span> of pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have some philosophical difficulties about a country such as Australia that actively encourages migrants, has them working and paying taxes and then, because one of their <span class="highlight">children</span> happens to be living out of the country, deprives them of benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A married couple separate and the wife takes the <span class="highlight">children</span> back to Greece - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He still has an obligation to support his <span class="highlight">children</span> who are living overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister says that the payment still will be made to him so that he can transmit it overseas for the support of his <span class="highlight">children</span>, that is all right, but from a reading of the clause I would not have thought that that was so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a payment that was never made to <span class="highlight">children</span> in this category until 1976 when the family allowance scheme was introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were talking about paying an allowance for <span class="highlight">children</span> who had never been in Australia and who would not be brought to Australia in the foreseeable future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The exclusion of <span class="highlight">children</span> who are living overseas and who may never come to Australia is thought to be a reasonable amendment to this clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us assume that two parents with their <span class="highlight">children</span> are resident in Australia, the family breaks up- there is a divorce or they just separate- and the mother goes home with the <span class="highlight">children</span> to their country of origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She has custody of the <span class="highlight">children</span> and possibly there is a maintenance order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The working father in Australia has to pay a contribution towards the upkeep of the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does he get paid an allowance to transmit it home for the benefit of his <span class="highlight">children</span> who will be living in another country for in excess of four years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She may have an order against her husband who remains in Australia and, therefore, there is no pension payable to her or allowance payable in respect of her <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that whether she receives a pension in respect of the <span class="highlight">children</span> or whether she gets support for the <span class="highlight">children</span> would depend largely upon what action she has taken under the new and unknown clause 16 of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She may not have a claim under clause 16 to any entitlement in respect of the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He has an obligation to support his wife and <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is said now that because his wife decides to take the <span class="highlight">children</span> back home he will get no assistance from the Department of Social Security to support the <span class="highlight">children</span> which the Australian court gave him an obligation to support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a situation where the wife stayed in Australia with the <span class="highlight">children</span> she would receive a family allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case cited by  Senator Cavanagh  we seem to be talking about <span class="highlight">children</span> who are in the custody of the wife. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1977 legislation was altered to provide that a partner of the marriage could be left with the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This change was made for the benefit of the male because the previous legislation related only to a wife left with <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as the case may be, of the child or <span class="highlight">children</span> in relation to whom the first-mentioned person is the supporting parent and that that person has taken such action to obtain such maintenance as the Director-General considers reasonable . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, what is the position of the person who has a case for maintenance or for the provision of the <span class="highlight">children</span> and who has taken action when the words ‘person has not taken the action’, are inserted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The abolition of this benefit, combined with the failure to increase the allowances for pensioners’ <span class="highlight">children</span> and other beneficiaries’ <span class="highlight">children</span> and the failure to index the family allowances will contribute to the difficulties of low income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These clauses prohibit the payment of child endowment on behalf of <span class="highlight">children</span> who are recipents of any of these scholarships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think all honourable senators have had letters from groups and individuals who will be quite severely affected by this provision, particularly those in country areas who have <span class="highlight">children</span> living in cities and trying to study at tertiary institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although we do not oppose the change we merely point out that in the first year, which includes the payment date of 1 5 May, there will be a loss to parents with three or four <span class="highlight">children</span>, which would I think include most parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that when my <span class="highlight">children</span>- I am sure this applies to the majority of honourable senators who have <span class="highlight">children</span>- contracted measles the doctor was not contacted as it was known that measles was a relatively minor complaint, a <span class="highlight">children</span>’s complaint, that could be coped with quite well at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I accept, as  Senator Keeffe  has said, that this is an opportunity to have a wide examination of all the theories that have been noted with regard to these distressing deaths of very young <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This added burden will be felt not only by workers on lower incomes but also by other disadvantaged sections of the community, in particular the <span class="highlight">children</span> of this country, who will suffer as a result of the severe cuts in education that have been made in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My recollection is that there are three non-government schools in Australia of Ananda Marga origin which are duly certified by the State governments concerned as conforming to the State laws and the standards for secular education of the <span class="highlight">children</span> concerned and which are in fact inspected by those States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I have several groups funded by the Educational Research and Development Committee investigating the effects of differing educational practices on the learning of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill will extend the range of circumstances in which a court can order the parties to confer with a counsellor, or can order a counsellor to report to it, on the welfare of <span class="highlight">children</span> of the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the Minister consider initiating such an arrangement in Australia and possibly expanding it so that every business could adopt a nearby school so that <span class="highlight">children</span> could regularly visit the business for the purpose of inspecting and learning production processes, as well as adult endeavours, through in-plant and in-office involvement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to Professor Chipman ‘s call yesterday for a new national school examination to evaluate the basic skills of <span class="highlight">children</span> in arithmetic, elementary natural science, English expression and comprehension and clear thinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This was made clear in the 1976 report of the Select Committee which was titled ‘Learning Difficulties in <span class="highlight">Children</span> and Adults’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us take the situation of an ordinary family composed of a breadwinner, his spouse and a couple of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In practical terms, that means something like 2,000 cases, many of them involving family law maintenance, property, custody and access matters and how distressing those matters are when they involve <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In such a plaintive analysis, by merely examining the prefix  ‘Mrs’ to  a person’s surname, he did not account for the social implications to the divorced, the separated and the effective breadwinners often because of a strained domestic situation or because work was a means of supporting a family suffering tremendous financial hardship due to illness or accident or even a means for a mother to seek relief and companionship on a five-hour twilight shift while the husband handled the family pressures of a prolonged terminal illness of one of their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, 1 wish to pay recognition to the sacrifices of and the assistance from my wife, Jocelyn, and four <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Looking at these figures, one sees that an unemployed married couple with two <span class="highlight">children</span> on the pension which was allowed before the Budgetfortunately it was increased- received $109.30. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The same situation could be shown to apply to people who have more than two <span class="highlight">children</span> and to single people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, that has occurred through positive government policies at State and Federal Government levels to encourage tertiary education to a degree higher than had previously applied and to provide better opportunities for <span class="highlight">children</span> at the secondary level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think that one can fairly point to a society like that, a society which has been, per capita, the greatest contributor to United Nations organisations for the relief of refugees and for the assistance of <span class="highlight">children</span> throughout the world and say that it has a more devalued view of human life than a society like Australia which is more concerned with its own economic problems perennially than with international problems of concern such as the ones I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have letters that are heartrending- letters written by six-year-old or seven-year-old <span class="highlight">children</span> and sent by their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been said, when letters are received from six-year-old and seven-year-old <span class="highlight">children</span>, who do not know anything about life, asking us not to murder <span class="highlight">children</span>, those who are putting together the campaign had better look at their own moral standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They talk about killing <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If they really care about the health of the women and <span class="highlight">children</span> in the Australian Capital Territory they should go out and find those butchers and do something about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been talk of providing <span class="highlight">children</span> for childless couples to adopt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If people are so anxious to provide <span class="highlight">children</span> for childless couples to adopt, I suggest that they establish stud farms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But they must respect my right to weigh up the pros and cons and make those decisions which safeguard my life and ensure that my <span class="highlight">children</span> grow up in the best possible circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I expect governments to legislate to protect me from charlatans, rogues and exploiters and to promote a good life for my <span class="highlight">children</span>, and I will make the decision about whether I should have <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I could not speak on this matter with any honesty if I did not refer with grave distaste to the letters I have received from young <span class="highlight">children</span>- as young as six or seven years- on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very strongly tempted to quote some of these letters in the Senate but I would not like to place on public record the extent to which <span class="highlight">children</span> of that age have been forced to utter sentiments of which they could have no possible understanding and which in their innocence they have been caused to support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They include such statements as, ‘Dear  Senator, Please  do not hurt little <span class="highlight">children</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>using young <span class="highlight">children</span> and form letters, is deplorable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like them to commit themselves to devoting an equal proportion of their time, of their vigour, of their ability and of their wit to caring for the <span class="highlight">children</span> in orphanages and <span class="highlight">children</span> who are poor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those people who are sincere in campaigning against abortion should examine the way in which their time is apportioned and decide whether at least half of their time ought not to be devoted to the fostering of <span class="highlight">children</span> from Asia- the <span class="highlight">children</span> who are orphaned and the <span class="highlight">children</span> whom I described earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In a perfect society those <span class="highlight">children</span> of unwanted pregnancies- I am not suggesting that every unwanted pregnancy produces an unwanted child, but certainly a massive number of them do- would obtain the love, the care and the nourishment that other <span class="highlight">children</span> receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the six-year-old and seven-year-old <span class="highlight">children</span> who have written to me in language, as was suggested by  Senator Mason,  which amounts to committing one of the most obscene acts that I have experienced in a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But there is no way that these people can say in all honesty and sincerity- I believe that the majority of these people are sincerethat the standards they have established for their <span class="highlight">children</span> will prevail once those <span class="highlight">children</span> get out from under the influence of the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In our so-called enlightened schools on which we are spending so much money no attempt is being made to teach <span class="highlight">children</span> some of the facts of life to prepare them for their development as young people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me it is a recognition that in this day and age, instead of our living in the unenlightened society that has prevailed in this country and many other Western countries for centuries, the veil is lifting and people will see reason and will be able to assist those who want to plan their lives and be able to plan their families so that they will support the <span class="highlight">children</span> that they can afford to rear and the ones that they feel that they are capable of seeing through their early childhood on to maturity, and in that way fulfil their proper destiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many school <span class="highlight">children</span> are doing the same today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That as citizens of Victoria and parents of State school <span class="highlight">children</span>, we are most concerned that the quality of education available in our school be of the highest possible standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the Minister’s attention to the finding of the recent health survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics that 2.6 per cent of <span class="highlight">children</span> aged between one and five years had not received any triple-antigen vaccination for whooping cough, tetanus and diptheria and that 3.8 per cent of <span class="highlight">children</span> in the same age group had not received polio vaccination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister whether action is being taken to ensure that all <span class="highlight">children</span> will receive these vaccinations to protect them from the risk of potentially fatal illnesses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Specifically, these goods include car jacks which collapse under stress, rotary paint strippers which can cause eye injury, <span class="highlight">children</span>’s tents without adequate ventilation, portable fire extinguishers which do not conform to proper standards, <span class="highlight">children</span>’s bath fun foam which can cause suffocation and baby walkers and folding tables which can cause injury to young <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Also, for the information of honourable senators, I have a statement outlining the information and electoral education services which the Australian Electoral Office has been developing over the last two years and in particular the most significant advances that have occurred in the areas of ethnic groups, Aborigines and school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been making most significant moves especially in the areas of ethnic groups, Aboriginals and school <span class="highlight">children</span> as well as aiming to reach the community as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned earlier,  Mr President,  the responsibility seen for the development of electoral education programs for school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We go to tremendous measures to protect the life of a single child; why do we not take similar measures to protect the lives of hundreds of <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be necessary for us to improve the dietary position of whole Aboriginal communities in certain areas in order to allow <span class="highlight">children</span> to be conceived and reared with sufficient nutrition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not an expert on these matters, but  Dr Kalokerinos  is one doctor who has written so urgently about the protein shortage in the nutrition of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, if all these <span class="highlight">children</span> were to suddenly die by some sudden disaster caused by flood or by earthquake, we would be racing to the assistance of those communities, but because it is an insidious thing which has been suddenly revealed to us in the health report we seem not to give it the importance that we should. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One action that can be taken to help- and this is a point that I pursued with respect to education- is for more and more Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> to be trained as teachers aides and teachers to work among their own people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many hundreds of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> in the Northern Territory being educated at the Kormilda and Yirara Aboriginal Colleges who have the ability to become health aides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Several months ago all communities with <span class="highlight">children</span> at Dhupuma College were contacted by my Department in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say it is not a free pass because although the employee gets a pass for himself, his wife and <span class="highlight">children</span> he then must pay $100 for each member of his family plus the costs of the sleeping berths on the train and the costs of meals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Treasurer aware that the levying of sales tax on equipment or toys that aid in the development of mentally or physically handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> places a heavy financial burden on the parents of those <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In other words, say, a major mechanical defect or perhaps as our teenage <span class="highlight">children</span> may say ‘a vehicle which is clapped out’ because these vehicles also are sold to Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They used them for scratching their initials on their iron picks and shovels and then gave them to their <span class="highlight">children</span> to play with, and they disappeared thereafter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The unit we have planned contains a W.C. compartment; a small area with stainless steel tub for washing <span class="highlight">children</span> and clothes, the tub being sufficiently large for both purposes; a shower cubicle, and a kitchenette unit containing stainless steel sink, basic shelving, with space available for a refrigerator and a future electric stove. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision, as I said, simply allowed any male Commonwealth employee who became the father of a new baby to take a week’s leave to assist his wife to look after their other <span class="highlight">children</span> and to get to know his new baby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The husband and wife might already have two or three small <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody in the Senate who has been in a home at the time of the birth of a new baby could not possibly claim that a young father who has to cope with two or three other <span class="highlight">children</span>, a new baby and a wife who may not be 100 per cent fit is taking leave for recreational purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surveys show that 50 per cent of women do return to work after maternity leave despite the enormous difficulties of obtaining child care for <span class="highlight">children</span> under 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, I do not think that there are many cases of women who are actually making a career of producing <span class="highlight">children</span> so as to qualify for maternity leave year after year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, there is a serious lack of child care facilities, particularly for very small <span class="highlight">children</span>, which makes the provision of one year’s maternity leave for public servants not a totally satisfactory provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no provisions for easier entry into the work force for women who stay out of the work force until their <span class="highlight">children</span> are of school age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To allow leave only to mothers who bear their own <span class="highlight">children</span> is discriminatory against adopting parents, and I do not believe that there is any proper case for penalising adopting parents in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that she must have had her tongue in her cheek when she was talking about a week’s paternity leave to allow the father to get to know his newborn child and at the same time look after the other <span class="highlight">children</span> of the family while the mother is in hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the father cannot organise his holidays in that nine months so that he can have at least a week of his holidays shortly after his wife gets out of hospital or, if they already have a family, he cannot organise his holidays so that he can look after the <span class="highlight">children</span> while she is in hospital there is something radically wrong with the system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the striking exception of the family allowance scheme of this Government, very little has been done in a financial sense to encourage families to raise <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In presenting this report relating to the impact of television on the development and learning behaviour of <span class="highlight">children</span>, we bring to the Senate an account of one of the most important and challenging inquiries ever undertaken by this Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we moved from State to State, we became aware of a widespread public concern with the influence of television on <span class="highlight">children</span> and young people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span> and young people watch television for about 20 hours a week or nearly three hours a day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Research has established that by the time some <span class="highlight">children</span> leave school they will have spent more time in front of the home television screen than in the classroom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were more concerned, however, with an estimated 20 per cent of <span class="highlight">children</span> who view in excess of 30 and sometimes as high as 80 hours of television a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidence presented to the Committee showed that these <span class="highlight">children</span>, because of certain social inhibitions, tended to retreat to a world of their own where television became virtually their sole companion and their main source of information and entertainment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">children</span> are particularly vulnerable to the influence of television and the ones for which we have the greatest concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concern about the impact of television on <span class="highlight">children</span> ranged widely over many issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effects of televised violence emerged as the major issue but there was also much concern about the effects of constant exposure of <span class="highlight">children</span> to programs that portrayed male and female role stereotypes, unreal or foreign life-styles and the gratuitous use of sex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee’s attention was drawn to advertising that sought to exploit the natural credulity of <span class="highlight">children</span> and encouraged them to pressure their parents for products they saw advertised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Others expressed concern that much of the advertising directed at <span class="highlight">children</span> encouraged them in dietary habits that could pose long term dental and nutritional health risks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Educationalists and parents were concerned that television is adversely affecting the learning behaviour of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was claimed that escapist material mainly watched by <span class="highlight">children</span> is stifling the development of creative instincts and imagination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These include such things as shortened attention spans, lack of concentration, difficulties in speech and language development and the inability of some <span class="highlight">children</span> to develop concepts and logical thoughts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that we have identified a number of crucially important issues relating to the impact of television on <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the available evidence and from our own analysis of programs we concluded that much of the criticism directed at <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs offered by both the national and commercial services is well founded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that commercial television by its very nature is not geared to cater adequately for minority audiences including <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee has recommended that <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programming be taken out of the arena of industry economics and that programs be produced by an independent production unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concern expressed to us about the possible harmful effects of television and the complaints about the long history of neglect of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programming did not seem to be shared by those in the television or advertising industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who advocated the urgent introduction of media educational courses in the schools pointed out that since television is such an important influence in the learning process, <span class="highlight">children</span> should be taught discrimination in its use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was also suggested to the Committee that much could be done to improve <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television if adults had a greater awareness of television’s potential to influence and became critical viewers themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other evidence showed that many parents were concerned with what their <span class="highlight">children</span> learnt from television but were unsure of how to control effectively their <span class="highlight">children</span> ‘s viewing habits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of interest to note that as a result of our public hearings and those of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in its inquiry into selfregulation for broadcasters, a great deal of public interest has been generated in <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With 1979 being designated as Year of the Child by the United Nations, we expect this interest to be sustained and develop even further as community attention focuses more sharply on the needs of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the great amount of interest in this inquiry and likely continued public interest, I inform the Senate that we will be looking at the subject of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television again in about eighteen months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I state that this whole study highlights the changing situation applying to those who, in one way or another, are entrusted with the care and management of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The role of schools and community organisations takes on a new responsibility, in association with homes and parents, so that the wonderful characteristics of television may be used to assist our <span class="highlight">children</span> to become informed, happy and useful citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While that may have been in the interests of my <span class="highlight">children</span>- I firmly believe that to be so- I personally feel deprived as a result of having to make that decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, one of the Committee’s findings, which were made on the basis of evidence put to it, was that the average viewing time which <span class="highlight">children</span> spend watching television is of the order of 20 to 22 hours a week but one-fifth of the child population of this country watches television for much longer than that- up to 60 to 70 hours a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to consider how much we as a parliament should be concerned about those <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is very important that that review process take place so that a committee of this Senate is not treated in 1978 as committees of this Parliament have been treated over many years in dealing with matters relating to television and particularly <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the report deals very kindly with them in this regard because in suggesting government intervention it suggests that governments should also make a financial commitment to that intervention in terms of the quality of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that if we start educating adults or even <span class="highlight">children</span> now to understand the nature of the electronic media, by the time that process has been implemented and has been under way for a few years the whole nature of the electronic media will have changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is subject to review when information is received from all States of the <span class="highlight">children</span> in the four years and five years age groups who are actually attending pre-schools in each State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You must understand that is been organised for the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Hospital and the Maternity Hospital in Lima only, and that any donations at all should be sent as a private donation to either hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general resources programs are general recurrent grants, including short term emergency assistance for non-government schools catering for country <span class="highlight">children</span>, and building and equipment grants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-92-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The specific purpose programs are for child migrant education, disadvantaged schools and students in disadvantaged country areas, special education for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> including <span class="highlight">children</span> living in institutions, services and development and special projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-92-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, is it a fact that the decisions of such colleges in fixing fees for 1 979 and the future of thousands of <span class="highlight">children</span> proposing to undertake courses will be dependent upon such a decision? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that the National Acoustic Laboratory services to hearing impaired <span class="highlight">children</span> on Aboriginal settlements in Queensland are severely hindered for want of funds? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it true that NAL personnel do not visit Aboriginal settlements for the purpose of testing hearing problems in deaf <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it further true that hearing aids are posted by the NAL to schools on Aboriginal settlements and that these aids are passed on to the <span class="highlight">children</span> by school authorities without any NAL staff being on hand to ensure that the correct aid is given to a particular child and without any proper training being given by NAL staff to the school authorities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We understand that this is the same film which is now known under the title  Drink No Longer Water  and which was viewed by the Film Censorship Board, as a result of the Committee’s inquiries, and classified NRC- not recommended for <span class="highlight">children</span>- by the Film Censorship Board itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#debate-70">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think, too, that we should have a look at providing these teaching facilities not only in the secondary schools, where traditionally languages have been taught, but also in the primary schools, where <span class="highlight">children</span> are very adept at learning languages if they are given the proper opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#debate-71">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That as citizens of Victoria and parents of State school <span class="highlight">children</span>, we are most concerned that the quality of education available in our school be of the highest possible standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In one case the <span class="highlight">children</span> have been left behind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-104-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sales Tax Exemptions on Equipment for Mentally and Physically Handicapped <span class="highlight">Children</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-108-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 17 November 1978  (Hansard,  page 2181)  Senator Gietzelt  asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice concerning the possible exemption from sales tax of equipment and toys purchased on the recommendation of a doctor, for use by mentally or physically handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-108-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was ably helped by his wife Margaret who had a great affinity with Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> and with other <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the pre-school block grant that is made to the States, and in particular to Tasmania, for the year 1978-79 the total Commonwealth block grant for pre-schools is $32.75m, which is divided among the States in proportion to the number of four and five year-old <span class="highlight">children</span> attending pre-schools in each State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in one instance we are still awaiting details of the number of <span class="highlight">children</span> attending pre-school so that we can make the final grant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that in this International Year of the Child all Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> be considered an equal part of this country’s wealth and that the Health Act be amended so that Pensioners Health Benefit Cards can be issued to those receiving Supporting Parents Benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He made no commitment with regard to additional pensions with regard to <span class="highlight">children</span>, he made no estimate to show that he would give a greater allowable free area of income to pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although I would agree with  Senator Grimes  when he says that pensioners, the people who are aged, invalid and sick, are the most vulnerable, I also need to recognise the needs of families- the single income family with several small <span class="highlight">children</span>, the family with commitments to purchasing a house to give security to the family and the family with a woman who is unable to work and who has commitments at home to her own <span class="highlight">children</span> and a desire to be at home with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Families with young <span class="highlight">children</span> make up a great part of our pensioner population today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody who has had <span class="highlight">children</span>, anybody who has any imagination, realises that when there are young <span class="highlight">children</span> in a family the need for health care rises dramatically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only today I had put to me a case of a widow with four <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This widow on a pension with four <span class="highlight">children</span> was denied any rebate because one of her boys had just turned 16, could not get a job and was on unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet they all have <span class="highlight">children</span> to raise in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is a rare opportunity to demonstrate that intensified public and governmental awareness of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s needs can lead to concrete action of immense and, above all, lasting benefit to mankind’s future- its <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those are fine words and yet some <span class="highlight">children</span> on pensions are paid a larger <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance than others, some <span class="highlight">children</span> on pensions receive an education allowance and some do not, and some <span class="highlight">children</span> on pensions receive the cost of school requisites, fares and other educational expenses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How can we differentiate between <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the value of the pension goes down there is less money in these homes for education and so the <span class="highlight">children</span> get worse and worse educations and a harder and harder start in life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been no rise in the <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance in any of our pension schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know that in my home as- I am sure happens in homes throughout the nation- I teach my <span class="highlight">children</span> that if they make a promise they should keep that promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can remember that even at a very early age one of my own <span class="highlight">children</span> sang a song which began ‘If you give a promise then keep a promise’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are we not to expect that the Government should keep its promises just the same as we teach our <span class="highlight">children</span> in our own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Very many <span class="highlight">children</span> are involved when we are talking about low income earners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we are talking about pensioners’ benefits we are also talking about <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind all honourable senators that this is the Year of the Child and there are many <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia who are hungry, who do not have adequate housing and who do not even have adequate clothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am simply saying that in this International Year of the Child there are in Australia many <span class="highlight">children</span> who are hungry and who are not being housed or clothed properly because their parents happen to be in receipt of pensioner benefits from this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then she had the audacity to say at the end of her speech that <span class="highlight">children</span> in this country are not clothed and are going hungry because their parents are in receipt of pensioner benefits from this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet  Senator Coleman  has the audacity to say to the people of Australia that there are <span class="highlight">children</span> in this country who are hungry and unclothed because their parents are in receipt of pensioner benefits from this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister’s attention also been drawn to the comment from the Queensland Education Department that Federal members of Parliament, including Cabinet Ministers, had no right to go around handing out holidays to Queensland school <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do any provisions exist which allow for relief in cases of hardship arising amongst families which rely on the mails for educating outback <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst no provisions exist under postal legislation which would provide relief for outback families where <span class="highlight">children</span> are being educated by correspondence, the Government does provide correspondence allowances under the Assistance for Isolated <span class="highlight">Children</span> scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The analysis by the Taxpayers ‘ Association seeks to compare the real disposable income of a taxpayer receiving average weekly earnings and with a wholly dependent spouse and two <span class="highlight">children</span> in 1975-76 and 1978-79. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each school will, therefore, have the responsibility of catering first for the <span class="highlight">children</span> in its own area but will then be free to accept as many other pupils who wish to come to the school as may reasonably be placed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Three small <span class="highlight">children</span> were, by consent of their father, in the legal custody of their mother following a divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two people or groups of people were thereafter concerned with the welfare of those small <span class="highlight">children</span>: their maternal grandparents and their father. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, had each party started in the right court, two different courts would have had power to deal with custody of the same <span class="highlight">children</span> between the same parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I got the impression that they felt that there could not possibly be the kind of world in which this could happen and that for some reason or other, although it is possible for other groups in the community such as families, organisations and business boards to agree on things- even school <span class="highlight">children</span> have mock parliaments at times- this Parliament is different, that it is immune to such rationality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be our <span class="highlight">children</span> and grandchildren who do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A great deal of work has been done by the Federal Government, by State governments and by the voluntary organisations in this country to make it a fitting year of celebration in recognition of the rights of <span class="highlight">children</span> and of our responsibilities to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Articles may also be written which express the expectation that at the end of the year we will be able to say that we have solved all of the problems of our <span class="highlight">children</span> or that we have discharged our responsibilities to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the media will give their support, as they have done previously, to the efforts of the governments and the people of this country to draw attention in this year to the needs and rights of <span class="highlight">children</span> and our responsibilities to them, and to see that it is a year that is enjoyed by <span class="highlight">children</span> in whatever way they are able to enjoy it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another matter that would have to be taken into consideration is that if there were the same free area of income as applies to age pensions a person with a dependent spouse and two <span class="highlight">children</span> would be able to have an income of over $250 a week before the unemployment benefit ceased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Six hundred million men, women and <span class="highlight">children</span> living in absolute poverty without access to the basic amenities which we take for granted is, of course, a very frightening situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My attention has been drawn to the plight of one parent families, and in particular, to the differences which exist in the benefits paid to <span class="highlight">children</span> who are under the auspices of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs and those cared for by the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer the Minister to the United Nations declaration which states that it is the fundamental right of all <span class="highlight">children</span> to have equality of educational opportunities’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of this, will the Minister investigate the possibility of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of civilian widows being paid an education allowance similar to that paid to the <span class="highlight">children</span> of war widows? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I note what was said by  Senator Missen  with regard to the education allowance for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of civilian widows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are <span class="highlight">children</span> from unemployed families where unemployment is becoming a way of life for several generations who live in the same street, the same house and the same suburb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think it would be desirable if in many of our policies relating to social issues more consideration were given to the situation which exists in more primitive societies than ours in which much more care and attention is given to the wider ramifications of family relationships than in the typical Australian family as it is sometimes described with a husband, a wife, two <span class="highlight">children</span> and the television set. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The organisation and formulation of government policies- I make this comment irrespective of party lines- which bear on the family situation are very much structured towards encouraging the continuance of the nuclear family and against the possibility of encouraging wider and more supportive relationships in families which involve more than just a husband, a wife and two <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I now refer to one other very important aspect of this Bill which seeks to extend the range of circumstances in which a court can order the parties to confer with a counsellor or order a counsellor to report to it on the welfare of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Situations have arisen where the Court may seek information about the <span class="highlight">children</span> (e.g. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Though these situations are not likely to arise very often there seems to be no good reason for the present restriction which may prevent the Court from obtaining a report or from taking action in the interests of the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill seeks to extend the range of circumstances in which a court can order the panics to confer with a counsellor or order a counsellor to report to it, on the welfare of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Section 62 is amended to extend the circumstances in which a court can order the parties to confer with a counsellor or can order a counsellor to report to it on the welfare of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of the marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It confers certain powers on the courts and makes certain recommendations in relation to the welfare of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of such a marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It might not have gone as far as we might have liked but at least it did seem to take account of the fact that <span class="highlight">children</span>, young people and the community in general should not be pressured into the use of alcohol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Frankly, I do not think it would do <span class="highlight">children</span> any harm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One wonders about the Censorship Board when on the one hand it can rate a film G- suitable for general exhibition- and then, after it has had another look at the film, can rate it NRC- not recommended for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is no point whatsoever in setting up educational programs in high schools, in primary schools or, as we are now told should happen, in kindergartens, if at the same time those <span class="highlight">children</span> see their parents using on every possible occasion amounts of alcohol that can only be detrimental to their health and to their conduct and using alcohol as though they intend to go on drinking it forever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was certainly not the type of film I would want to be shown to adults, let along <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report introduced by the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts entitled ‘<span class="highlight">Children</span> and Television’ tries to come to grips in large measure with a recent phenomenon that is shaping society in a way substantially different from the way in which societies have developed in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undoubtedly it would come as a surprise to many honourable senators to see the statistics given in the Committee’s report indicating that more than 20 per cent of Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> watch more than 30 hours of television a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the effect that this has in terms of taking up time in which <span class="highlight">children</span> could be engaged in other pursuits, be they sporting, cultural, recreational, social or educative pursuits, it can be seen that for a very large section of the young community of Australia television is about the most important thing in their lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have no doubt that the production of programs such as  In The Wild  has done more to bring about the real education of Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> and adults about the country in which they live than just about any other undertaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To a large extent this has resulted from what I believe is abdication of parental responsibility for the behaviour of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It simply cannot be held that the <span class="highlight">children</span> themselves, without any involvement by parental authority, are turning on the television set and choosing what they will watch and when they will watch it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall a remark, I think it was made by  Senator Button,  when this report was first introduced, that one of the things that he had done was to get rid of the television set or limit the access to the television set which his <span class="highlight">children</span> watched. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parents usually exert little influence over their <span class="highlight">children</span>’s viewing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our data indicate that in an overwhelming majority of families, the <span class="highlight">children</span> control the use of the television set through early evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, one study reports that parents often ask advice from their <span class="highlight">children</span> when they select early evening programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If parental authorities are going to abdicate not only the responsibility but also the choice in this matter, not so much to their <span class="highlight">children</span> but to the people who decide what will be shown on the television screens, we will reach a situation in which anybody attempting to play a legitimate role in shaping the moral code, the ethical values or even the educational framework of <span class="highlight">children</span> is abdicating that responsibility to some total stranger in the programing departments of the television stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To that extent the gulf that may exist between <span class="highlight">children</span> and parents- the socalled generation gap which may be growing at an even faster rate as <span class="highlight">children</span>’s knowledge expands these days- is in part encouraged by the fact that parental authorities have done nothing to prevent it from occurring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who, for instance a couple of years ago would have been prepared to concede the point that a television show produced for <span class="highlight">children</span> in which animated glove puppets singing and dancing and mixed with a variety of live guest stars- of course the program to which I refer is  The Muppet Show-  would attract worldwide audiences larger than audiences for any other undertaking ever produced on the public media? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn briefly to the question of programming for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not simply because this is the International Year of the Child that this matter requires our attention: It is because in the whole development of television, and, in particular, in the hearings that have been conducted by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, people in the community have expressed a greater degree of concern about <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television than they have about anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who have seen the attempts of certain members of the Broadcasting Tribunal to prevent similar submissions being made to the Sydney hearings, and the way in which the Tribunal has now decided that it will accept those submissions, will also be impressed with the number and the quality of the submissions relating to <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was so much discussion about <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We thought there would be a lot of discussion about many things but there is no doubt that <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television developed as the central issue of that inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has made recommendations about the employment and the use of <span class="highlight">children</span> on television and it has made particular recommendations that the Government establish an independent <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television program production unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has recommended that there be no advertising of any form during the screening of programs designed for pre-school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that commercial interests in Australia are using the medium of television in order to have an influence on the way in which young <span class="highlight">children</span>, pre-school <span class="highlight">children</span>, react to the sale of products, and to influence them to bring pressure to bear on their mothers in the supermarkets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They also have an influence on the demands which are artificially created in the minds of young <span class="highlight">children</span> about what commercial products they demand that they should have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact it is called the Nation of the Night because it is during the night that people proceed to educate their <span class="highlight">children</span> in order to keep their country going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I turn from the political response to the humanitarian response to the claims of the displaced families of Eritrea, the 1,200,000 persons who have been made homeless, of whom, in this International Year of the Child, 400,000 are thought to be <span class="highlight">children</span> under 12 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as I know, human beings- <span class="highlight">children</span> and women- are being killed, but nobody is interested in that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Would the AttorneyGeneral agree that when family law legislation was debated in this chamber, heavy stress was laid on the need to remove the strains which had been associated with divorce jurisdiction in the past, with particular reference to the rights of <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the Attorney-General agree that this child minding service is a very valuable one, particularly when custody and access matters are being heard in view of the desirability of avoiding conflict between parents in the presence of <span class="highlight">children</span> when custody of <span class="highlight">children</span> is in dispute? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has he had reports of unfortunate incidents in the precincts of the Family Court in Brisbane since this child minding service has been closed down, particularly when <span class="highlight">children</span> have come into contact with parents from whom they have been separated for some time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the desire of the Government that we should have a great boom economy based on nuclear power, even if it were possible, at the expense of running out of these resources so that our great great grandchildren will have nothing left and will look back on our generation with contempt as the looters, the people who did not think for the future, the Huns of the 20th century in terms of exploitation, deprivation and the destruction of our resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is their <span class="highlight">children</span>’s <span class="highlight">children</span> who will suffer from this kind of policy which is being entered into by the Government with no regard whatsoever to the truth, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Each school will have the responsibility of catering first for the <span class="highlight">children</span> in its area, but then will be free to accept as many other pupils who wish to come to the school as may be reasonably placed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the recently reported figures published by the Institute of Applied Economics and Social Research which indicate that a single parent with one child requires $85.30 a week to live beyond the poverty line, and a single parent with two <span class="highlight">children</span> requires $ 103.50 to escape poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Government review the case for a special education allowance for the <span class="highlight">children</span> of single parent families? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Another area of anomaly relates to the assumed capacity of middle income families to contribute to their <span class="highlight">children</span>’s tertiary education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is generally assumed that people in the middle income bracket can easily afford to pay for part of their <span class="highlight">children</span>’s education and living costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government does expect parents to continue to meet part of their parental responsibilities with respect to student <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the premises on which the whole system is based is that in the majority of cases parents will not regard <span class="highlight">children</span> who are still students as being no longer their responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We intend to introduce further legislation for isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>, Aboriginal students and students receiving benefits under the Government’s new secondary allowances scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unfortunate that  Senator Davidson  is not present in the chamber because as  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts which investigated isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> he would be particularly interested in what we have to say here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has spoken in this place on many occasions about the need for the Government to increase its assistance to isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The payment of benefits under the Assistance for Isolated <span class="highlight">Children</span> Scheme be continued and that levels of assistance and application of the means test for additional allowances be reviewed annually so that allowances are paid at a rate commensurate with education expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Davidson  has said a number of times in this place, not one of those recommendations has been accepted by the Government to help those <span class="highlight">children</span> in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a result, <span class="highlight">children</span> who eat large quantities of such food run the risk of serious dietary deficiencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So <span class="highlight">children</span> of age one must be taught right from the start that they cannot go into a toilet for the other sex, that they cannot practise sorcery even in their childish games and that they cannot go to a public function unless they have permission from the manager to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">children</span> had received 14 days gaol in this dirty, filthy little dog-hole of a room because, allegedly, the 13-year-old child had made a pass at one of the boys and the 1 1 yearold had said ‘damn’ to her teacher at school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is difficult for parents to act in a way that would protect their <span class="highlight">children</span> from false values and standards because the <span class="highlight">children</span> are subjected to this not only in what they watch on television but also at the school canteen where the same sort of products are sold because a demand has been built up in the minds of impressionable <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I  drew particular attention to some of the findings of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts which attempted, very successfully I believe, to bring into perspective the role of television in the process of learning, socialisation and the shaping of attitudes, behaviour and beliefs of <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I take as my starting point a remark about <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television which was made in the report of the 1953 Royal Commission on Television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think that it is one of the obligations to the public of all commercial stations to provide a suitable <span class="highlight">children</span>’s program, but we do not consider that this should be laid down as a legal obligation, in the case where there is a national station operating, but should rather be a matter to be considered when the question of the general standard of the service is examined at the time a licence needs renewal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Board and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, as it was known later, in relation to <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That phenomenon has continued, and the annual report of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal for the period ending 30 June 1977 noted that there had been a further decline in some ways in the amount of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation improved in 1 977, with all but one metropolitan station televising at least 30 minutes per weekday of kindergarten programs, but a large number of country stations continued to completely ignore the programming needs of young <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the disadvantage that already exists for <span class="highlight">children</span> in isolated areas, it is to be very much regretted that the commercial television stations which have at least a penetration into those areas were not prepared to pick up part of their responsibility in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is equally regrettable that the 46th annual report of the Australian Broadcasting Commission- that for the period 1 July 1977 to 30 June 1978-contained only a very scant reference to <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only a couple of paragraphs on page 48 of the report indicated the extent to which <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television programs have been provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report certainly indicated that the new programs called  Wayzgoose  and  Living Daylights  had contributed something new to the production of Australian television for <span class="highlight">children</span>; but it is disturbing to find that some programs now continue into the nineteenth year of performance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The problem of providing a balance of programs for <span class="highlight">children</span> is dealt with in a most interesting Media Information publication entitled ‘Media and the Child’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It deals exclusively with the media and <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An article by Julie Bailey which is entitled ‘Regulatory Bodies and <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Television Committees’ makes this observation: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The history of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television committees within regulatory bodies would indicate the influence which they can have is not great. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inescapable conclusion is that unless the Tribunal is prepared to either act on a majority opinion or to delegate to the Committee its power of regulation in this field of programming, we shall yet again be faced with a continuing saga of frustration identical in both its terms and its tone to those expressed by the Australian Teachers Association in 1 944 and witnesses to the Royal Commission on television in 19S3, the Senate Select Committee on The Encouragement of Australian Production for Television (the Vincent Committee)) in 1963, the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts looking at Broadcasting in 1972-74, the Broadcasting Tribunal ‘s Self Regulation Inquiry in 1 977, the Senate Standing Committee looking into the impact of Television on <span class="highlight">Children</span> in 1978, and a repeat performance of the two previous <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Advisory Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the overwhelming weight of evidence presented in all of those inquiries critical of the commercial television stations for their lack of attention to the problem of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television, we still have no responsible reaction from those stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was so much discussion about <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We thought there would be quite a lot of discussion about many things but there is no doubt that <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television developed as the central issue of that inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some ways <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television is developing as the central issue of the inquiry that is currently under way in Sydney, despite the challenges to the power of the Tribunal and, indeed, to the personnel of the Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I drew attention in my speech on 1 March to the extent to which evidence presented to the Senate Committee indicated that <span class="highlight">children</span> made many of decisions about what was actually watched on television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parents usually exert little influence over their <span class="highlight">children</span>’s viewing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our data indicate that in an overwhelming majority of families the <span class="highlight">children</span> control the use of the television set through early evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even Australian television executives appear to be waking up to the extent to which control over the dial is exercised by <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here is a commercial television station indicating that something that is being broadcast at a time when <span class="highlight">children</span> are likely to be watching television is the sort of thing over which parents should exercise some degree of control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People do not even accept that Australian parents exercise much control over their <span class="highlight">children</span>’s viewing habits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time 79 per cent said parents did not exercise sufficient control over the amount of television and the types of program watched by their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole issue of violence on the television screen has been explored not only by the Senate Committee report but also in some considerable detail in a book entitled  <span class="highlight">Children</span> and Television  edited by Ray Brown, which although dealing mainly with American findings at least correlates these to a number of international studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The overall results indicated that <span class="highlight">children</span> who were adjudged to be initially somewhat more aggressive became significantly more aggressive as a result of viewing the  Batman  and  Superman  cartoons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, the <span class="highlight">children</span> who viewed twelve episodes of - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Misteroger’s 
 Neighbourhood became significantly more cooperative, willing to share toys and to help other <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, there is a convergence of the fairly substantial experimental evidence for short-run causation of aggression among some <span class="highlight">children</span> by viewing violence on the screen and the much less certain evidence from field studies that extensive violence viewing precedes some long-run manifestations of aggressive behaviour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should bear that in mind when talking about <span class="highlight">children</span>-  as well as acts already established, can be evoked by the viewing of violent scenes portrayed on film, TV or in the theatre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are the sorts of attitudes which have to be viewed sceptically when dealing with the regulation of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The article by Clayre goes on to deal with the responses of young <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Television plays a vital role in the process of socialisation as far as young <span class="highlight">children</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Television network and station officials should not allow on the air commercials to take advantage of <span class="highlight">children</span> by deliberately confusing reality and fantasy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Historically, decision makers in <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television have been programming officials who have had little understanding of the psychological and emotional needs of their young audiences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television is to emerge completely from the dark ages, its decision makers will have to be officials who understand and like <span class="highlight">children</span> and executives who do not simply mouth the opinions of solely conscious rating programmers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the survey printed in the book,  <span class="highlight">Children</span> in front of the small screen,  by Grant Noble in which he deals with the reaction of groups of <span class="highlight">children</span> whom he calls ‘conformist boys’, ‘rebel boys’ and ‘problem boys’, make an interesting comparison. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless we teach our <span class="highlight">children</span> wisely, our society is only 20 years from savagery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That there be no advertising of any form during the screening of programs designed for pre-school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the same applies to the control of television advertising during the period of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet in the gallup poll which I previously cited, 77 per cent of those polled said that commercials should be banned from programs designed for preschool <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that he is quite correct in drawing our attention to that point as far as <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have said, its special issue, which was published this month to mark the International Year of the Child, draws together most of the valuable Australian and overseas work done on <span class="highlight">children</span> and television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is vital that this Parliament, this community, develop an attitude towards the regulation of broadcasting and particularly broadcasting as it affects <span class="highlight">children</span>, without any consideration involving party politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the Harry Butler type of program, to  The Sullivans  type of program, to the Bill Peach type of program, which bring to Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> a better understanding of their own country, of their own social mores, and make important contributions to the development of a homogeneous Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They play a role in establishing what I believe are proper community standards, proper information about this nation and, as I have said earlier, from the work of the Nobles, they play a particularly important role in helping migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> to understand and to adapt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose, in conclusion, it is best to state what is one ‘s approach to <span class="highlight">children</span> in this sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am delighted to be able to go back to a political and social philosopher for whom I have the highest regard, John Locke, who, in writing about <span class="highlight">children</span>, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the sort of attitude that is necessary that people with the responsibility to develop and broadcast programs for <span class="highlight">children</span> should bear in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is prepared to exercise those statutory powers that it has to bring about an improvement in <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television; unless it is prepared to look again at the recommendation of the 1953 royal commission that some form of legal compulsion for better and more adequate <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television should be considered; I believe that the tribunal will have proved itself to be a waste of the time and effort of people who hoped that public participation in the shaping of broadcasting standards and attitudes would bring about a response such that legitimate commercial considerations would be married with the desires of the community and the right that the community has that the public airways should serve legitimate public needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One class of family trust with which I would have no quarrel is that of testamentary trusts, those which come into operation on a testator’s death and are designed simply as a convenient means of administering the estate, in particular and most commonly as a vehicle for the keeping of family property together for the lifetime of the surviving spouse while still allowing the possibility of ultimate and equitable distribution among the testator’s <span class="highlight">children</span> or whoever else he wants to benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Has the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications seen an article which appeared on page 107 of the  Sun Herald  dated 25 March 1979 and which details step by step a number of ways in which marihuana can be used and is being used currently by <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am not aware also that the article has been passed around among school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that if the article gives <span class="highlight">children</span> the idea of how they can get access to marihuana and how they can use it, it is to be deplored, although I hesitate to make a judgment without having seen the article. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important for us during the course of this year to consider those areas in which there is discrimination against a child not only in this country but also in other parts of the world where there are not laws to protect <span class="highlight">children</span> in the same way as there are to protect adults. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Declaration of Rights of the Child which was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 20 November 1959 was designed to provide that nations recognise that <span class="highlight">children</span> as well as adults have rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But always those rights are concerned with adults and not, as a rule, with <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There does not appear to me to be, as I will indicate later, the legal protection afforded to <span class="highlight">children</span> or the groups or individuals prepared to take up this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span>, by the very nature of their age and their lack of maturity, are not competent to protect themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All <span class="highlight">children</span>, without any exception whatsoever, shall be entitled to these rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span> have the same rights, I would assume, as any other person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is remarkable that no law concerning child cruelty was passed in the British Parliament until the Act of Parliament for the Prevention of Cruelty to <span class="highlight">Children</span> was passed in 1899. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That year a society was formed for the prevention of cruelty to <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It took the British society that long to recognise that cruelty against <span class="highlight">children</span> was as important as cruelty against animals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> are belted when they have insufficient English to understand staff instructions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span> are caned, or otherwise physically abused, for such faults as not being able to understand work, for not scoring above a certain mark in a test, for being late for school, for eating in class, for smiling during prayers . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But there is no group empowered to look after the interests of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I see it, the caning and strapping of school <span class="highlight">children</span> is an affront to human dignity; it is fundamentally unchristian; it is psychologically harmful; and it is educationally untenable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us look at the contrast of this case to what the law says about things being done to <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The conclusion she draws is simple: There is no mystery about why there is so much violence in the world, because that’s how <span class="highlight">children</span> are taught. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only last week the Swedish Parliament, by 259 votes to 6 votes, passed the first draft of a Bill forbidding totally corporal punishment of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, I believe is the beginning of what will be a move in our own country towards ensuring that the rights of <span class="highlight">children</span> are protected in the same way as the rights of adults are protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As 1979 is the International Year of the Child, I hope that it will not pass with a series of sanctimonious statements about the welfare of <span class="highlight">children</span>, but at least will result in concrete and positive steps being taken to protect the kids of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Furthermore, the clause extends over <span class="highlight">children</span> of the first generation who are not even born in Yugoslavia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In practical terms, this means that it is impossible for an immigrant from Yugoslavia or his <span class="highlight">children</span> to renounce their Yugoslav citizenship despite the fact that they become Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>They are also concerned that this very fact gives the Yugoslav Consular authorities in Australia power to haunt its dissidents beyond their terrestrial life, since this claim of citizenship extends beyond them to their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the ways in which we are able to assist those parents with <span class="highlight">children</span> who are handicapped and who have continuing expenditure is to review their financial circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me that this is of considerable benefit to parents who have this continuing expenditure because their <span class="highlight">children</span> have special dietary requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators may recall that in a Press release issued jointly by my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  on 2 March, 1978 it was announced that the Government was to establish an interdepartmental committee to investigate and recommend to Cabinet legislative or administrative changes necessary to reduce the incidence of <span class="highlight">children</span> being removed from Australia by one parent without the knowledge, or against the wishes of the other parent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the things that I raised during a hearing of an Estimates committee was that after that bombing the Government made funds available to shopkeepers or those people who had lost business because of the closing of the Hilton Arcade and a small fund was set up to provide for the education of <span class="highlight">children</span> of the parents who were killed in an explosion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The unemployment benefit always has been regarded as a temporary benefit whereas a person who is receiving a pension is either receiving that pension on the grounds of age for the rest of his lifetime, having reached the age at which he qualifies for the pension, or is a supporting parent or a widow or widower receiving it for a number of years while <span class="highlight">children</span> are regarded as dependants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am advised that the working party concluded that whilst there may well be a need in many areas for other <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services, such as neighbourhood centres which can provide a range of services including a minimal amount of full day care, the question to be decided by that committee was whether the Kindergarten Union could convert any of its pre-schools into full day care centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the Tribunal’s criticism of programs for <span class="highlight">children</span>, particularly educational programs, will the Minister be prepared to discuss with the Minister for Post and Telecommunications the appointment to the Tribunal of someone with special interest in the educational welfare of the younger generation of Australians before hearings for other licences in Australia take place? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, my hackles rise at some of the assertions made in it because they seem to me to be a follow-up to what has been a policy of gradualism in this Parliament over the past year to make the Australian people believe through several statements, Dorothy Dix questions and the like that even the air they and their <span class="highlight">children</span> breathe must be foul and polluted in the interests of a spurious, false and rather ignoble cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply make the point that to my mind this is a very important report because this happens to be the International Year of the Child and the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia are the most hard done by <span class="highlight">children</span> in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the light of the information in the Swedish pamphlet mentioned above- 200 million <span class="highlight">children</span> in the world who  never get a chance to learn to read, write or count; 500 million <span class="highlight">children</span> threatened with malnutrition- Australia’s population of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> is a small and manageable number. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those <span class="highlight">children</span> still need help- most of all the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> and particularly those who reside in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is about time, in May of 1979, the International Year of the Child, that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Senator Chaney)  gave information to the Senate about special projects being put forward to further the cause of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I address the Senate on the subject upon which I wish to speak, I want to say how pleased I am that  Senator Coleman  seems to have caught up with the health problems of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span> and how pleased I am that she referred to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs which dealt with this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to say, without wishing to diminish any concern that she may have raised about the health of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>, that the Senate should know that substantial funds are put into Aboriginal health in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those remarks were correct, except that I should state also that these amounts may be higher when there are dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790503_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These limits also may be increased if there are dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790503_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For example, for a long time there has been an important concern about <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790503_senate_31_s81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will provide more and better <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790503_senate_31_s81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to these standards, the Tribunal has stringent rules concerning advertising directed specifically to <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790503_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am concerned that <span class="highlight">children</span> with invisible handicaps such as dyslexia or specific learning difficulties be given sympathetic and professional assistance by special education programs within our schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the Australian Government’s attitude towards the identification and treatment of <span class="highlight">children</span> with specific learning difficulties? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, what were the circumstances which led to the Schools Commission innovation grants program earlier this year turning down a submission by the Specific Learning Difficulties Association of Australia in Adelaide which sought only $3,500 for a scheme which I believe was effectively arranged for assistance to <span class="highlight">children</span> suffering specific learning difficulties? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are all now obtaining a growing realisation of the wide range of <span class="highlight">children</span> with specific learning difficulties- not only dyslexia, aphasia and autism but also the less obvious difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, since they have been out in the open as a positive supplementary payment to wage and salary earners, pensioners and social security recipients with <span class="highlight">children</span>- a move which this side of the House supported- many Government back benchers, particularly people such as the honourable member for Moore  (Mr Hyde)  have been advocating cuts in these payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same time as looking at welfare expenditure I think we need to look at those other programs of government and talk of what has been able to be done in the matter of child care and <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services, services for handicapped people where the three-year program has given a much wider spread and improved service in our rehabilitation services, and in the very many excellent services which are conducted by the community groups, in some cases where we with State governments are jointly sharing projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The consultative committees to the interim committee of the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Commission varied from State to State but they were essentially concerned with making recommendations on the allocation of Commonwealth funds in the child care and preschool areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, the Commonwealth, through the <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services program in the Office of Child Care and acting on advice from committees and community groups, gives grants to facilitate the sharing of information through, for example, the funding of conferences and in other ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services program is now funding a number of projects concerned with child abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Projects funded in this way include telephone and personal counselling services, programs for mothers and <span class="highlight">children</span> at risk and a number of neighbourhood centres which provide facilities for crisis relief for parents under stress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Funds also have been provided to the States for the expansion of services to <span class="highlight">children</span> whose mothers are temporarily accommodated in women’s refuges, frequently because of domestic violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I state in respect of the comment of the  President  of the Australian College of Paediatrics that I hope his organisation, State governments and the Office of Child Care together will be able to do a great deal to assist <span class="highlight">children</span> in the ways the College may think important and in the ways which fit in with the Government’s program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the National Therapeutic Goods Committee recommend in November 1976 that the Government take immediate steps to ensure that drugs which have commonly proved dangerous to <span class="highlight">children</span> be packaged in childresistant containers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised by the Minister for Health that on the recommendation of the National Therapeutic Goods Committee he instructed his Department to prepare a draft ministerial order that would require the childresistant packaging of drugs known to be commonly implicated in the accidental poisoning of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not really able to state the reason for the disparity between the two rates that are paid in respect of <span class="highlight">children</span> of different ages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has his attention been drawn to the report of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal entitled ‘Television and <span class="highlight">Children</span>’ which indicated that a large percentage of <span class="highlight">children</span> had asked their parents to purchase items which they had seen advertised on television, that in the overwhelming majority of cases parents had bought the items advertised, and that the most popular advertising among <span class="highlight">children</span> related to food and confectionary items? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, has the Minister seen the report that the United States Federal Trade Commission has recommended that all television advertising aimed at <span class="highlight">children</span> under the age of eight be banned, and that all television advertising of presweetened and artificially sweetened products aimed at <span class="highlight">children</span> under the age of 12 be banned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In light of these findings and the reports of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts on advertising in <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs, will he ask the Minister for Post and Telecommunications to give urgent consideration to enforcing stricter guidelines for advertising during <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television programs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have found that my own <span class="highlight">children</span>, who watch mainly the Australian Broadcasting Commission, currently because of - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that in this letter the Victorian Refuge Group states that the original and continued funding of the refuge program was for more than emergency accommodation for women and <span class="highlight">children</span> at risk, and that in an attachment to the letter the refuge group declares that women’s refuges are ‘primarily concerned with the status of women in society and not with providing welfare and health services’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Community health program salary funds in relation to women ‘s refuges are intended solely for the employment of workers to undertake the care of women and <span class="highlight">children</span> in refuges and not for outside activities of any kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Mr President, I seek leave to table certain evidence taken by the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts during its inquiry into the impact of television on the development and learning behaviour of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I lay on the table of the Senate, volumes 3, 4 and 5 of the transcript of evidence taken by the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts during its inquiry into the impact of television on the development and learning behaviour of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the report itself, I believe that the inquiry into <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television has helped stimulate public debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This debate has ranged over the whole area of the effects of television on <span class="highlight">children</span> and, in particular, the effects of televised advertising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I think will be readily understood, these requests have come particularly from the United States of America, where there is also a widespread and growing public concern about televisions impact on <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have drawn attention to the alarming statistics relating to <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television viewing habits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Others have commended the concept of media education in schools which would be designed to train <span class="highlight">children</span> to be appreciative and critical viewers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- I rise briefly to endorse the remarks of  Senator Davidson,  the  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts, in respect of the transcripts which he has just tabled of the inquiry into the effects of television on <span class="highlight">children</span>’s learning and development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I endorse his expressed concern that all members of the Senate and, indeed, all members of the Parliament, should take note of the  material he has tabled today because undoubtedly the quality of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television has become an extremely topical and controversial issue in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt in my mind, as I think there can be no doubt in the minds of any of the members of the Committee, that there is widespread discontent throughout the community about the standard of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is widespread concern also about the effects of excessive television watching on <span class="highlight">children</span>’s learning and development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we feel that it is quite possible, without venturing into the area of censorship or undue government regulation, to take steps which will ensure that some of the concern about <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television viewing habits in Australia can be alleviated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given too the recent research report released by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal with regard to <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television, I support  Senator Davidson’s  request to the Government that action be taken immediately to consider and to act upon the recommendations of the Senate Committee’s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Button’s comments reflect the sort of concern which was expressed in the 1940s about the influence of  Boy’s Own  paper and such things on the attitudes of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The booklet will list all projects currently funded under the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Services Program, excluding vacation care and pre-school services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also anticipated that a supplementary booklet will be prepared following analysis of a census currently being conducted on the <span class="highlight">Children</span> ‘s Services Program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the wide range of prospective employing organisations (not necessarily confined to child care services funded under the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Services Program) the Department of Social Security is not in a position to make such projections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Community Health Program salary funds, in relation to women’s refuges, are intended solely for the employment of workers to undertake the care of women and <span class="highlight">children</span> in refuges, not for ‘outside’ activities of any kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In speaking about the appropriations for those two departments, I take the opportunity to refer to <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television and, more specifically, to the guidelines, which establish new requirements for <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television programs, which were announced by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal at the weekend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Tribunal, in its official documentation relating to this matter, pointed out that in its report on self-regulation for broadcasters it recommended that a new classification for <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television programs, namely, classification ‘C- the ‘C standing for childrenshould be instituted and that only material classified ‘C should be televised between the hours of 4 and 5 p.m. on week days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Later, at the end of last year, the Tribunal appointed the <span class="highlight">Children</span> ‘s Program Committee, which has now presented its initial statement and recommendation on these matters to the Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I imagine is now fairly well known because the matter has received considerable Press and media coverage, the requirements have been issued and from I July this year each commercial station, firstly, between the hours of 4 and 5 p.m., Monday to Friday, shall televise an aggregate each week of not less than three hours of programs which have been classified ‘C by the Tribunal’s <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Program Committee as material designed specifically for <span class="highlight">children</span> in the age range of 6 to 13 years and, secondly, prior to 4 p.m. each day, Monday to Friday, shall televise not less than 30 minutes of programs which are designed for <span class="highlight">children</span> of pre-school age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy President, you will recall that in November last year, in my capacity as  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts, I presented a report on the impact of television on the development and learning behaviour of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When tabling that report I pointed out the widespread use of television in the Australian home situation and its widespread relationship to <span class="highlight">children</span> and young people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span> were reported to watch television for about 20 hours a week, or nearly three hours a day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out to the Senate that concern about the impact of television on <span class="highlight">children</span> ranged widely over many issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effects of televised violence emerged as one of the major issues, but much concern was shown also about the effects of the constant exposure of <span class="highlight">children</span> to programs which portrayed male and female role stereotypes, unreal or foreign lifestyles and the gratuitous use of sex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the people who came to speak to us, we found that educationalists and parents were concerned that television was also adversely affecting the learning behaviour of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, some of them claimed that escapist material, watched mainly by <span class="highlight">children</span>, was stifling the development of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s creative instinct and imagination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the evidence which we received and from our analysis of programs, we concluded that much of the criticism directed at <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs offered by the national stations, but more particularly by the commercial services, was very well founded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That led us, I think very properly and very naturally, into a situation whereby we strongly recommended that <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programming should be taken out of the arena of industry economics and that programs should be produced by an independent production unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, we note with interest that the recommendations on <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs which were made to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal by the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Program Committee, to which I referred earlier, have been formulated into new requirements for each commercial television station and have been set out along the lines I have indicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those requirements provide, amongst other things, that from 1 July each commercial station shall broadcast between the hours of 4 and 5 p.m. an aggregate of not less than three hours of programs which have been classified ‘C for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ‘C classification system, which is outlined in the requirements set by the Tribunal, will go some way towards preventing the commercial stations avoiding the use of programs made specifically for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recommendations to the Tribunal by its <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Program Committee contain some interesting background material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our view, quality <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs must first be entertaining television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span>’s programs should fulfil some special need of childhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should be about subjects which interest <span class="highlight">children</span> and should be designed and presented in such a way that they can be readily understood and appreciated by <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that the Committee then goes on to equate television with <span class="highlight">children</span>’s literature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It observes that, just as quality <span class="highlight">children</span>’s literature contributes to the social, emotional and intellectual development of <span class="highlight">children</span>, so also should quality <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It makes a plea when it observes that the best <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs treat <span class="highlight">children</span> with the same respect that the best adult programs accord to adult audiences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It stresses that those who produce <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs should know much about <span class="highlight">children</span> and should like them, and that they should understand the individuality and diversity of <span class="highlight">children</span> and encourage that diversity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also supported the proposal for a moratorium period during which stations should be required to screen good quality <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been demonstrated from experience in other countries that <span class="highlight">children</span> will enjoy informative and educative programs in a  monoply  situation but will desert them in large numbers if other lighter and less demanding amusement material becomes available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any serious approach, therefore, to educating Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> in the appreciation of more constructive programming will need the co-operation of all stations in the screening of such material during prescribed <span class="highlight">children</span>’s viewing times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was one of our major recommendations-   a moratorium period as proposed by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, during which time all stations are required to screen good quality <span class="highlight">children</span> ‘s programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will ensure that three-fifths, or 60 per cent, of this viewing time will be devoted to giving <span class="highlight">children</span> a proper and suitable alternative to what today’s Melbourne  Age  has called imported, mindless cartoons and repeated screenings of programs originally made overseas for the adult evening market’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I would ask whether the 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. time slot is the best for the screening of these <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs and whether it maximises the child viewing audience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the material submitted to the Tribunal by the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Program Committee this was stressed as the best period, but  Mr Morgan,  speaking on behalf of the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations, did not agree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that more <span class="highlight">children</span> are watching television at 7 p.m. than between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether that is so, but I am tempted to say that it might well be related to the quality of programs in the afternoon and that very naturally <span class="highlight">children</span> will seek something that might hopefully be of a better standard and thus watch television at 7 p.m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have noted with interest the composition of the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Program Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. time slot is in my view, a good place to start and eventually should be extended to the period 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. After all, it should be noted that the period from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. is one during which a large number of <span class="highlight">children</span> watch television unattended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is definitely a <span class="highlight">children</span>’s time and therefore of particular importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, I would ask what sort of criteria will be used by the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Program Committee to determine what programs shall be accorded a C classification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pleasing also to note is the new requirement that prior to 4 p.m. each day commercial stations shall televise not less than 30 minutes of programs designed for <span class="highlight">children</span> of pre-school age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I am a little disappointed that apparently there has been no move to establish an independent <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television program production unit- to which I referred earlier- that would take the whole question out of the realm of industry economics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taken all in all, we believe that the document referred to, and the report of the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Program Committee to the Tribunal, are complementary to the kinds of thing that we have tried to say in our report to the Senate and in public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the weekend announcement is undoubtedly a promising start in improving the quality of <span class="highlight">children</span> ‘s television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need co-operation between the industry and the Tribunal to ensure that <span class="highlight">children</span> have the opportunity of viewing programs which reach a high standard of quality in terms of information and entertainment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have stated that we see our task as offering constructive assistance to stations and producers to enable them to work together to achieve entertaining <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs of excellent quality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore there is a call today for the public generally to require and to demand better standards in television programming and better quality in <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will watch with interest, and indeed with a great deal of hope, for the establishment of improved <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It improved Aboriginal health and it provided education for Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I assist and direct my <span class="highlight">children</span> towards their future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore ask: Has the United States Public Health Service Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices recommended the use of measles vaccine in <span class="highlight">children</span> exposed to natural infection up to 72 hours previously? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">children</span> in this study received vaccination at intervals, following exposure, of between one day and 14 days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A rapid onset of the fever reaction following vaccination in 12 exposed <span class="highlight">children</span> probably reflects a long interval after the initial exposure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One practical manifestation of that concern, of course, was the isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>’s education grant introduced by the last Federal Labor Government after Liberal-National Country Party governments had had 23 years in which to initiate such a move to overcome the financial disadvantages educationally of people living in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister for Education, by reminding the Senate of the many unemployed teachers in each State and of the difficulties that many isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> have with education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister consider an agreement with State governments to subsidise the employment of trained unemployed teachers who are willing to work as tutors or governesses in outback areas where small groups of <span class="highlight">children</span> are learning by correspondence? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>I remind honourable senators who seem to find this a surprising idea that a family on an average income, with three or four <span class="highlight">children</span>, going through a period of illness, will find having to pay for every visit to the general practitioner or every referral to a specialist, an intolerable burden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-6">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what do you do if you have got very sick <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 5 April 1979,  Senator Missen  asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Health, a question without notice  (Hansard,  pages 1359 and 1360) concerning the lead content of petrol and the effect of lead on the brain and central nervous system of young <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My question, which I direct to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, refers to a question I asked a month ago about the destruction of a number of copies of a report of the research unit of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal relating to <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications whether he is aware of the fact that television viewing is the dominant activity in the lives of many of Australia’s <span class="highlight">children</span>, absorbing as it does well over 1 ,000 hours a year which, in duration, outstrips both schooling and parental formation of their outlook? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the promised six months for governmental response to the Senate’s report ‘<span class="highlight">Children</span> and Television’ has expired, and given the tremendous support for that report’s recommendations throughout the community, especially in Tasmania, I ask: Will the Government urgently, before we rise for the winter recess, inform the Parliament of its response? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, how many individual <span class="highlight">children</span> are catered for at the Australian National University staff child care centre? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not able to give all the detail required by  Senator Walters,  but I am able to say that in the present quarter the average daily number of <span class="highlight">children</span> at the ANU preschool and child care centre is equivalent to 90 full time <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the licence is to cater for 80 <span class="highlight">children</span>, but the number of <span class="highlight">children</span> at the centre on any given day exceeds that number because of part time attendance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For <span class="highlight">children</span> over two years of age the cost is $34 a week, and for <span class="highlight">children</span> under two years of age the cost is $37.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply draw the attention of the Senate again to figures which show that as at the end of the last financial year the following losses have been incurred by families as a result of the failure of the Government to index or increase the family allowance payment: For a family with one child the loss has been $3.50 a week, for a family with two <span class="highlight">children</span>, $8.50 a week; for a family with three <span class="highlight">children</span>, $ 14.50; for a family with three <span class="highlight">children</span> with one student child, $14.50; and for a family with three <span class="highlight">children</span> with two student <span class="highlight">children</span>, $ 14.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge that there has been no increase in the rates that have been given to family allowance payments, but $ 1,000m is spent on family allowances in this country and a factor that is not recognised is that in the 1976 Budget this Government replaced the Hayden tax rebates for <span class="highlight">children</span> and child endowment with family allowances, and this initiative brought greatly increased assistance to some 300,000 families with 800,000 <span class="highlight">children</span> who did not benefit from the Hayden scheme of tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That additional number of the lowest income people who were not able to have the advantage of tax rebates-300,000 families and 800,000 <span class="highlight">children</span>- are now receiving substantial family allowances, whereas they were unable to take advantage of the tax rebates because of the level of their income in previous years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To return to the policy of the Australian Labor Party and the remarks of  Senator Keeffe,  I say that it is not right that Aborigines should be treated by them as some kind of <span class="highlight">children</span>, something that has to be protected or treated as a lower order of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has very weak ground on which to do so because in every instance it has supported the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  with the heart of stone, who has decided that the poor, the sick, the <span class="highlight">children</span> and the Aborigines of this country will suffer so that he can make up the deficit in the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last few weeks I have been aware of an area in Australia- I am not going to name itwhere many <span class="highlight">children</span> cannot co-ordinate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one has an hereditary head of state, one is really saying that access to decent living conditions, proper health care and a stimulating and full education for one’s <span class="highlight">children</span>, depends on the family into which one is born. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I explained the flag to the small <span class="highlight">children</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I may have lost some votes because I told the <span class="highlight">children</span> to ask their parents to take them out and show them the Southern Cross, and that night was a bitterly cold night in that part of Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>She was a vivacious girl who by her own effort and talent- not by virtue of the family into which she was born- had put herself in a position where she was working her heart out on behalf of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be regarded as informed speculation, on the basis of the very estimates which have been submitted to this chamber For its consideration at this moment, unless of course as a result of public opinion Princess Anne does what many consider to be the right thing and uses her own wealth and pays for her own visit here as World  President  of the Save the <span class="highlight">Children</span> Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggested early in May that some such course could be graciously and honourably taken by Princess Anne, thus freeing the $25,000 and enabling the Australian Government to make a direct gift to the Save the <span class="highlight">Children</span> Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A national family survey conducted by the University of New South Wales has shown that nearly 320,000 <span class="highlight">children</span> live in one-parent families, which families make up over 9 per cent of the nation’s families and a great majority of these <span class="highlight">children</span> are dependent on parents who receive social security pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that <span class="highlight">children</span> reliant on pensions from the Department of Veterans’ Affairs receive $10.50 a week plus an education allowance, will the Minister consider increasing <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowances to bring them all into line, and giving an education allowance to all <span class="highlight">children</span> dependent on pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the metropolitan area of Perth we have eight refuges which are specifically designated as women’s refuges, but I intend to show in figures which I will produce later that those refuges are used more for <span class="highlight">children</span> than they are for women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They counsel women and their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not suggesting that those doctors make a charge; I am simply commending the refuge for being able to obtain the services of a doctor, whether those services be provided free of charge or even for a small fee, for some of the battered wives and battered <span class="highlight">children</span> who have to attend or to use the services of a refuge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators that 1979 is the International Year of the Child and that <span class="highlight">children</span> are requiring the use of those refuges as much as women are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many more <span class="highlight">children</span> than women are in need of the services of the refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At one stage in Nardine the ratio of <span class="highlight">children</span> to women has 4.1:1, which I think is quite horrific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the Lucy Saw refuge in the four months between January and April this year 34 women and 59 <span class="highlight">children</span> were accommodated and five women and 1 4 <span class="highlight">children</span> were refused because of lack of accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Mary Smith refuge was able to take 35 women and 61 <span class="highlight">children</span>, but 126 women and 230 <span class="highlight">children</span> were turned away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Ave Maria refuge accommodated 82 <span class="highlight">children</span> and women in that same period, but it turned away 226 women and <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Warrawee managed to accommodate 76 women and 155 <span class="highlight">children</span>, but it turned down 56 women and 82 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Graceville accommodated 128 women and 222 <span class="highlight">children</span> in four months but had to refuse 1 18 women and 262 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Emmaus refuge- I will have a few words to say about this organisation lateraccepted 15 women and 28 <span class="highlight">children</span> but rejected 4 1 women and 82 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nardine catered for 78 women and 190 <span class="highlight">children</span> but was forced to turn away 32 women and 109 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, whilst accommodation was found at women’s refuges for a total of 1,163 women and <span class="highlight">children</span> over a four-month period more than that number, or a total of 1,383 people, were turned away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is not one refuge that would not be able to tell members of this place absolutely heartbreaking stories about women with <span class="highlight">children</span> who arrive in the middle of the night in battered physical condition and emotionally broken who are looking for some comfort, perhaps just a cup of tea and a shoulder to cry on to enable them to assess the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They receive the emotional assistance that is needed when a women with her <span class="highlight">children</span> are suddenly turned loose on society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen women who have had their teeth broken, who have had bruises around their face and shoulders and possibly over their bodies, whose <span class="highlight">children</span> have been battered and been taken to a refuge because it is a refuge for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Possibly because of its geographic situation in the metropolitan area it found itself catering for the needs of a great number of Aboriginal women with their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other agencies take Aboriginal women and <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation with Emmaus became quite drastic because finding emergency accommodation in Western Australia for a woman with <span class="highlight">children</span> who does not hold down a job is an extremely difficult proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a woman happens to be in a refuge, happens to be black and happens to have a number of <span class="highlight">children</span>, that woman becomes a long term resident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier this year I wrote to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Senator Chaney)  when I learned that one woman with five <span class="highlight">children</span> had occupied 158 bed days at the Emmaus refuge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing as homeless as a woman with <span class="highlight">children</span> who has decided in an area of crisis that she has to leave her home in the middle of the night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since we commenced operating we have had a very great demand for our service and at any one time we would average six women and fifteen <span class="highlight">children</span> accommodated at the refuge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The needs of <span class="highlight">children</span> in our refuge are not catered for as wc have no member of staff involved in helping these <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the International Year of the Child we hope the needs of the <span class="highlight">children</span> in our refuge can be met in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accommodation in general in Lismore is in a drastic plight, let alone for a single woman with <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is outright discrimination by real estate agents who prefer to rent to ‘families’ rather than single women with <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently, the staff of the refuge have had great difficulty in maintaining effective supervision of the women and <span class="highlight">children</span> and it seems that these problems resulted in the Theosophical Society notifying the organisation that its tenure had been withdrawn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This shows that the Government recognises the need for women’s refuges, recognises with alarm- as I think  Senator Coleman  put it- the increasing need for provision of such refuges in order to help people who are in distress, in danger or in terror, as well as <span class="highlight">children</span> who are subjected to what is widelyspread abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to child care, I agree that many of the <span class="highlight">children</span> who pass through these refuges, or are in contact with them, do need special assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The arrangements that have been made by the Office of Child Care, in regard to child care facilities, resources and programs for the assistance of refuges that are funded under the Community Health Program, will be of great benefit to <span class="highlight">children</span> who need to take refuge in the way that we have all described. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am hopeful that it will lead to improved care of <span class="highlight">children</span> and greater relief for mothers and the staff of the women’s refuges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators know that people react violently and cruelly, and that women and <span class="highlight">children</span> are not in a position to protect themselves against that sort of behaviour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even there, refuges that have accommodation for small groups of, say, six to eight women with their <span class="highlight">children</span> and which deal with people for short periods, have been accommodating up to 74 people over the last six months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have to advise women on their legal rights, their rights to pensions and allowances, what they can do about housing and schools and what they must do about the care of their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some funding is used to provide protective doors, fences, locks and windows because the police will not protect the refuges from men who want to fight and bash their way in to get back what they see as their property- their wives and <span class="highlight">children</span> who are inside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Coleman  is very concerned for the <span class="highlight">children</span> in these situations, I think she needs to know what went on at the Hobart refuge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was entirely in response to his concern for the <span class="highlight">children</span> in that shelter that the State Minister for Health made this order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said shelters are involved in caring for <span class="highlight">children</span> while the parent is at the shelter and there is a tremendous amount of follow-up work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What was wrong with increasing the expenditure on hospital services, on nursing home and domiciliary care service and benefits, on community health services and on health schemes for school <span class="highlight">children</span>, and doubling the amount of money spent from $ 12m to $24m? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If it is a fact, can the Minister say what basis is used for conducting existing programs for <span class="highlight">children</span> at risk in that area? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which I address to the Minister for Education, concerns a report in today’s  Australian  showing that Queensland school <span class="highlight">children</span> are the brightest in Australia and perform better in almost all categories of tests involving the traditional three Rs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government noted a report in last Monday’s Melbourne  Age  of what is said to be definitive research of the Harvard University research team covering more than 2,000 <span class="highlight">children</span> over three years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This report says that lead in the body, even in relatively low amounts, causes ‘mental deficits’ in young <span class="highlight">children</span>- specifically, lower IQs and more classroom behaviour problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, research has indicated that much lower lead levels may produce significant effects on the body, particularly on the nervous system and particularly with regard to developing <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The National Health and Medical Research Council assisted in the funding of research into the lead burden of Sydney school <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extent to which lead may be affecting <span class="highlight">children</span> is still under investigation and the statement remains open to debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am referring to people who have come to this country, overstayed their visas, come to certain domestic arrangements within Australia, such as having <span class="highlight">children</span> here, and then suddenly have been deported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The country stores in many areas made a rake-off out of this very small amount of wages because, even in those rare instances when an Aboriginal mother received child endowment, she would have to get the local policeman to collect her cheque and then perhaps he would give her a chit so that she could go to the store and buy food for her child or <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts gave attention to this situation in its report on <span class="highlight">children</span>’s  television? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the interesting sidelights of this matter is that the State Liberal member of parliament for the Townsville area,  Dr Norman  Scott- Young, who 10 or 12 years ago said that the explosion of French bombs in the Pacific would have no effect on the local people, changed his mind in quite recent years when he realised that there were a number of mutations and other unexplained mutilations in newborn <span class="highlight">children</span> in the Townsville region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This development has spread from carpets to upholstery, to protective clothing and to <span class="highlight">children</span>’s nightwear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the Minister representing the Minister for National Development seen the report of a two-year survey, headed by Professor L.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This question, insofar as it relates to a report, of which I am not aware, of a Professor Smythe concerning the level of lead in <span class="highlight">children</span> and others in New South Wales, would appear to be more appropriate for reference to the Minister for Health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We might have found that just as knowledge of Captain Cook perhaps does something for British <span class="highlight">children</span>, and knowledge of Burke and Wills might do something for Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>, knowledge of Columbus- and Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>’s knowledge that Columbus was Italianmight have done something to give Italian <span class="highlight">children</span> a greater feeling of belonging to the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That seems to suggest that the Commonwealth provides funds and the States allot those funds not on the basis of need- not on the basis of the areas in which <span class="highlight">children</span> who need this assistance to become properly educated are located- but on the basis of the total number which we can afford to help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also find in this second largest Greek speaking city in the world that those Greek parents who are concerned about their <span class="highlight">children</span> and who are concerned that they should retain their Language and their culture are asked to pay rent for the use of state school buildings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I as a parent- I suppose originally I came from some migrant background, but it is so far back that it plays little part in my life or the lives of my <span class="highlight">children</span>- resent the fact that my <span class="highlight">children</span> are growing up alongside <span class="highlight">children</span> whose background and culture could enrich their lives and my life if the Department of Education in Victoria and if the Federal Minister of Education  (Senator Carrick)  took a broader view of what we mean and what: we want when we say that we want education funded they make little effort to employ bilingual teachers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such programs may make some of the migrant people who have come to this country nostalgic for the country from which they came, but they would give their <span class="highlight">children</span> a very rough and ready idea of the country from which their parents came. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All the figures show a substantial difference, the most substantial being that of the single parent with two <span class="highlight">children</span>, where the difference between the poverty line and the pension payable is $27.38.I should have thought that the machinery motion which  Senator Chaney  has moved would be of great concern to the Government senators who, a year or so ago, were agitated to some extent- not to the extent of taking any drastic action- by the abolition of the promise made by the Fraser Opposition in 1975 and its effects on the recipients of pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is also a need for increased Commonwealth recurrent funding if the States are to be able to provide the extra remedial teachers so urgently required to improve careers counselling and to lower the size of classes in lower primary and infant classes, particularly in those areas where <span class="highlight">children</span> have special needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Other programs such as the program for migrant <span class="highlight">children</span>, the innovations program and the disadvantaged schools program are still very important but the Government has not been able to make any significant increases in respect of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>dealt with precisely the same matter being taken to litigation in the United States of America, where the parents of gifted <span class="highlight">children</span> are taking the school boards to court for denying their gifted <span class="highlight">children</span> the opportunity to excel within the ordinary State school system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He went on to indicate the complete lack of awareness within the Australian school system of the problems faced by the immigrant child and in one particular passage drew attention to the fact that <span class="highlight">children</span> in schools were being forcibly, one might say, educated in the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not unusual for such a family to sit at the dinner table with very little conversation between <span class="highlight">children</span> and parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet it has been the traditional role of the school to provide information, cultural and social awareness- which is very often absent in the home life of many students- and particularly some sort of integration into the Australian cultural ethos for those 39 per cent of <span class="highlight">children</span> for whom English is not the native tongue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was of assistance to those parents who were spending money on the education of their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is a cost to parents, if only in respect of the return foregone from their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is much more than the fact that the parents are missing out because the <span class="highlight">children</span> are not leaving school and not contributing to the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We tend to overlook the cost of housing, feeding and clothing <span class="highlight">children</span>, of providing those additional things that are required by schools, even paying the so-called school fees in state schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Topping up provided money for the area of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Out of the Karmel report came assistance to isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> and the encouragement to the States to do a lot more than they were doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps one of the most important areas was that of disadvantaged <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was fortunate to be involved with one of these schools in the early days when, at the Katherine School, it was found that the money which was available, even under the generous Federal funding, was not enough to meet the special needs of a group of <span class="highlight">children</span> at that school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that area we were able to take a group of <span class="highlight">children</span>, who were not achieving because of their deficiency in language, give them concentrated language training and equip them to move into the normal stream. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the time of the Labor Government much money was spent on Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>- not only in the communities and settlements and missions, as they were then known, but also in the community at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, we saw the introduction of the Aboriginal Secondary Education Grants scheme, bi-lingual education and a number of other projects which helped Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After a settling in period, it is fair to say, most States used the money wisely and were prepared to cooperate, and because the people in the State departments saw the needs of the <span class="highlight">children</span> they were able to clarify for the Federal Department of Education the needs in their areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the total analysis I suppose this does not matter; the <span class="highlight">children</span> got the advantages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They talk of low levels of literacy and numeracy and young <span class="highlight">children</span> not being prepared for employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The obvious reaction to this must be to suggest that schools do not prepare <span class="highlight">children</span> only for jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us fact it, it is not exactly a novel comment to say that schools are not preparing <span class="highlight">children</span> for the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Quality Education and the Individual Needs of <span class="highlight">Children</span> ‘ it states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But I think in the community unemployment is seen as a great problem, particularly by those who are unemployed or who have <span class="highlight">children</span> who are unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I recall to the Minister the speeches that were made by his great leaders in the 1 960s about the wealth of the country being our <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us recognise the Labor Government’s contribution in 1972-75, which has been applauded by all educators as showing the way with innovation programs, the programs for disadvantaged <span class="highlight">children</span> and the practices which grew out of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was opened in 1964 for these severely retarded <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">children</span> live in dormitories housing 25, 27 or 30 <span class="highlight">children</span> each. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was felt that because it was thought that the <span class="highlight">children</span> were mentally retarded they required no sort of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She found that there was no educational program for the <span class="highlight">children</span> and endeavoured to begin one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until the end of 1975 she was the only teacher there although there were nearly 200 <span class="highlight">children</span> in the establishment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">children</span> had lived all their lives there without any education program at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because there were so many <span class="highlight">children</span> to be fed by so few staff their food was mixed up into one bowl. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1977 a woman came to St Nicholas who felt that something else should be done for these <span class="highlight">children</span>, that there was a spark there, a recognition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She began a program designed to teach, to communicate and to stimulate these <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister of Education and the Minister of Special Education in Victoria were told of the program that was being conducted for the <span class="highlight">children</span> and of the advance they had made, but no action was taken, presumably because they were still quite sure that their original prediction that Anne was mentally retarded was right and that these people were fooling themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the hospital was nagged and because reports kept coming to it during this period, it agreed to purchase automatic page turners for the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In August 1977 the hospital agreed that an automatic page turner, costing $1,000, could be bought because at that time there were three <span class="highlight">children</span> at St Nicholas who were fully literate and seven more who were at the word recognition stage of literacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though the people in authority were saying that these <span class="highlight">children</span> were still retarded, they were prepared to put forward that argument when they agreed to buy a page turner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The device did not turn up at the hospital until February 1978, and it was then apparent to people that the <span class="highlight">children</span> would be unable to use the device unless they had remedial therapy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the authorities were not prepared to supply the remedial therapy to enable the <span class="highlight">children</span> to use the device. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They had agreed that $5,000 should be used to buy it but they were not prepared to admit that the <span class="highlight">children</span> could use it or were capable of using it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were not prepared to put the money into the remedial therapy that was needed to assist the <span class="highlight">children</span> to use the device. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So 13 <span class="highlight">children</span> who had built up their hopes and expectations of at last having a means of communicating with the outside world were sent back to the darkness of disappointment because the authorities were prepared to waste $5,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The authorities were prepared to disappoint the <span class="highlight">children</span> to that extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By this time other people outside the Mental Health Authority and outside this establishment had become interested in these <span class="highlight">children</span> and were impressed by them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The special education centre at Burwood State College had watched the <span class="highlight">children</span> work and had watched this particular child work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State College of Melbourne had watched the <span class="highlight">children</span> communicate and had communicated with them and it agreed that there was intelligence there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therapists and other people in the community also had watched and listened to the <span class="highlight">children</span> and had agreed that there was intelligence there and that something should be done about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing really was done about educating these <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who were concerned and who worked with them asked the State department for funds in order to give these <span class="highlight">children</span> proper education and a proper place to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Schools Commission was asked for funds from the innovations program to give these <span class="highlight">children</span> the education and the environment they needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They raised the matter of the future of St Nicholas Hospital, of its <span class="highlight">children</span> and of its education annexe and its staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">children</span> are now caught up entirely in the functions of the Health Authority and the Education Department has no word in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ministers were advised that education staff in the old building at Drummond Street, Carlton, which was formerly the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Hospital, were jeopardising their health and the safety of the students by carrying the <span class="highlight">children</span> frequently on a 16-step fire-escape which provided the only access between the dormitories and the education area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the annexe, five teachers and four full time and three part time teacher aides provide an educational service for <span class="highlight">children</span> who are multiple handicapped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need to lift the <span class="highlight">children</span> has caused four injuries to staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no equipment to accommodate these <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a time when only 55 of the 108 <span class="highlight">children</span> can receive any help from teaching staff, only 38  of them   participate in group ward programs and 17 receive any intensive programming, there appears to be prolonged procrastination between the Health, Public Works and Special Education Departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Presumably, that is outside Victoria-  <span class="highlight">children</span> moderately or severely handicapped arc regarded as a health or mental health responsibility- Victoria regards them as trainable and educable’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirteen <span class="highlight">children</span> who have spent their lifetime in that institution, who have now been proved to be educable, to be intelligent, and who are locked up in ridiculous bodies that will not work, have to put up with pious statements like that while Ministers and Premiers do nothing at all about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">children</span> were placed in these institutions when they were very young and they have never been reassessed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For years the parents of these <span class="highlight">children</span> were not brought into any programs because there were no programs to bring them into. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the last few years, as it has been proved little by little that the <span class="highlight">children</span> are able to be educated, the parents have been kept in the dark. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span> who have kept their sanity and their curiosity in that sort of sterile atmosphere for all that time would have to be very intelligent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of the authorities reacting with care, love, concern and some sense of excitement because these <span class="highlight">children</span> are not lost, there is a great future in front of them, and instead of the authorities supporting these parents by bringing them into the programs so that everyone can go on together, they are reacting in a most violent fashion as though they were keeping them prisoners, as though they were gaolers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because a move was started to show people that these <span class="highlight">children</span> are intelligent and should be taken out of the hospital, the authorities have tended to try to close up the place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was asked why I wanted to visit these <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When all that was done I was told that if the parents of the <span class="highlight">children</span>, some of whom were over 1 8 and had voted or were able to vote, agreed that I should visit, I would be allowed to visit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is needed is for governments to have enough imagination, enough will and enough love to realise that what these <span class="highlight">children</span> need is to be taken out of these institutions and to be put into separate premises where they have a home and a school, both of which they have never had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is needed is accommodation and facilities that will provide 24 hour physical care and provide an introduction to the activities of everyday life to <span class="highlight">children</span> who have been brought up all their lives in institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is needed are arrangements for the provision of physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy which is required to give the <span class="highlight">children</span> the maximum degree of control over their handicapping conditions; arrangements for educational programs to bring the <span class="highlight">children</span> to the level of learning of <span class="highlight">children</span> in their age group in the normal school system; arrangements to develop the technology needed to compensate for the <span class="highlight">children</span> ‘s handicaps. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have spoken of 12 <span class="highlight">children</span> who are my friends in an institution in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were 13 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems incredible to me that in an age when we can put men on the moon, when we can do extraordinarily difficult things, we cannot find a means of communication for these <span class="highlight">children</span>, for these people, for these adults. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, I wish to read from a report that was made on the <span class="highlight">children</span> at St Nicholas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Especially they do not agree when they are speaking about the schools that their <span class="highlight">children</span> attend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span> needing special assistance with remedial reading and remedial number work are less likely in Queensland to be receiving that help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With a teacher like that, if any of the <span class="highlight">children</span> succeed they will succeed probably in spite of the teacher rather than because of him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no real criticism of the teacher because he was doing his very best there under very trying conditions and in a very poor building, but the administration that allows that to happen should take steps to ensure that better educational facilities are provided for the <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what happened here is that it is was decided to pull down the school, to put up a temporary structure- which I will describe in a moment- to build the airstrip, then build the new school and move the <span class="highlight">children</span> from the temporary structure into the new school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how may <span class="highlight">children</span> per day is it estimated that a child centre in this building can accommodate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-64-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The plans for the proposed centre are designed to cater for a total of 53 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-64-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People think twice about improving their wages, getting their rightful wage and getting decent conditions of employment when a long line of people is waiting at the gate to take any jobs and when they have wives and <span class="highlight">children</span> at home to feed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Being able to sleep in a warm bed, eating three meals a day, having one’s <span class="highlight">children</span> educated and going to the doctor when one is ill are the sort of soft options with which this Government is doing away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no wonder that we cannot afford the unemployment benefit, health care, care of the aged and decent education for all <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To hand over to our <span class="highlight">children</span> a country with such a deficit as that would be completely irresponsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a sad little piece of Fraser Government symbolism that that is so in the context of the need to raise standards in poorer schools in this country to try to provide the greatest level of equality of opportunity for all <span class="highlight">children</span> wherever they live and from whatever socio-economic circumstances and backgrounds they come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is those absences from this statement which also give very cold comfort to, for example, students who are concerned about the levels of student allowances, academics who are concerned about the levels of research and their competence to compete in the international academic community, and parents throughout this country who are properly concerned about standards in schools and the sort of educational qualifications their <span class="highlight">children</span> will have in a society which makes increasing demands on them in terms of certification when obtaining apprenticeships and things of that kind, lt gets much harder every year for the ordinary product of Australian schools to get an apprenticeship because the standards become higher and higher and the demands on <span class="highlight">children</span> become greater and greater. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that that is a breach of trust to thousands of people, particularly those with <span class="highlight">children</span> at Catholic parish schools- not in the Level 6 variety- who are paying just as much tax as anybody else but who are paying an inordinate amount of their own incomes to subsidise the education of their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must also welcome the fact that the Government has been able to hold its line on disadvantaged schools, special education, disadvantaged country areas and <span class="highlight">children</span> in institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Health whether his attention has been drawn to the voluminous report on the incidence of lead in the air and its harmful effects on <span class="highlight">children</span> in Sydney arising from the growing use of petroleum products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, like that asked by  Senator Gietzelt,  relates to the serious effects that lead levels in petrol appear to be having on the health of Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister assure the Senate that in reaching taxation decisions in the forthcoming Budget the impact of these decisions on families, especially single income families with dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>, will fully be taken into account? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, should not tax be based on the principle of capacity to pay whereby the cost of supporting a dependent spouse and dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> should be taken into account? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A married scholar with two <span class="highlight">children</span> is also below the poverty line in spite of the important and responsible work he does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister was asked questions on this matter by <span class="highlight">children</span> at a breakfast party yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course he replied to the obvious criticism from the young <span class="highlight">children</span> and said that he would be prepared to allow his flying hotels to be used to bring refugees to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will also involve cultural, historical, ethnic, sporting, <span class="highlight">children</span>’s and youth organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-On 28 May,  Senator Tate  referred to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts entitled <span class="highlight">Children</span> and Television’ and sought information on the Government’s reaction to the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised by the Minister for Post and Telecommunications that he is well aware of the widespread community concern over the possible detrimental effects of television upon <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, he has publicly called upon stations and program makers for marked improvements in <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this Bill, the Government will be able either to cut out maternity leave and therefore make it impossible for married women to have a career in the Public Service and at the same time have <span class="highlight">children</span> or to redeploy or retire women because of their need for maternity leave or because they may need maternity leave, in much the same way as Ansett Airlines of Australia refused a woman the right to train as a pilot, even though she had all the qualifications, because she may need leave to have a baby and she may have a baby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can a woman be redeployed to another State or city and be expected to leave her husband or her <span class="highlight">children</span> in the State or city in which she is employed at the moment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I give the example of a man who has a wife and <span class="highlight">children</span> to keep and who is declared ‘in excess’ and therefore is to be redeployed or, at worst, retrenched; and of a woman in the same department whose husband has a good job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A male who has a wife and <span class="highlight">children</span> to keep at home and who is desperate to keep his job may declare that woman as the alternative person to be sacked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking into account the prejudices that people have in those areas and the fact that a man’s wages have to keep a wife, <span class="highlight">children</span> and himself, I think that sort of proposition would be accepted by those who have to make the decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suffice for me to point out that the type of facilities required by many <span class="highlight">children</span> who could be  elegible  under this scheme are not available in Geelong, but are in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the information provided it does seem that most <span class="highlight">children</span> in the area, and I guess throughout Victoria, are referred to specialists in Melbourne operating out of the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s and other hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As far as I know, the situation that prevailed in Victoria in relation to the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Hospital- which is where the large specialist centres are- was that once a patient was referred by his local general practitioner to the specialist, the line of communication precluded the general practitioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I forecast that in another five or six years we will not have enough hospital beds to take care of the sick <span class="highlight">children</span> whose parents will not be able to seek medical care for them because of the legislation that the Government is putting through the Parliament tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ever since government schools have existed parents- as I well know and most other parents who have had <span class="highlight">children</span> at government schools well know- have had their hands in their pockets for certain expenses in schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Australian Government has recognised the importance of this project by providing, I understand, $64m towards its success, and in view of the success of the scheme in drawing attention to the needs of <span class="highlight">children</span> in our modern society, will the Minister give favourable consideration to conducting a year of the Australian pioneer with the object of encouraging special projects for the aged in our community, a sector which is growing in number and creating great strain on organisations dedicated to providing facilities for these citizens who have done so much for the country during their lives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>MIGRANT <span class="highlight">CHILDREN</span> ‘MORE DETERMINED’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> are showing more determination than Australian students in staying on at school for good results despite a ‘hostile environment’, according to a Commonwealth Government report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It quotes questionnaire answers from ‘at least pockets of Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> with highly aggressive attitudes towards migrants’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report is the first to study over a period of years (1974-77) whether migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> from nonEnglishspeaking backgrounds tend to complete a full secondary school course, and whether they do well in their final examinations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It says that, in order to cope, the migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> may need to show ‘remarkable insight (that is, grasping clues to rewarded and punished behaviour) and immense selfcontrol and hard work’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this sample, <span class="highlight">children</span> with both parents born in a nonEnglishspeaking country are very heavily concentrated in: the lower intelligence quotient ( IQ ) scores (66 per cent, compared with 41 per cent of <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australian-born parents); in the lower socio-economic stratum (SES) group (79 per cent, compared with 55 per cent); and in the group of combined lower IQ and SES (55 per cent, compared with 25 per cent). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of those scores, the comparison for School Certificate and Higher School Certificate results between the total samples of <span class="highlight">children</span> of non-English-speaking and of Australian origin is very much in favour of the migrant <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Large numbers of <span class="highlight">children</span> from non-English-speaking ethnic groups cling to higher aspirations and stay at school despite a low level of performance as their school assesses it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general, when similar IQ and SES groups are compared, <span class="highlight">children</span> of non-English-speaking background did as well as or better than other students in School Certificate results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, with migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> comprising the larger part of the group in the low SES and with low IQ scores, migrants of low SES overall gained much poorer results than did other students of low SES. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again battling against this situation, educational aspirations in themselves played a bigger part in determining whether migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> remained at school to the HSC than did their IQ, their SES, or their SC results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, a substantially greater proportion of these <span class="highlight">children</span> continued through to the HSC than did Australian or other English-speaking students (41 per cent, compared with 30 and 35 percent respectively). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A greater proportion of the total number of migrant <span class="highlight">children</span> gained medium or high HSC results than did the Australian or other English-speaking-<span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it wants to encourage the education system (not only the high schools themselves) to serve <span class="highlight">children</span> characterised as of low IQ and low SES ‘whom it now does its best to throw off’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and explicit anti-migrant attitudes that appear to be entrenched in some schools, and to develop the capacity of all <span class="highlight">children</span> to benefit from living in an ethnically plural society- which we take to be the rationale for multicultural education’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Senator Mason asked me a question relating to reducing the level of lead in petrol and to the effect of lead on <span class="highlight">children</span>, as reported by Professor Smythe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, like that asked by  Senator Gietzelt,  relates to the serious effects that lead levels in petrol appear to be having on thehealth of Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter is very important because of the effect on the health of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obviously very important to the public whether they will have to pay 5c a litre more or lc a litre more for petrol that does not harm the health of as many as 20 per cent of all <span class="highlight">children</span> in our cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my State-  about 20 per cent of the <span class="highlight">children</span> were above this level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Dr Freeman’s statement said that 1 1.5 per cent of the <span class="highlight">children</span> tested had lead levels above the maximum recommended levels set. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This plea is made not only on behalf of the parents but also on behalf of the <span class="highlight">children</span> who need pre-school education, which <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That petition is circulating among concerned parents throughout South Australia and should be sufficient advance warning to the Government that South Australian parents are vitally concerned about its policy in regard to preschool <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Understaffing and long waiting lists of <span class="highlight">children</span> are becoming all too common. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By 1980 all <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia will have access to services designed to take care of their educational, emotional, physical, social and recreational needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What started in 1974 as a policy of providing pre-school education for all <span class="highlight">children</span> in the year prior to school entry is now rated as an area of the Budget worthy only of ‘topping up’ by Federal funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This represents a withdrawal of commitment, and subsequently money, which leaves the States, pre-school organisations and, most importantly, <span class="highlight">children</span> and their parents, stranded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In South Australia in 1 978 there were almost twice as many pre-school services as there had been in 1 974. with an equivalent increase in the numbers of <span class="highlight">children</span> using these services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If tuition fees have to be reintroduced this will preclude many <span class="highlight">children</span> from the benefits of pre-school education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the fact that a woman who recently went back to the United Kingdom with her five <span class="highlight">children</span> because she said she could not stand Australia has been backwards and forwards two or three times, it is interesting to note that authorities in Britain said that Australia House was very helpful in arranging for her and her family to be repatriated back to Australia when they had gone home to England before and then had wanted to return to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That further cutbacks in Commonwealth funding to State Schools and transferral of funds to wealthy independent schools as required under the guidelines to the Schools Commission announced by the Minister for Education in early June are of vital concern in that they mitigate against the interests of the great majority of Australian <span class="highlight">Children</span> in State Schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-2-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, refers to a ruling which we have been told comes from Canberra and affects the payment of family allowances to parents of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">children</span> are in homes on the fourteenth or fifteenth of a month the parent loses both payments for the full month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is to be no increase in that allowance, nor is there to be any increase in the amount paid for pensioners’ <span class="highlight">children</span>, which has not been increased since 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-84-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These poor people with <span class="highlight">children</span>, who are dependent on the Government for their incomes, have not had their <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowances increased since 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-84-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They also replaced the tax rebate for <span class="highlight">children</span>, which in any reasonable system of tax indexation would have been indexed since 1976 and certainly would have been increased since 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-84-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The allowances are extremely important to that group in the community who are not touched by our social security system- the working poor, the people on low incomes with a number of dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-84-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one adds to that group the pensioners with <span class="highlight">children</span> whose dependants’ allowances also have not been increased since 1975 one finds that those people in the community are being affected severely by inflation and by the failure of the Government to recognise that and to compensate them for the inflationary forces in our economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-84-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the area of the unemployed without dependants, in the area of low income earners with <span class="highlight">children</span>, in the area of the poorest of pensioners- those who have an income of $5 apart from their pension and live in rented accommodation- and in the area of Commonwealth employees compensation the Government has been as mean and miserly as it was in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-84-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know the proper philosophy that we ought to follow if we are going to spend millions of dollars, but I do know that we parents make an arbitrary judgment that at a certain time in their lives our <span class="highlight">children</span> are ready to learn about sex, about alcohol, about drugs, about road safety or whatever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The debate is taken up my maniacs from the League of Rights and from the Festival of Light and the <span class="highlight">children</span> are kept in blissful ignorance until they reach the age of puberty when we adults say to them: ‘There is this horrible drug problem out there’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That further cutbacks in Commonwealth funding to State Schools and transferral of funds to wealthy independent schools as required under the guidelines to the Schools Commission announced by the Minister for Education in early June are of vital concern in that they mitigate against the interests of the great majority of Australian <span class="highlight">Children</span> in State Schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Hayden  criticised the Government for failing to index some basic social welfare benefits, such as allowances paid for dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> of pensioners and the unemployment benefit for single people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All he says is that he will come up with the response to the unremitting neglect of pensioners’ dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If his response is to abandon the universal family allowance scheme, let us hear that from him so that the people can judge which payment they prefer to receive on behalf of the <span class="highlight">children</span> of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We estimate that some 56,000 supporting parent beneficiaries- this would cover about 96,000 <span class="highlight">children</span>- will now qualify for the pensioner health benefit cards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This should be of great assistance, particularly to those <span class="highlight">children</span> who are suffering from chronic or repeated illnesses in relation to which the burden of cost on the family is a very grave one indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Hayden did not choose to mention that the <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services program is playing an essential role in the support of low income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While we have maintained a commitment to pre-school education, we have directed this program towards creating a flexible network of services for more disadvantaged <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has doubled the assistance given to those families where <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services are vital and where family support services are required for the strength of the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has considered a national superannuation scheme, which was suggested in the Hancock report, and it has rejected the introduction of that scheme because it has recognised that it may place a very heavy burden on the lower and middle income families where the responsibility of raising <span class="highlight">children</span> already imposes heavy costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If it is difficult for <span class="highlight">children</span> in the city to manage on that sort of money, imagine what it is like for <span class="highlight">children</span> in country towns who have to go to the city for jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet the cost of country schooling will rise as a result of the petrol tax because it will mean that the cost of buses to take the country <span class="highlight">children</span> to school, the cost of the petrol which parents use to drive them to school, will be much increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I stress, as I and others have done in this place before, that if we plan to do anything for handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> education must start immediately after birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister will know from his experience, from his travels in the Northern Territory, that many of the teachers in the centre will be dealing with Aboriginal <span class="highlight">children</span>, so they can do with a lot of the help which that sort of centre can give. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they or their <span class="highlight">children</span> are ill frequently, as is often the case, those bills may be considerable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It will also affect the low income family, particularly the single income family and the large families with <span class="highlight">children</span> who frequently get ill and who frequently need prescriptions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should remember that the allowances for pensioners’ <span class="highlight">children</span> have not been increased since 1975, despite inflation, and family allowances have not been increased since 1976, despite inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These methods do not denigrate the unemployed but recognise the fact that the unemployed are amongst the most disadvantaged people in our community and need assistance in this area, lt is not beyond the resources of this country to conceive such a system and to provide a method of helping both <span class="highlight">children</span> and the unemployed to receive their pharmaceutical benefits in a similar way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ask it to withdraw this Bill, redraft it and, after consultation with its experts, provide a means whereby the unemployed, the large families, the people on supporting parents benefits in the first six months, the low income families and, particularly, families with <span class="highlight">children</span> can be identified in an equitable fashion as being disadvantaged so that they can receive the same sort of treatment as far as pharmaceutical benefits are concerned as the pensioners and single parents, after the first six months, get at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that all of us have come into contact, at some stage, with people who have been on a supporting parents benefit, especially mothers who have young <span class="highlight">children</span> and who have not been able to receive free pharmaceuticals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems so illogical because supporting parents obviously have young <span class="highlight">children</span> who at some stage will suffer some illness and will need medical care, yet up until now they have not been able to receive free pharmaceutical benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of current deficiencies in the Budget discriminate against people who are unemployed, people who have young <span class="highlight">children</span> and who depend upon allowances for <span class="highlight">children</span>, and people who depend on family allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Family allowances have remained unchanged, as have <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowances and the supplementary assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that amongst those classified as disadvantaged will be, for example, people with two or three <span class="highlight">children</span> who have chronic asthma on a continuing basis, because I believe that these people deserve help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we are not going to index family allowances, if we are not going to index allowances for <span class="highlight">children</span> of pensioners, if supplementary allowances are not going to be indexed, it is people like this, people who find it very hard to get by who are going to be the ones to suffer; people who tell us that they have two kiddies- both of secondary school age, by the look of it- and they sat down on Monday and Tuesday nights to have their dinner of 40c worth of bread and chips. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That further cutbacks in Commonwealth funding to State Schools and transferral of funds to wealthy independent schools as required under the guidelines to the Schools Commission announced by the Minister for Education in early June arc of vital concern in that they mitigate against the interests of the great majority of Australian <span class="highlight">Children</span> in State Schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was stung into putting this matter on the Notice Paper by my constant attendance- I am sure other honourable senators have shared this experience during the year- at various celebrations, competitions and events to mark the International Year of the Child- all very happy, all very superficial, and perhaps helping to foster a general apathy or complacency in the community about the state of our <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I want to demonstrate, the rights of our <span class="highlight">children</span> in various ways are by no means guaranteed by the sort of society we have operating in Australia at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whereas the need for such special safeguards has been stated in the Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child of 1924 and recognised in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the statutes of specialised agencies and international organisations concerned with the welfare of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope to take some areas from that Declaration of the Rights of the Child and describe practical concrete constructive steps which ought to be taken in order to secure some of those rights on behalf of these <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to secure their rights; they are inherent in them of course, but the most obvious fact about <span class="highlight">children</span> is their dependence on us as adults to create the sort of society in which they can grow to maturity as loving and mature human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am afraid that unless politicians and governments take some steps to leave a mark by way of concrete practical proposals on the statute book and administrative action, the whole year will evaporate in a series of sentimental happenings which leave no permanent imprint for the betterment of our <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are powerless, voiceless <span class="highlight">children</span> in our society who have been battered and sexually molested, and the community needs to bring this to its consciousness so that programs may be devised to deal with this tragic situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that that is only one instance of a general phenomenon in our society where violence is used against those who are the most defenceless and the most vulnerable- our <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps in Tasmania, with our smaller community, there may be fewer instances of battering of <span class="highlight">children</span> than occur in the large anonymous cities of the mainland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has emerged that in cases where a child is at risk of battery by the mother in particular all that is needed is a woman who herself bears some of the battle scars of bringing up a family- perhaps her <span class="highlight">children</span> have now grown up- and who has the time for the endless cups of tea needed to help the mother come to an understanding and to experience, perhaps, the love and affection from that older woman who bears the battle scars, so that the mother in turn can show some affection and love towards the child at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Based on his own experience and on projections of United States figures, he believes that probably 20,000 Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> are abused sexually each year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While protecting <span class="highlight">children</span> from physical abuse has become a priority in modern society, protecting them from sexual abuse is far from our collective conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the need to activate that collective consciousness that impels me to make mention of that particular abuse of <span class="highlight">children</span> tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can think- perhaps we have been blessed in our families- that this is not applicable to an affluent and easy going society like Australia and that those rights do not need to be fought for and secured on behalf of our <span class="highlight">children</span>; but, in fact, they do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As unemployment grows and as more male breadwinners find themselves trapped, as it were, back at home in a situation to which they are unaccustomed with small <span class="highlight">children</span> under their feet hour after hour- these people are low in self-esteem because of lack of employment and are frustrated- they will take out their frustrations on the small <span class="highlight">children</span> who are under their feet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not dwell on this matter except to say that what is worrying people around the community is, no doubt, the formation of the outlook of our <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Education is much wider than schooling, as we all know, and as I say the major formation of our <span class="highlight">children</span> is taking place perhaps in television studios, out of the control of school, parents, and other social influences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to reflect on that call for special legal protection of <span class="highlight">children</span> before as well as after birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps I could deal with the situation of small <span class="highlight">children</span> and youngsters in relation to the legal system itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But those regulations are not always honoured, and therefore I think it is incumbent upon Parliaments, by enactment, to ensure that <span class="highlight">children</span> are not questioned in circumstances such as I have outlined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall the incident some years ago when <span class="highlight">children</span> were born with multiple and gross deformities as a result of the mother taking a sedative, 1 think it was, which had been insufficiently tested by the major drug company which distributed it for sale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am trying to say is that at the moment, given the fact that the law does not provide for compensation for <span class="highlight">children</span> injured while within the womb, we have hundreds, perhaps thousands, of literally born losers coming into our community without receiving the financial compensation which might make their growing into maturity somewhat easier on their parents and families, who have to support them with their deformity or injury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who are the <span class="highlight">children</span> around the world without the protection of any government, effectively without any nationality, with no government willing to offer them protection and security- the ones most in need, having first claim to receive protection and relief? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that the answer lies in the stunted, malnourished <span class="highlight">children</span> of the refugee camps, whether they be in Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong or the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the emphasis in what I have said so far, in considering the <span class="highlight">children</span> in our own backyard, will not be misinterpreted as a selfish concern for our own <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It took a Dickens to alert the Englishspeaking world to the plight of <span class="highlight">children</span> in sweat shops, which he had had to endure while his father was in the debtors’ prison. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It took his pen, dipped in memories of his own experience, and his compassionate writings to alert the Englishspeaking world to the plight of those <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we need is another Dickens to arise and expose, as  Senator Puplick  has pointed out, the plight of those <span class="highlight">children</span> who are still in a situation of slavery in other cultures of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps that is not a bad thing really because who are we to preach to those other countries if we have not remedied situations in which <span class="highlight">children</span> effectively are deprived of their rights within Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thank God, that is not the total story and perhaps it is not the  story  at all in the case of many, if not most, of our Australian <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We need to leave a mark on our statute books, in our laws, in our administrative arrangements, in our very practicable, constructive, concrete encouragement of voluntary organisations, whereby the rights of <span class="highlight">children</span> as outlined in the United Nations Declaration are indeed secured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Tate in his remarks outlined for us in a very helpful way something of what flows from the ill treatment of, lack of consideration for, lack of love, care and affection for the world ‘s <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been some emphasis on a particular kind of child who is suffering from a range of disadvantages, but there are all kinds of <span class="highlight">children</span> in all parts of the world living in all classes of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He would not be surprised if all Australian governments- and maybe our own Government in particular- listed the kind of things that they were doing for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have dealt with the needs of isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> and with the needs of <span class="highlight">children</span> as far as television is concerned, and we are about to start on the needs of the child with regard to aspects of literacy and numeracy in his vocation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of us, whether we have <span class="highlight">children</span> or whether we do not have <span class="highlight">children</span>, have a responsibility to see that the next generation of our citizens have opportunities, the freedom to express themselves, the capacity to develop their talents and the opportunity to move into places which the preceding generation leaves so that all that is good in society may be carried on and expanded and all that is undesirable in society may be corrected and, if possible, eliminated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we look at the <span class="highlight">children</span> in our midst we know that by learning, whether it be in verbal or non-verbal languages, they will be able to develop their personalities and thereby make their later contributions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know also that as <span class="highlight">children</span> stand in our midst they are impressed and influenced by attitudes, values, opinions, skills and knowledge, but there is also the area that the child acquires from outside that circle- the agencies, the schools, the peer groups and the churches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is not surprising sometimes that our <span class="highlight">children</span> are attracted to and transfixed by a violent program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, we know from statistics that violence has a very heavy influence on <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this is a reflection of what is happening in our world, but there is no need whatsoever to put violence before <span class="highlight">children</span> at an age when we are endeavouring to encourage the development of their intellect, skill and appreciation, their sense of understanding, tolerance and forgiveness, and their companionship with other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Committee presented its report in relation to this and a whole range of other things concerning <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn briefly to the next area in which I have been involved, as  Chairman  of the Senate Committee, as far as <span class="highlight">children</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the needs of the isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Doubtless most of us think of an isolated child as someone who lives beyond the furthest fences in the great outback, in the great lonely distances of this country, but isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> are to be found in other circumstances also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are educationally isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> who live within an hour’s drive of this building. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are in all parts of this country <span class="highlight">children</span> who are isolated from one reason or another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was another exercise in which we took on board the needs of <span class="highlight">children</span> who did not have the access to educational, cultural and medical facilities of those who live in our urban areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our report has engendered a great deal of interest and concern by a very large section of the Australian community on behalf of those who are described as isolated <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although there are isolated <span class="highlight">children</span> in our urban areas, obviously and naturally our concern is concentrated upon such <span class="highlight">children</span> as live beyond the furthest fences, on the other side of the horizon as it were. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our report we highlighted the work that had been done in various ways on behalf of these <span class="highlight">children</span>- through the great traditions of the School of the Air, the development of satellite communication for educational purposes, the development of radio communication, the programs which provide living away from home allowances, and the programs concerned with second homes, the programs for upgrading the skills of governesses or teachers in isolated areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certain programs which have been initiated by the present government and by the former Labor Government have developed facilities for the benefit of the isolated child so that such <span class="highlight">children</span> not only may be educated, as we understand that word, but also possess an appreciation of society in all of its aspects, all of its needs and all of its opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As someone who has been connected with the National Library of Australia, I look forward to the time when library, information and related services will be available to all <span class="highlight">children</span> throughout the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second part of  Senator Tate’s  motion related to the suffering among the world’s 1.5 billion <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator’s remarks earlier would indicate that he was referring in this context to <span class="highlight">children</span> who lived outside of Australia and were in particular need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One who is involved in international aid inevitably becomes involved in the needs of refugee <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the 33,000 inhabitants, some two-thirds were younger people and they included, of course, a very large proportion of <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I moved through hospital centres, school room situations and a number of social situations, if I may call them that, where <span class="highlight">children</span> were very much in evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I saw worried me because I was concerned at what the future of these small <span class="highlight">children</span> might be, where they would go, what their memories would be, what influence this would have on their lives, their education and their attitude to mankind, the international world and to their fellows generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fortunately, the nutrition situation that I saw was catching up and <span class="highlight">children</span> were in reasonably good condition as far as these very unfortunate circumstances were concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motion which the honourable senator has put down tonight calls for our interest and responsible response in relation to the needs of <span class="highlight">children</span> in our own country and throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span> are, of course, one segment of a society which is made up of adults and older people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am too ashamed to talk about <span class="highlight">children</span> outside Australia such as <span class="highlight">children</span> in Africa who have been starved and enslaved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an Australian I am too ashamed to talk about <span class="highlight">children</span> in Kampuchea and India who have been starved and killed; about <span class="highlight">children</span> in South America who have been starved, enslaved, left without education and without hope; and about <span class="highlight">children</span> in East Timor who have been starved and killed and, I believe, abandoned by Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I bring to the attention of the Senate the life and the environment of a section of our three million <span class="highlight">children</span> who are under the age of 1 2 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of these <span class="highlight">children</span> have never lived at home with their parents, or, at best, they have lived there for a short time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the <span class="highlight">children</span> who in this rich, well ordered Australian community are born mentally or physically retarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of those <span class="highlight">children</span> were fortunate enough to go home to a warm, familiar surrounding with parents who battled valiantly to give them some sort of normal life, without any assistance by way of education, health care or relief from the overpowering 24 hours a day, seven days a week problems that they are faced with all their lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parents live in terror of their death because they do not know what is going to happen to those <span class="highlight">children</span> after that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of those parents, because of outside pressures, such as pressures of having no work and having other <span class="highlight">children</span> to look after, have had to let their <span class="highlight">children</span> go to institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have talked to some of those parents who are appalled and bewildered by what they have to abandon their <span class="highlight">children</span> to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are bewildered because those in authority- those people whom they see as being authorities- who should know, say to them: ‘Put your <span class="highlight">children</span> in this institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of your other responsibilities you must put your <span class="highlight">children</span> in this institution’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are appalled at the institution that they find is available in which to put their <span class="highlight">children</span> whom they bore, whom they love and regard as human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are institutions about which, at best, one can say keep those <span class="highlight">children</span> covered and warm and keep them fed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parents abandon their <span class="highlight">children</span> because they are told to do so by people whom they believe should know better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They abandon their <span class="highlight">children</span> to institutions that in many instances were built for adults in the nineteenth century and are still standing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are abandoned to institutions where one night nurse has to look after and be responsible for 36 <span class="highlight">children</span>, some of whom are quite incapable of moving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed there is one large institution in Melbourne in which helpless <span class="highlight">children</span> have been living since 1963. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some areas there are 30 centimetres between the beds and, I remind honourable senators, there is one nurse to look after 36 <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the sort of dignity that our <span class="highlight">children</span> are left with, that they are abandoned to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose one can say that in the sort of society in which we live today there is not much hope for bright <span class="highlight">children</span> who have gone through school, have passed their exams and have done well but who still do not have much of a future and will not have a job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have talked before about Anne MacDonald and a small group of <span class="highlight">children</span> at St Nicks, but there have been other <span class="highlight">children</span> at the hospital, <span class="highlight">children</span> who were not lucky enough to be close to Rose Crossley and were not lucky enough to have somebody draw them out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the interesting facts is that maybe many of these <span class="highlight">children</span> should not be in institutions at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Amongst <span class="highlight">children</span> who are mentally retarded is the group that most people know, mongoloid <span class="highlight">children</span>; <span class="highlight">children</span> who suffer from Down’s syndrome, <span class="highlight">children</span> who have been written off for years as being impossible to educate, impossible to use in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a doctor in Victoria, Graham CluniesRoss, of the Preston Institute of Technology, who has been working on a project to accelerate the development of Down’s syndrome infants and young <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Developmental progress data are reported on 36 Down ‘s syndrome infants and young <span class="highlight">children</span> who have been involved in an early educational intervention project for between 4 months and 2 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The development of all <span class="highlight">children</span> was accelerated, with achievements at and above normal levels being attained in several cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Younger <span class="highlight">children</span> were particularly advantaged by virtue of entering the project with higher developmental-quotient scores, and they progressed at least as rapidly (in some cases more rapidly) than older <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Included among the requisite components are: Commencing intervention as early as possible in the child ‘s life; involving parents in their child’s education; using a structured framework for curriculum design and teaching; formulating curriculum objectives around normal developmental sequences; conducting frequent criterion-referenced assessments of performance and using these data as a basis for decision making; having the program implemented by an integrated inter-disciplinary staff team: and providing follow-through programs for <span class="highlight">children</span> as they advance beyond early intervention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Down’s syndrome infants and <span class="highlight">children</span> conducted at the University of Washington. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Children</span> who have been in the project for up to five years are reported as having advanced to a level where they are achieving 95 per cent of the tasks expected of normal <span class="highlight">children</span> of similar chronological age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This contrasts sharply with the typical pattern of development in Down’s syndrome <span class="highlight">children</span> reared at home in apparently normal family circumstances but without the benefits of early educational intervention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is one area concerning mentally retarded <span class="highlight">children</span> that we have wiped off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is really depressing when one moves into the world of the <span class="highlight">children</span> in this twilight zone to find no government intervention, no government research programs, no government programs to search out answers to the problem of why these <span class="highlight">children</span> were put in this position in the first place, no government programs to assist them when we do find that they are in the position of being retarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government, through its Minister for Education, can ensure by means of specific purpose grants that education programs are commenced in these institutions so that the <span class="highlight">children</span> can give to the world what they have to give. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Back in 1977 there was a great outcry in Victoria about ‘ minus ‘ <span class="highlight">children</span>, the <span class="highlight">children</span> in institutions who were not as normal as other <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report, which was on the plight of Victoria ‘s mentally retarded <span class="highlight">children</span>, was prepared almost three years ago by a 12-member governmentappointed committee comprising doctors and specialists in social welfare and treatment of the handicapped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I took that to heart, and in this speech I have tried not to dwell on the purple prose, not to point out in emotive phrases the terrible life that <span class="highlight">children</span> in this area can live, but to give some evidence of the lives they live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The tears have to be turned into action, and this Government has to show solid plans to bring these <span class="highlight">children</span> into the real world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the argument that she was ashamed to speak with people abroad- I think I can paraphrase it in this waybecause of our lack of action in regard to <span class="highlight">children</span> in our own country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motion very clearly is expressed upon the basis that we should take practical, constructive steps in regard to our three million Australian <span class="highlight">children</span> and that we should be concerned with the 1 ,500 million <span class="highlight">children</span> throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will not be disagreeing with  Senator Melzer’s  view in regard to the <span class="highlight">children</span> in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know Miss Rosemary Crossley and admire the valiant effort she has made with the <span class="highlight">children</span> in the hospitals in Victoria about whom  Senator Melzer  spoke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that what  Senator Melzer  has said about the <span class="highlight">children</span> in these hospitals- she referred to the suffering and the ways of living and also to the unsatisfactory nature of the hospitals- to be accurate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that a number of these <span class="highlight">children</span> have intelligence and are, in fact, prisoners within their own bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But one would hope that what would rise above that would be the greater joy and pleasure of knowing that possibilities are being found for people like Anne MacDonald and the other <span class="highlight">children</span> in the hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel a necessity exists for breaking up the huge hospital complexes with large and unsatisfactory wards into small homelike facilities which have adequate staff and services, where education is possible and where the <span class="highlight">children</span> live as a family and do not have to be just one part of a huge mass. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to be prepared to spend quite a bit more money to ensure that these <span class="highlight">children</span>’s lives are real and that they are not allowed to just be vegetables all their lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Previously perhaps people took the view: What is the use of educating these <span class="highlight">children</span> because they will probably die before they reach 20 years of age? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has his attention been drawn to the report of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal entitled ‘Television and <span class="highlight">Children</span>’ which indicated that a large percentage of <span class="highlight">children</span> had asked their parents to purchase items which they had seen advertised on television, that in the overwhelming majority of cases parents had bought the items advertised, and that the most popular advertising among <span class="highlight">children</span> related to food and confectionery items? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, has the Minister seen the report that the United States Federal Trade Commission has recommended that all television advertising aimed at <span class="highlight">children</span> under the age of eight be banned, and that all television advertising of presweetened and artificially sweetened products aimed at <span class="highlight">children</span> under the age of 12 be banned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In light of these findings and the reports of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts on advertising in <span class="highlight">children</span>’s programs, will he ask the Minister for Post and Telecommunications to give urgent consideration to enforcing stricter guidelines for advertising during <span class="highlight">children</span>’s television programs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is presently considering the reports referred to, and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, which has responsibilities in the area of television advertising content, has advised that the advertising to <span class="highlight">children</span> of sugared food products is being examined by a working party ofthe National Health and Medical Research Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In deciding upon an appropriate course of action, the Tribunal will take into account the findings of the Council relating to the health aspects of the matter as well as advice from its own <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Program Committee and the views of the commercial station operators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The childrenininstitutions program referred to by  Senator Walters  is a segment of the Special Education Program of the Schools Commission, which makes funds available to government and nongovernment residential institutions for projects which support the education <span class="highlight">children</span> receive at school and at the same time provide opportunities for a broader program of experience outside the institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that a number of drug control authorities throughout the world have refused to endorse such a use of the drug and, specifically, that the Food and Drug Administration of the United States refused to endorse it after its attention had been drawn to the fact that the drug was associated with cancer, temporary or permanent involuntary chemical sterility and birth defects in <span class="highlight">children</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister for Social Security, who may recall that, on 2 1 August, I asked her a question in connection with the removal of the allowance paid to certain parents of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> in South Australia who had placed their <span class="highlight">children</span> temporarily- for less than a month- in a holiday rest home, the parents having been denied the payment for the full month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It needed some unravelling in the Department and action is being taken to overcome difficulties experienced by mothers of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span> who enter institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As much as we might dislike Vietnam and criticise its actions and its political philosophy, the key is Vietnam’s allowing the United Nations International <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Emergency Fund, the Red Cross and other aid agencies into Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Sydney this month the Barclay movie theatre withdrew some cigarette advertising when its program was for <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For your information and the information of other concerned people, we wish to use this occasion therefore to inform you why the Slovenes in Canberra have been forced to have two organisations, though the community itself is scarcely one thousand members strong (including <span class="highlight">children</span> and infants). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is no way in which it can be said that they are doing it for their own benefits, be those benefits for crippled <span class="highlight">children</span> or other groups for the worthiest of causes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is possibly very largely a State issue but at Echuca, which, as 1 have said, is on the border between New South Wales and Victoria, <span class="highlight">children</span> from New South Wales travel into Victoria to attend a certain school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that that situation of <span class="highlight">children</span> transferring largely from New South Wales, it would appear, into Victoria prevails right along the Murray River. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because something like 200 <span class="highlight">children</span> are being bussed across the Victorian border for technical education in the city of Echuca, the local school, the Victorian Department of Education, or whoever- I am not quite sure who- has had to issue an edict which virtually bans Victorian <span class="highlight">children</span> from access to the technical school there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Victorian parents are not prepared to call for black bans to stop free trade across the border, but they feel that they have a right and an entitlement, as citizens of Victoria, to have their <span class="highlight">children</span> get access to the only technical school facility that is available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the suggestions that have been put to me is that it may be feasible to have built in a hurry in Deniliquin a number of temporary school rooms which could be placed on site adjacent to the facility already in Echuca to allow all the <span class="highlight">children</span> of that region to obtain their education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government considers that in the circumstances currently prevailing in Kampuchea, there is no viable alternative to the well established and reputable international agencies, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, the United Nations International <span class="highlight">Children</span> ‘s Emergency Fund, the World Food Program and Oxfam, for the effective distribution of relief supplies to civilians in greatest need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to a joint International Committee of the Red CrossUnited Nations International <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Emergency Fund Press release of 26 September, the agreement provides for the presence of at least some representatives of both organisations to ensure that relief distribution is quick and consistent with the principles of impartiality and non-discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 ) Has the Minister received a submission from the Manly- Warringah <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Refuge Association requesting Federal Government assistance for the staffing of a <span class="highlight">Children</span> ‘s Refuge in the Manly- Warringah district. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What action has the Government taken to support the principle of Federal funding of such worthy community projects, especially in view of the New South Wales Government’s contribution of the land for the Manly- Warringah <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Refuge and the fact that a voluntary committee has raised $4 1 ,000 for the project in a period of 1 8 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-30">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the honourable senator who asked the question and all honourable senators will be aware that a good deal has been done already in the field of the relationship between <span class="highlight">children</span> and television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Davidson  chaired an inquiry into the effect of television on <span class="highlight">children</span> by the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That has had an important influence on the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and its <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Programs Committee and on the new arrangements affecting television programs for <span class="highlight">children</span> which were announced recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have to say that in my electorate there have been a number of cases in which <span class="highlight">children</span> have been taken by one spouse or by one partner in a dissolved relationship and that spouse or partner has left the country with the <span class="highlight">children</span> without any reference to the other spouse or former partner to the great distress of that person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There simply are not effective controls on the ability of people to remove <span class="highlight">children</span> from this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the parties involved simply took the <span class="highlight">children</span> and went to a country with which Australia has limited relations in respect of such matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has proved to be no way in which the interests of the person remaining in Australia and that person’s right to access to that person’s <span class="highlight">children</span> can be met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government has decided to introduce tough new measures aimed at preventing <span class="highlight">children</span> being removed from Australia by one parent without the knowledge or against the wishes of the other parent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has also decided that in appropriate cases it will grant financial assistance to assist parents instituting court action overseas to recover <span class="highlight">children</span> removed from Australia by the other parent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ministers said media reports had suggested that hundreds of <span class="highlight">children</span> may have been removed from Australia by one parent without the consent of the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we hope that when the new legislative and administrative measures are put into effect, the Government will both reduce the occurrence of the problem and assist in the recovery of <span class="highlight">children</span> who have been succesfully removed from Australia, ‘ the Ministers said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ministers said that the States would be asked to cooperate in making information on measures to prevent removal of <span class="highlight">children</span> from Australia available from magistrates ‘ courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until these measures had been implemented the Ministers suggested that people who suspected their <span class="highlight">children</span> may be removed from Australia by the other parent should consult a solicitor, or a registry of the Family Court of Australia, the Family Court of Western Australia or the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory for information on preventive measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The final matter to which I wish to refer is the examination of changes to reduce the incidence of <span class="highlight">children</span> being removed by one parent without the knowledge of the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What steps can be taken to ensure that all medication required by elderly or disabled people remains available to them in containers they can easily open- in other words, in foil or plastic bubble packs or in bottles with child-proof tops, all of which require a combination of strength and dexterity which not only <span class="highlight">children</span> but also old people often do not possess? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Yesterday Senator McLaren asked me a question concerning a letter from  Mr J.  S. McLachlan, Executive Director of the Mentally Retarded <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Society of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This relates to a request by the South Australian office of my Department to parents of some <span class="highlight">children</span> residing in four hostels run by the Society for a refund of a portion of the payments made to them under the Assistance for Isolated <span class="highlight">Children</span> Scheme, known as AIC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter of the level of allowances that had been paid for the <span class="highlight">children</span> in question first came to my Department’s attention as a result of an inquiry from the Auditor-General’s office in May of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That office was concerned that there might be a possible duplication between the AIC allowances and payment by the Department of Social Security of the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s benefit of $5 per day, that is, $35 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The common practice among institutions, when making out their accounts, is to deduct the amount of handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s benefit which they know they will receive from the Department of Social Security, and then bill the parents for the difference between this and the advertised boarding fee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as my Department currently understands the situation, the practice of these institutions has been to charge parents the full amount and then give them a refund after the handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s benefit has been paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Briefly, I indicated at that time that many migrants who are naturalised Australians, or in some cases their <span class="highlight">children</span> who are natural born Australians, may be regarded by their countries of birth, or of the parents’ birth, still to be citizens of those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When independent men and women are prepared to do without Christmas holidays for years, to see their bank savings totally eroded, virtually to starve and to allow their <span class="highlight">children</span> to suffer, surely we can say: Is there not a basic reason? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Quite apart from the fact that an employer might be quite prepared to pay a faithful employee so that he can keep his wife and <span class="highlight">children</span> off the starvation line while that industrial action is taking place, this Government has now seen fit to introduce this legislation to prevent a commissioner from allowing an employer to give his faithful employee any substance to live on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the present time the working party is addressing itself to such areas as patterns of television viewing by <span class="highlight">children</span>, the amount and nature of food advertising, patterns of food consumption in <span class="highlight">children</span>, nutritional and dental concerns relating to these patterns, and regulatory procedures in overseas countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is happening in a world where- again the figures are uncertain- it seems that at least 400 million <span class="highlight">children</span> go to bed hungry every night and where thousands of <span class="highlight">children</span> die every day through hunger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Senator Tate  suggested, this debate will provide the Government with a clear message: The Senate clearly believes that we must direct our attention increasingly to the question of arms expenditure and the need for disarmament in a world where hundreds of millions of people, particularly <span class="highlight">children</span> in this International Year of the Child, are undernourished and suffering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will recall that the current family allowance scheme brought increased assistance to some 300,000 families with 800,000 <span class="highlight">children</span> who, simply because of their low incomes did not benefit fully, or at all, from the previous system of tax rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These amounts are higher in the case of recipients of sheltered employment allowance and where there are <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as what we consider are sins of commission in the legislation, there are sins of omission in regard to the unemployed without dependants, the level of family allowances, the level of supplementary allowances for rental paid to pensioners and beneficiaries and the level of allowances to pensioners’ <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the updating of supplementary allowances and allowances for pensioners’ <span class="highlight">children</span> to compensate for inflation, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions in the Bill to which the Opposition has no objection are those which provide for twice-yearly indexation of pensions and benefits; those which provide an extension of income limits for pensioner fringe benefits; the extension of the wife’s pension to women in approved benevolent homes; the extension of the wife’s pension to women who are separated from their husbands because of illness or because they or their husbands are in benevolent homes; and the correction of the anomaly in the payment of family allowances and handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowances monthly which occurs when <span class="highlight">children</span> are in institutions or away for a holiday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-The first table demonstrates that the single income family in this country is below the poverty line on $ 140 a week with three or more <span class="highlight">children</span>; on $160 a week, with four or more <span class="highlight">children</span>; and on $ 1 80 a week, with five or more <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the pensioner earns $20 a week he is lifted above the poverty line by that extra income but, even with $20 a week more, the unemployed person with two <span class="highlight">children</span> or more remains in a poverty trap because of the low level of income allowed to the unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since it came to power in 1 975 the Government has not increased by one cent the allowance for pensioners’ <span class="highlight">children</span>, despite the fact that there has been a 40 per cent increase in the consumer price index since then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the initial benefit given to low income families by the introduction of family allowances in 1976, a family with three <span class="highlight">children</span> is $20 a month worse off and a family with five <span class="highlight">children</span> is $39 a month worse off in real terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance does not go to an institution, but absence of a child from home for a short period has debarred a parent from receiving that handicapped <span class="highlight">children</span>’s allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the interests of <span class="highlight">children</span> in Australia and around the world, particularly in developing countries, and as a matter of highest priority during the International Year of the Child, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-1-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question, which is addressed to the Minister for Social Security, by pointing out that Commonwealth support for the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Services Program is by subsidy to selected child care and family day care centres and has the effect of creating competition between subsidised and unsubsidised private child care centres which operate in the same region; further, that the Commonwealth subsidy is designed to assist disadvantaged <span class="highlight">children</span>, yet there are regions where only unsubsidised centres are situated, thus depriving disadvantaged <span class="highlight">children</span> in that region of access to assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Will the Minister give consideration to applying the subsidy directly to disadvantaged <span class="highlight">children</span> so that all such <span class="highlight">children</span> can have access to the centre of their choice? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Services Program does provide a range of services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter raised by the honourable senator would have to be subjected to examination by the Department and consideration by the Government in order to ascertain whether subsidies should be directly related to <span class="highlight">children</span> and not to services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that family allowances are a recognition that it costs money to bring up <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they are lucky, if they do not have a lot of <span class="highlight">children</span>, if they have a means of getting there and waiting around, they can go to a public hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One assumes that it means that people have been bringing <span class="highlight">children</span> into this country after adopting them in other countries under conditions and laws not acceptable under the laws of this country; when they have got the <span class="highlight">children</span> here they have been claiming a double orphan’s pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many people have actually brought <span class="highlight">children</span> in under their care as adopted <span class="highlight">children</span> and then claimed a double orphan’s pension when they have got here? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By adding this definition people who have adopted <span class="highlight">children</span> under the laws of other countries will be precluded from receiving the double orphans ‘ pension for that child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was felt necessary to add this definition so that when <span class="highlight">children</span> are adopted under the laws of other countries they would not be eligible for the double orphan’s pension when they come to live in Australia with their adoptive parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If she thinks that she should stay home and look after her <span class="highlight">children</span>- and we are assured by people such as  Senator Walters  that mothers should stay home and look after their <span class="highlight">children</span>- and she cannot pass the work test, she may qualify for special benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will go back to 1912 and not give assistance to women who are having <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think he answered his own question when he referred to the fact that special benefit may be applied for by a wife for herself and her <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She may also seek unemployment benefit to be paid for herself and her <span class="highlight">children</span> if that is the appropriate income security that she requires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They will get nothing for the duration of the strike; neither will their <span class="highlight">children</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Families of unemployed people with three or four <span class="highlight">children</span> and families of single parents with three or four <span class="highlight">children</span> are now almost $30 below the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They make the assumption that all good <span class="highlight">children</span> should live with their parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the updating of supplementary allowances and allowances for pensioners’ <span class="highlight">children</span> to compensate for inflation; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government does not do anything by the next election, every mother of five <span class="highlight">children</span> will be told by me and others that the Government has taken away $500 a year from her because it has failed to index family allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A mother of four <span class="highlight">children</span> will have lost approximately $400 a year; a mother of three <span class="highlight">children</span> approximately $270 a year; a mother of two <span class="highlight">children</span> approximately $160 a year and a mother of one child approximately $70 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paragraph (5), which seeks the updating of supplementary allowances and allowances for pensioners* <span class="highlight">children</span> to compensate for inflation, involves a cost of $26m in a full year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the putting down of an amendment provides a good opportunity to express to the Australian people what the policy is, how this compensation for erosion by inflation would be interpreted, and whether it would be interpreted to cover all families and all <span class="highlight">children</span> at a cost of $330m in a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A married man with two <span class="highlight">children</span> would have received, including family allowances, some 50.5 per cent of average weekly earnings at December 1978, compared with 48.4 per cent at the end of 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw attention to the fact that the figures for other family payments would show similar differences if the other allowances that are available to those with dependent <span class="highlight">children</span> were included in the table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have acknowledged that there are difficulties for many families with a number of dependent <span class="highlight">children</span>, who have an income either from social security or from one wage earner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that instance, I think we could be looking at the figures for a family with four <span class="highlight">children</span> on the table incorporated by  Senator Grimes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most of the 8,300 private overseas students have come from middle-class families who sacrifice about a third of their incomes to send their <span class="highlight">children</span> to university. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am not able to say what proportion of Australia’s cash grant of $750,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross, , the United Nations <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Fund and the World Food Program has already been used by these agencies for Kampuchean relief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government given any study to the Committee’s recommendations on advertising with emphasis on programs for pre-school age <span class="highlight">children</span>, the advertising of alcoholic beverages and the review of standards and their relation to the formulation of <span class="highlight">children</span>’s attitudes and values? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been referred to often in the Senate, and its recommendations on <span class="highlight">children</span> and television have been much debated by the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware of the warnings by  Dr Mark  Harris, a Sydney paediatrician attached to the environmental health group of the inner Sydney regional council for social development, that the concentration of carbon monoxide and other pollutants in the atmosphere in south-western and centra] Sydney was sufficient to exacerbate bronchia-pneumonic and respiratory complaints in <span class="highlight">children</span> and heart disease in adults. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just concentrating on the programs and services for families and <span class="highlight">children</span>, the Committee could have asked: Why do we not know who is receiving the benefits from the <span class="highlight">Children</span>’s Services Program or from family allowances? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-65">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How is it that at State level we cannot compare institutional with family foster care for <span class="highlight">children</span>, although the Commonwealth is extensively funding both? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-65">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the lone parents’ grants which were included in this program were incorporated into the <span class="highlight">children</span>’s services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-65">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Baume said that we do not really know how effective the expenditure on <span class="highlight">children</span> ‘s services or family allowances is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-65">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our relationship with neighbouring countries like Indonesia is, of course, important, but the sensitivities of the Indonesian Government should not be considered more important than the lives, the freedom, the self-determination and the health of the men, women and <span class="highlight">children</span> of East Timor who have been sorely abused for centuries by a neglectful colonial power, who have been abandoned in the wake of a revolutionary change in that colonial power and who were then taken over by a neighbour obsessed with unreal fears that a hostile power could develop amongst the 600,000-odd people on the edge of its own country of 1 30 million people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The dust is an alpha emitter and, in certain weather situations, would I think certainly reach the Jabiru township, which is now being built to house 10,000 people, including the womenfolk and <span class="highlight">children</span> of workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To achieve that, as I said before, I would rather see the money spent in helping to educate people- not only <span class="highlight">children</span> but all people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But I believe that we can help to change the attitudes of our younger people, our <span class="highlight">children</span>, through a program of education in the schoolsthe primary and secondary schools, even going on to the tertiary institutions- to impart a greater knowledge and understanding of other peoples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In answer to  Senator Sheil’s  specific objection I would say that in our imperfect society there is an unanswerable case for preventing organisations such as the League of Rights and all these other twisted people from, say, taking advertisements during <span class="highlight">children</span>’s hour on television saying: ‘You must hate Negroes, Jews, Muslims, Catholics or whatever’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we had a perfect society in which every mother and father had <span class="highlight">children</span> with whom they conversed and discussed these issues, surely we could have all sorts of garbage through the medium of television or propagated to them at any time, but we do not have that sort of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
