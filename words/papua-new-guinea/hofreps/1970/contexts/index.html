  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are consistent and not inconsistent as the Minister suggests, because if you believe in the early independence of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> you also believe in the early selection of members of the Administrator’s Executive Council as a step on the way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, believing in early independence for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, we do not want the Minister for External Territories to be choosing the inner ministry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>and (2) As stated by my predecessor in his answer of 29th September 1971 (Hansard, 29th September 1971, page 1710) the matter referred to is one which falls within the authority of the Assistant Ministerial Member for Local Government in the House of Assembly for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Electoral Ordinance a redistribution Committee must redistribute boundaries following a change in the composition of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is anxious that the amendments to the Papua and New Guinea Act contained in this Bill are made as soon as possible so that sufficient time will be available for the necessary redistribution action to be completed and in operation for the 1972 House of Assembly elections in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill seeks the approval of the Parliament to, the guarantee by the Commonwealth of $US23.2m or $A20.7m to be borrowed by the Administration of the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I point out is the vast amount of development work that still has to be done in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> if it is to reach any significant stage of industrial development or achieve any change from its basically subsistence economy in the years that are ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will have recourse to the other branch of the World Bank about which we talked recently, namely the International Development Association, which provides money at virtually no interest or for only a nominal service charge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have indicated, we do not oppose the measure; but I merely take the opportunity to point out the very high burden that the current interest rates on loans from this Bank place upon development in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill seeks the approval of the Commonwealth Parliament to guarantee the borrowing by the Administration of the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> of $20.7m from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The scheme was studied thoroughly by the World Bank, which sent a number of missions to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and it is obviously sound. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this scheme is a success it will make lt possible for the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to borrow money for further development from the World Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask honourable members: Why is it that we are to inflict on the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> the usurious interest rates involved in this legislation by the control that we place in the hands of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is it we are to inflict on the unfortunate consumers in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> the final costs of this loan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Hume has given his commendation to the Bill, but the Bill will inflict on the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> greater costs in the form of interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is equally true that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has great resources to permit the production of hydro-power, which ought to be exploited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In no way can this become a social objective in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why is it that we inflict these standards upon these people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How is it that we tolerate a situation in which we inflict upon the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> a rate of 7i per cent to 7i per cent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would advise honourable members to visit <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the next few months so that they may see what the last loan did in that country for posts and telegraphs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Up until a few months ago one could post a letter in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for 5c Despite the aberrations of this Government the rate in Australia has risen to only 6c. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when I visited Papua and New Guinea last week I found that the letter rate in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> had been raised to 7c. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this instance we have inflicted on the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> a heavy impost in the form of high telephone charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>High tariff charges for electricity will be inflicted upon the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I want to know is this: Why do we adopt this double standard in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told continually and plausibly by the economists and their apologists in government circles that we cannot raise the wage rates in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> because the economy will not support it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They say it might be all right to do this now when we give <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> a big subvention and therefore things are perhaps different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are doing, I believe, with this legislation is inflicting upon the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> a system which will prevent them from enjoying the full benefit of the electric power which would make a great difference to the standard of living of all the people there as well as to the production of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that this will be the last occasion on which we will allow the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to be mulcted in this way by the International Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder why we cannot allow <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to raise money on the Australian internal system in the same way as do local government authorities in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put to the Minister that this country is wealthy enough and that there is enough sympathetic support for the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for finance to be arranged , in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that it is iniquitous to inflict upon the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> the usurious loan that we are proposing at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last week we listened to the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Barnes)  not only introduce a Bill into this House but also make a statement of some significance and of some importance to honourable members and particularly to the indigenous people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Everyone knows that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been a subject of some contention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight, on the blue paper, provision is made for a cognate debate on a ministerial statement dealing with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the Papua and New Guinea Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Bill 1971 and the ministerial statement entitled <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>: Constitutional Development both arise from the report of the House of Assembly of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> wherein it recommended certain constitutional changes for its own country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes, however, that the country should now be divided into at least 100 constituencies, that they should be open electorates and that this would be a desirable form for the House of Assembly of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that the changed attitude of the House of Assembly on the prospects of earlier internal self-government than was originally anticipated is part of the fallout from the visit of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  and his party to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in January 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was quite pathetic that some of the most prominent expatriate figures in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> could go down to greet the mission sent by the United Nations, to thunder at it as if they could expunge the attitude of the outside world on the United Nations and stand there and say to the United Nations mission: ‘What has the United Nations done for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My sympathies have been with the first post-war Minister for External Territories,  Mr Ward,  then  Mr Hasluck  - as he was - and now the present Minister,  Mr Barnes,  in trying to make good the years that the locust has eaten in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will always thank God for  Sir Paul  Hasluck for one reason: Like prising barnacles off the bottom of a boat he prised the Returned Services League from its belief that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was a field for Australian soldier settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No focal point of loyalty exists in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He never aspired to powers that he saw in the Prime Minister because he has never seen a prime minister, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has never seen a prime minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the aspirations of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are very important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it seriously believed that if one went around the many villages of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and asked the people: ‘Do you think a Swiss cantonal form of government would solve the problems of Bougainville and the Gazelle Peninsula?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is taking place in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has far more resemblance to that, where you really have a total political spectrum of strong conservatives in some of the Ministerial Members while others are quite radical, taken right across the Parliament except for the Pangu Party, which virtually has made itself the opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Cabinet - if we can call it a Cabinet - that has so far been derived in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has resemblances to the Swiss system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, in the intial stages of independence, I think that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> needs a strong central figure to be a focal point of loyalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The excellent statement of the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Barnes)  recognises that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is moving rapidly towards self-government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement encourages this movement, giving it all the necessary support without seeking to determine <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s future for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was unfortunately the folly and irresponsibility of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam),  who was seen by countless people in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to be taking away with one hand without being prepared to give back anything with the other hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition went to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> with his heart and his mind closed to the people there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With as little understanding as he sometimes seems to have for his own Party and the people of Australia, he impressed on the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, in his colonial style, his own array of ideas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However much he may have been subsequently advised to moderate his stand since his first disastrous trip, the fact remains that Labor policy, as be stated it, was that, should the Labor Party be elected in 1972, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would be made self-governing, whatever the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> thought, whatever fear, division and hopelessness it caused there, and whatever harm it did to Australia’s long term relationships with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, of much greater importance is the fact that the Opposition’s policy has been rejected by the people’s representatives in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly, and it cannot be said that the members of that House acted hastily, without long and deep consideration of the issues or without evidence of all shades and intensity of feeling in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor can it be said that the House of Assembly was talked or pressured by the Australian Administration into its findings, for the plain fact of the matter is that the House of Assembly, of its own initiative, set up the Select Committee on Constitutional Development, which travelled widely in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, visiting other developing societies and hearing a great deal of evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that this recommendation, which the Government has accepted and which is so different in spirit from the policy of the Leader of the Opposition, is entirely the result of the free initiatives and the hard considerations of the people’s representatives of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extent of the distress which Labor policy has created is measured by a motion which passed through the House of Assembly by  36  votes to  11  and which stated that, if Labor won the next election in Australia and attempted to impose selfgovernment on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> without the consent of a majority of the people, the next House of Assembly should petition the United Nations to direct the Australian Government to act in accordance with the freely expressed will and desire of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, as guaranteed by the United Nations declaration on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples, and by the policy of the present Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we have the extraordinary and sorry spectacle of the Parliament in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> having to think of seeking the protection of the United Nations against the dictatorial policy of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s statement clearly recognises the tasks and difficulties confronting the Government and the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Administration and Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is widely understood that a particular problem facing <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is to find that system of government which can develop a sense of national identity while recognising and expressing the view of an immense diversity of local groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the Australian Senate is at present finding a new and vital role in Australian government, and it could be that the particular needs of the local communities in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> could well be met with the provision of an upper chamber which has built into it the local and regional factor - perhaps by way of election to the upper house via the local or regional scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> wants and we must continue to supply Australians of the highest skills and dedication. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to do much more to develop and to tap to idealism of Australians to serve both <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and our nation and to be prepared fully to reward and reassure those who accept this challenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He believes that the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are not quite ready yet for self government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition took hold of the tree of complacency in both <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia and shook it so that all those who were roosting in the boughs had to start to think for a change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that he contributed a great deal to awakening a new spirit in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is nonsense for the honourable members opposite to say that the Leader of the Opposition created derision, division and so on in the community of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that we do not want to underrate our achievements in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not taken enough steps in the field of the Public Service in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have bedevilled <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> with a double standard economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think that we have been unduly cautious on the political side in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not too sure about the future role of the Army in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But anybody with any eye to history or with any sense of what is going on in the world should be at least thoughtful or perhaps concerned about what the Army can do in a situation such as that in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My friend the honourable member for Fremantle has pointed out the difficulties of land ownership in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which we have not resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the problems probably is that the Army is much more richly endowed in so many ways, being directly a part of the Australian defence system, than other forces in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> such as the police, which are supplied from the Administration funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the real issue that we are discussing tonight is what kind of parliament we expect the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House of Assembly of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> faces tremendous problem of distance and of communication between the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another question facing us is whether it is necessary for there to be an established party system in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true, as my friend from Fremantle pointed out, that the Presidential system has been the one that looked most like the operations in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> over the last 25 years or so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that one of the unfortunate things that may occur at the next elections is that those members who are Ministers in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are the ones who are likely to become electoral casualties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In one queue there was a girl who, I would assume, came from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Somehow we, as a community here, have to come to a better arrangement with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a number of things that we should do for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> before it becomes fully independent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is our most important trusteeship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are those areas in which I think we have done quite well, but on the whole I believe that our good work has been bedevilled by an undue caution, by a failure to trust the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> adequately and by a failure to develop an effective Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome the statement by the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Barnes)  most sincerely for not only does it point out very clearly the outline of the future development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, but it also demonstrates for all of us to see the difference in approach between this Government and members of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opposition has consistently told the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>: ‘You will have independence in 1972 or early 1973 should Labor come into power at the next Federal election in Australia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the Opposition has taken no notice of the majority view expressed in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, except for tonight, that independence should be delayed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand the Government has consistently held the attitude that independence must be a matter of agreement between the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the Government of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I used the word ‘responsible’ in relation to Government policy with respect to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition has undertaken two quick trips to New Guinea over the past couple of years and in each case he has told those who attended the meetings that were held what a Labor Government would do with respect to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> regardless - I repeat regardless - of what the indigenous people wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, the Government has supported the formation of a Select Committee of Constitutional Development with members drawn, not from the ranks of Labor Press secretaries or ex-Australian trade union organisers, but from indigenous and expatriate members of the elected representatives of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>; people who live and work in the Territory; people who can speak the lan guage of the Territory and who, presumably, have some knowledge in depth of the customs and mores of the Territorians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it must be obvious to even the most obtuse of people that such a committee, with the membership it had, with the work it did, with the meetings it held, with the views it heard, would be in a better position to speak for the majority of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> than would a raiding party of Australian Labor Party theoreticians as exemplified by the recent visits to the Territory of the Leader of the Opposition and his minions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report and the recommendations make interesting reading because they reveal very clearly that at the moment the majority of people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> feel that internal self-government should come about no sooner than during the life of the 1976-1980 House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your Committee believes in the planned gradual development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for internal self-government, and believes that the attainment of internal self-government should merely be a further step in an orderly process of development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 note also in the constitutional recommendations of the Select Committee’s report that the system of government for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should be a single central government as at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is particularly so in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> because of communications difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problems which face the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are enormous - economic, administrative and political. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government, in its sympathetic approach to the move towards self-government - action taken in conjunction with the expressed wish of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> - must be congratulated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee believes that planned, gradual development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is needed before self-government takes place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last but not least, Australia’s image in Asia will be reflected in the way that Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> get on in the future in this process of development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A strong and efficient public service is essential if <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is to have meaningful selfgovernment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this statement outlines another stage in the remarkable progress towards selfgovernment and eventual independence for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I strongly support the Minister’s statement and congratulate the Government for doing its utmost to keep up with, and if possible one step ahead of, developoment in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and that is not an easy task. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Ray  Whitrod, the former Commissioner of Police in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, with all the benefits of police intelligence, warns that independence and self-government for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should not be delayed because of the worsening race relations there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am going to say quite bluntly that 1 think the Ministerial Member of Immigration, or the Minister for Immigration if he is to become that, in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should have the power of deportation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But for a long period <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has had a fairly high cut of different types of expatriates - missionaries, administrators and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I went right through <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> conducting discussions with all sort of leading Papuans and New Guineans and ordinary village folk, and there is not the slightest doubt in my mind - none whatever - that, in the high- lands, highland members of the House of Assembly have been put up to speak against self government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I said: Do you believe <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should now be controlling its own education?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I agree with the United Nations Mission, or some members of it, that there is far too much brain washing by expatriate interests suggesting that if <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is to have independence it has to have a lot of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are an awful lot of slogans flying around in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> because the people there are clutching at simple points of politics that they do not always understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not want a deterioration of Australian relations with the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> but as it is increasingly dawning on them that they will not own the economic resources of their country in minerals and other things they are becoming disturbed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the conditions of wage earners in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are thoroughly miserable and will remain miserable as long as the Toua Kapenas can leave trade union letters unanswered for over 9 months when they make a claim for wages, when the employers leave their letters unanswered and there is no system of arbitration which can bring the matter to an engagement to see what is really fair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is directed to the Prime Minister, arises out of the tragic news that reached us at the end of last week from the Gazelle Peninsula and the reminder in it of the intensity of feeling about Aboriginal claims for land rights - whether they are made in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> or here in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister for External Territories drawn his attention to a motion adopted by the House of Assembly of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> over 2 months ago requesting the Australian Government to send a Commonwealth parliamentary committee to Papua on a fact finding tour or has any request been made direct to him by the Parliament of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for such a visit? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will he, in view of the rapidly increasing tensions and rising pressures for self government and independence in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, make an immediate and favourable decision on the request and so enable members of this Parliament to be better informed on the aspirations of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of these, Peni and Bou were employed initially by Papuan Airlines Ltd and, since this company was taken over by the Ansett Organisation, have been employed as first officers on DC3 aircraft operated by Ansett Airlines of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The nature of TAA’s flying operations in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the standard of airmanship which these operations demand is such that a pilot must have basic qualifications and previous flying experinece in order to assimilate the advanced training which is required prior to qualification as an airline pilot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only exception to this rule of thumb for many years has been the 2 cadet pilot courses which TAA conducted during that time, but these are not regarded as being truly representative because the selection standards for the entrants was abnormally high and not suitable for application in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TAA is not equipped, either on the mainland or in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, to provide elementary and intermediate flight training, because it considers that the development of pilots within general aviation is of mutual benefit to both branches of the aviation industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This relationship already exists, in fact, in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the general aviation activities in the area do provide a suitable background for potential airline candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As part of its developmental role in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, TAA has a positive interest in promoting opportunities for young indigenes who are motivated towards a career in aviation and looks forward to the employment in the early future of indigene pilots who have gained the experience and qualifications necessary to enter airline flying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710826_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The right honourable gentleman will remember telling the House on 25 th August that he had not paid a visit to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for some time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also ask him when I may expect an answer from him to 2 questions about <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, one which he inherited from my putting it on the notice paper on 16th February and the other which I put on the notice paper on 17th of last month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable gentleman had been cautious enough to obtain information from the Department of Air as well as from the Department of the Navy he would have found that I visited <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on several occasions and not one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I went to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on several occasions as Minister for Air, flying in a VIP aircraft, which in those days was most unusual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Bowen) asked me a series of questions without notice on possible self-government for certain areas of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and I promised to obtain an early answer for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-35-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am informed by the Department of External Territories that the Report of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly Select Committee on Constitutional Development did indicate that there was support for self-government in the Bougainville and East New Britain Districts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-35-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Report also recommended that ‘the system of government for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> be a single central government as at present’ and that ‘internal selfgovernment should come about no sooner than during the life of the 1976-1980 House of Assembly’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-35-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has been announced that Area Authorities would be established in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the necessary legislation has been passed by the House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-35-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Have consultations taken place between Britain and Australia concerning the view of the United Nations Visiting Mission, 1971, that at some later date the people of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate might opt for unification with an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-35-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The full text of paragraph 465 of the Visiting Mission’s report which was presented to the U.N. Trusteeship Council, was: ‘The Mission shares the view expressed by the Select Committee that the vast majority of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> desire a strong central government and a united country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-35-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Bougainville, the present sense of separateness might be further diminished if at some later date the people of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate were to opt for unification with an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-35-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why has he not directed the attention of the Government to the motion passed by the House of Assembly for the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on 4th June 1971 requesting an early visit to Papua by a select committee of the Australian Parliament (Hansard, 25lh August 1971, page 670). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-35-52">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government facilitates the visits of members of Parliament to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to keep themselves informed of the situation there, lt will of course continue to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-35-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the things which were said by members of the Labor Party during defence debates and at other times prior to the last war about <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and threats of war are really quite incredible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister for External Territories been drawn to what was considered to be a strong attack last week by  Mr Johnson,  the Administrator of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, on racial discrimination in European dominated clubs in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He does not read of the near half of the world’s population which does not go to school or of the steady rise in world illiteracy; and as a result we still rely mainly on private schools in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I propose to deal with the area of my responsibility, which is <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This year’s Budget makes provision for Commonwealth aid of an economic nature to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> amounting to nearly $131m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This aid will enable the Government to meet Australia’s obligations for the economic development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has become fashionable to emphasise political development as Australia’s main task in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I became Minister eight years ago and paid my first visit to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> I concluded that we would have to do more towards economic development and do it quickly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I took the view then, as I do today, that if selfgovernment and independence were to mean anything at all to the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> they must not be too dependent economically on Australia and other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think, we gave a new direction to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s progress to nationhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Exports of copper concentrates from the huge Bougainville project will more than double <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s exports in 1973-74, the first full year of concentrate production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s economic infrastructure is being strengthened and expanded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the present stage of the telecommunications programme is completed in June next year, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should have a system that will cater for all traffic offering at that time and be a sound foundation for future growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Large scale foreign investment has been essential to the development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Everywhere I have been in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> I have heard the same plea for economic development - for more roads, new businesses, new crops to make rising standards of living possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without overseas investment there would not have been any modern economy for the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to participate in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In short, indigenous participation in economic as well as social and political aspects of the development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has increased significantly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result has been an increase in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s financial self-reliance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Internal revenue in 1971-72 will provide about 36 per cent of total Administration expenditure in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> compared with about 25 per cent in 1963-64. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From a country almost entirely dependent on a limited range of agricultural crops <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been transformed into a country which in the period 1965-66 to 1969-70 had a rate of growth of 10 per cent per annum for the whole of the economy - an achievement equalled by very few other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be the last to deny that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, like all developing countries, still faces many problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much of what we read about <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is clouded by pessimism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The speech which we have just heard from the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Barnes),  well presented and well delivered as it was, does not dispel from my mind the very serious doubt that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is still held in the minds of Australians as a colony and is treated as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had wished to speak on some constitutional questions in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can now discuss the points that I wanted to discuss about the constitution of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is one human problem in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which I think is urgent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things we should remember is that the number of employed people in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is a very small percentage of the population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great bulk of the population of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are self employed, growing their own food and so on, and this is rather fortunate for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been pointed out by research economists in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that Australian industry and affluent Australian agriculture in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are in fact subsidised out of the subsistence economy of the natives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that goes on, it will create a problem for the House of Assembly in the future if, when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> governs itself, it governs itself on those assumptions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second thing I want to say is that land is the vital question in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I want to say is that the problem in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is this local particular loyalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said this in the House before, and I fear we are doing the same thing in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no real corresponding structure in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, hence there is not the basic party structure unless it is artificially fostered in the House of Assembly of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is not that deep fundamental unity of nationalism in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the party system in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is entirely artificial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have some features of the Swiss system in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The modesty of the Swiss position might have been one of the best correctives for Africa, and it may well be one of the best correctives for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think that the classless society like <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> an all party Parliament or an all elements of opinion Parliament, with an elected Cabinet and an annual  President  might be the best system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Otherwise, the attempt to impose unity on them in the manner of conflict that we have been exhibiting may well be disastrous for the future of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I regard this as the most unctuous hypocricy because when World War II finished and the people of Australia, in a national sense, were conscious of the existence of the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> their attitude towards the Territory was in fact paternalistic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What was done by those people who broke the law would not be tolerated by their own government when they were independent and in command of their own destiny, be it in Bougainville, on the Gazelle Peninsula, in Port Moresby or in the highlands of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that the honourable member for North Sydney  (Mr Graham)  made a very relevant point when he referred to the fact that Australian banks have been established in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They own nothing and I think that that is in fact the crux of the problem facing us in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> today - our investment from outside and no national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am appalled at the apathy which exists in Australia and in the Government ranks about what we are doing to a nation entrusted to us by the United Nations to administer not only for the benefit of Australia but primarily for the benefit of the local population of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, to give them nationhood in a responsible manner and to allow that nation to take its place in the world community of nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us remember that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be our nearest foreign neighbour with an equal say in the world community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me quote from the House of Assembly debates of the Parliament of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from 1st March to 19th March 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was said in the Parliament of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in Australia would be speaking as  Mr Arek  spoke if the same decisions we are imposing on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> were being debated in the British House of Commons in relation to Australia, In defence of the perpetuation of these decisions we of course say that they are not ready and by some mysterious judgment of the wise man say that at some future, distant, undefined date they will be ready <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to  Mr Warren  Dutton, the member for North Fly when opening the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly ‘This system has saved the Australian Government more than $100m’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, when one considers that the Australian Government in 1969-70 spent $1,226 for every person in the Northern Territory and yet in the same year spent only $71 a person in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> one cannot wonder at the bitterness of the local people who see, rightly or wrongly, the white man enjoying a superior wage structure for the same work and winning positions in the Public Service ahead of local men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic education facilities in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are insufficient in quantity or quality to cater for all of the population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude has been to mould <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to a situation in which maximum profits flow to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One political party has even gone so far as to attempt to perpetuate the situation by sending a political organiser to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, $106,582,000 is allocated under Division 266 which relates only to the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I have looked at the Appropriation Bill and the legislation from front to back, I have found it impossible to find any expenditure associated with these Australian Government departments which is spent in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus we would be able to obtain information about the total amount of money which the Australian taxpayer sends to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> each year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The local budget for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, as submitted by the Administration, amounted to $197. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So for a number of years the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been running at an increasing deficiency, so far as income or revenue is concerned, and I appreciate that this position will continue for a considerable time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe there are 3 real dilemmas facing the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 note from the Budget itself that SI 30.7m is being allocated for specific proposals in the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and that, additionally, other expenditure is proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is quite a substantial sum and one would imagine that the Australian people would be pleased to think that this sort of grant in aid would be welcome to the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members examine the Hansard records of the House of Assembly of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> they will see great criticism of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is plenty of cheap labour in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want a unified <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has the numbers in the Gazelle Peninsula but he is not getting the numbers over the whole of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we cannot run a system in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> whereby, because there is a multitude of representatives from the Highlands, we are going to retard the development of all these other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am appalled as I sit in this place tonight and listen to the uninformed nonsense that is being spoken by some of the members of the Opposition - 5-minute visitors to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> who have no understanding and no knowledge of the position there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has done a tremendous job in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and its progressive development towards internal selfgovernment and independence with freely expressed wishes of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United Nations was critical early in the piece of Australia’s handling of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> because some of the nations represented on the committees that visited New Guinea were critical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recently interviewed in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> a number of local government councillors and when one expatriate who was a teaching sister on one of the councils suggested that the difference in payment was a big problem and could cause jealousy between the expatriates and the indigines, several members of the council got up and said: How foolish can you be? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the great problems in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is that there are so many ethnic groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no question that most of the trouble in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in recent years has been aggravated, as was mentioned earlier, by the visits of some irresponsible members of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members do not believe this, let them go to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and talk to the New Guinea people themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are tremendous projects being developed in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fisheries have a great potential in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and, of course, there is mining at Bougainville. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to be inherent in human nature that people want to own land and the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> also want to own land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a great problem with roads and highways and the transport system in a country with a terrain like <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A tremendous job has been done in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> over the years by cooperation between the New Guinea people and the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to Australia for many reasons that they remain our friends and that we remain the friends of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 also wish to say a few words on the appropriation for the Department of External Territories, particularly as it affects <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having recently visited <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after an absence of 8 years I expected to see great change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, unfortunately my impression of the greatest change was the dramatic growth in racialism and I left the Territory very concerned about Australia’s future relations with it, as I believe it is of paramount importance, not only to this generation but also to the future generations of Australians that a sound and friendly relationship and understanding of the problems of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia should be forged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The head of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Administrator’s Department,  Mr T.  W. Ellis, was crawling around the House of Assembly floor on all fours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a dearth of students with secondary education to fill th positions required by the necessary step-up in localisation in commerce, industry, the public service and the teaching profession, not to mention the need for undergraduates at both the University of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the Technological Institute at Lae. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also believe this Federal Government should have an early look at the question of the border of Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, because it should be remembered that the nearest island owned by Queensland is only approximately 2 miles from Papua. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very clear from the tenor of the previous speeches made in this debate that the speed of the move to self-government is a continuing theme in any discussion of the estimates, or the matters relating to the estimates, of the Department of External Territories and in particular of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it does seem to me, in listening to a succession of speakers, that they do the cause of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s self-government and independence some disservice in their highly selective criticism of what is in fact happening there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is strange then that our Government members committee, for example, when it went to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> last March, found an almost total absence of the supposedly widespread criticism accorded the population there by, for example, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith  (Mr Lionel Bowen). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we cannot leave it at the fact that there is a useful clan system - and this has been so for some centuries - in operation in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said that the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> can - and they say they can - run their own community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So just let us qualify a little this apparently universal capacity of Papua New Guineans to run their own show in the face of international overtures, competition and international desire for investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in saying that one has to bear in mind that there are considerable reservations expressed by the people of the permanent overseas service in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The writing has been on the wall in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for quite some time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have not suddenly found a <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> equivalent of Kenya or some African State coming under other ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who would wish on the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> or an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> with a couple of million people, having a substantial problem with large areas of land differentially occupied in terms of population density and even in land use, a 3-tier system of government which half the speeches in this House deal with as being a major problem of national operation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there should be very great circumspection exercised in any possibility or contemplation in a serious vein of introducing a formalised and to that extent, once implemented, a relatively inflexible third or middle tier of government in so young a territory as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that one of the major problems in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is that not enough of the leadership in the House of Assembly or in the local government councils has made a conscious, intelligent commitment to create national unity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not underestimate how difficult the creation of national unity, of a genuine sentiment of national unity, is in a country like <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most disturbing thing about <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is that there does not appear to have been among enough leaders - if among any leaders - a conscious decision that the goal of their life is to create a united <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor do I draw false analogies between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the difficulties of national unity in some African countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that there would be any conflict on a very large scale in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> because the tribal units are not large enough - if the people reverted to tribal loyalties - to carry out war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The things that seem to me to threaten unity in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are relatively few. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said many times that I am extremely critical of the wage structure in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is probable that there are not many more than 100,000 in what we could call a wage or salary sector of the economy in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, even throwing in plantation labour, and in a large population of 2.5 million there are very many more people who are living in a traditionalsubsistence economy and who are not affected by the level of wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been extremely fortunate in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that although these places have developed there as badly as in almost anywhere else in the Pacific, the people who have come to dwell in shanty towns have come in tribal units and the tribe can sit with a pretty severe discipline on the young people of the group which has moved in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been somebody in the shanty towns responsible for the behaviour of younger people and there has not been to the same extent as there has been in other areas of the Pacific the breakdown of tribal disciplinary sanctions among shanty dwellers in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was alarmed to get correspondence from missionaries in the Bougainville area whom I respect speaking about the position of migrant workers who have been taken from other parts of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to work for construction companies which have been carrying out construction ancilliary to the development of the mining areas there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is pretty well known in this House that people who originally said many years ago - and did not say it as a Black Power slogan either, but as a genuine conviction - ‘black is beautiful’, are the people of Buka and Bougainville, who are the blackest people in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and have the habit of calling the browner people of other areas ‘red men’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had some difficulty regarding itself as part of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>during the course of his speech tonight mentioned that he believed that the lack of educational opportunities in the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was not important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately the extent and depth of educational services in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are as yet insufficient to meet the potential demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the Second World War the great bulk of educational opportunity in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was provided by voluntary mission schools and was essentially limited to primary schooling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alan Randall’s ‘Reorganisation of Education in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’ covers this quite clearly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second is to ensure that the dual system which we have adopted, which we cherish and which we have fought for in our own country is offered to the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the great problems of education in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is simply to get education to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the honourable member wants - I think that I am right in my interpretation of what he had to say - is to ensure that the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> have a freedom of choice, that is, that they can send their children either to a State school or to a non-State school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what we are pointing out is that we have not extended education opportunities throughout the whole of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Personally,  1  thought that the achievement of uniformity, if we can call it that, between the  2  systems in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was an achievement of some magnitude and that the living together of church schools and Administration schools or State schools - call them what we will - was an achievement of great social importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the important thing about education in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is that there are so many people who still are getting none at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I wish to say first of all is that I hope that all Australians are starting to realise how important is our work in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, we are creating in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, if this is the term which we should apply to this social and political exercise in which we are engaged, a nation of some international significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that in all our relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> we realise that this is the case, and that every step that we take which produces negative results can be fraught with danger and difficulty for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If any step produces positive results in our relations with the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, no matter what is its cost it is well worth while. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House of Assembly is the Parliament of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it - and the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Barnes)  will correct me if I am wrong - earlier in the year a resolution was passed by the House of Assembly in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> asking for a committee of this Parliament to visit Papua, I think it was, to have discussions on the grounds - let me put it that way - of some of the problems associated with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My next point is this: What are our relations to be with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as a race apart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the long run we will not be able to treat the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> differently from the people of New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the British Solomons, Tonga and all the rest - all the people associated with the South Pacific Commission, for instance - are people with whom we have to find a new relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While there are 2 million people in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> the population in other places is relatively small - 100,000 here, 20,000 somewhere else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why I am disappointed that our relationship as a Parliament with the Parliament of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been so peripheral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could do something about the exploitation of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by the Australian airlines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian airlines charge nearly twice as much in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as they do here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He denigrates our economic development in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How on earth could it then have found millions to develop <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has amazing attitudes towards the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Government formulated this wage structure it was based on the primary products of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> - copra, cocoa, coffee and similar products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The wage in the agricultural sector of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are higher than in any similar country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members examine the wage structures in the newly independent African countries they will see that those countries have not improved their wages, but <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has to compete against those countries on the world markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will defend to the last drop of my blood our policies on the wage structure in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad that the honourable member appreciated it, because if the honourable member for KingsfordSmith had not said that he had visited <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> 1 would have concluded that he had gained his information from the mass media. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was quite extraordinary because I do not think the honourable member would get any of the local people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to agree with him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing that they treasure is the form of law and order that Australia has introduced to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the honourable member that until a few years ago in many parts of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> a man would be born and would live his whole life in one place, never moving more than about 5 or 6 miles from it because if he did he would be murdered in another tribal area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today they can move from one end of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These few Australians brought law and order and government to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government has been to give a representative House of Assembly to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House of Assembly has been elected by the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to express their views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is trying to bring democracy to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> but the Labor Party has said that the views of the people should be disregarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How could the Government appoint an all-party committee when the Opposition has shown such disregard for democratic principles in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having recently visited <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after an absence of 8 years I expected to see great change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can he obtain from the Ministerial Member for Education in the House of Assembly the number of children in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter referred to is one which falls within the authority of the Ministerial Member for Education in the House of Assembly for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-12">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter referred to is one which falls within the authority of the Assistant Ministerial Member for Transport in the House of Assembly for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How many (a) resident and (b) non resident companies in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> have taxable incomes in excess of $100,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter referred to is one which falls within the authority of the Assistant Ministerial Member for the Treasury in the House of Assembly for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of these 63 (86 per cent) are classified as residents of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> while 10 are classified as non-residents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>: Use of Military Forces in Times of Domestic Violence (Question No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since my predecessor’s statement in the House of Representatives on 16th March, consideration has continued of the procedures for the employment of elements of the Defence Force in aid of the civil power in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, should this become necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Supreme Court of the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> already has such a procedure and it is working well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let Us take the case of some of my friends from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> or from India - people whose resemblance to and affinity with us are almost absolute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So what I am asking is this: Will somebody tell me why a person who has as much affinity with us as has one of our friends from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is more different from us than is the person who has come from, say, Turkey and is different from us in every regard? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic decision is that the Australian School of Pacific Administration - ASOPA - should supplement training and undertake specially structured training which cannot be better or more conveniently provided in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> or elsewhere in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its new role ASOPA will concentrate on administrative and specialised training to prepare Papuan and New Guinean public servants for accelerated advancement within the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will work very closely with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Administrative College. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will provide supporting segments of middle and advanced management training courses conducted by the Administrative College, additional sessions of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> executive development scheme to qualify local officers for advancement to and within the Second Division of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service - equivalent to Commonwealth Third Division - and specialised ad hoc courses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To enable the School to take on its new role of training Papuans and New Guineans, most of the existing training activities for both <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the Northern Territory will be relocated as soon as practicable or phased out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent years the main role of the School has been in training teachers for service in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will be making arrangements to continue the teacher training of Australians for service in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the Northern Territory now undertaken at ASOPA. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Arrangements are now in hand for new teacher trainees for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to commence their training at the Canberra College of Advanced Education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Principal of the Administrative College of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been added to the Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dr S.  S. Richardson, C.B.E., Principal of the Canberra College of Advanced Education, and  Mr A.  Tololo, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Teaching Service Commissioner, have agreed to be appointed to the reconstituted Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has had a long and creditable history in the training of Australians for government service in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and, of more recent years, for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s decision to use the resources of ASOPA to supplement training which can be provided to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is one which I am sure will commend itself to honourable members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the years the School has built up experience and specialisation in the affairs of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the South Pacific and I am sure that it will readily adapt to its new role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that all Australians will do all they can to see that the experience Papuans and New Guineans gain through living, studying and training in the Australian community will not only improve their skills for the well being of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, but will also develop the bonds of personal friendships between Papuans and New Guineans and Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Australia has done a lot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the field of political development we have done very little in the Northern Territory compared with what we have achieved in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to certain recommendations made by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly Select Committee on Constitutional Development and agreed to by that House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Select Committee on Constitutional Development was set up by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly on 24th June 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its task was to draft a set of constitutional proposals as a guide for future constitutional development in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The territory would be then known as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 5 of the Bill provides that the Territory of Papua and the Territory of New Guinea shall be together described in the Act, and in other laws and instruments, as ‘<span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’ rather than theTerritory of Papua and New Guinea’ and other amendments also effect this change of name. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inclusion of non-elected nominated members in the House is a new concept in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> but there is a widespread feeling in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> of the need to provide a means for the representations of special groups, for example, women, or persons having a special expertise, in the legislature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To qualify for appointment as a nominated member, a person must have lived in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for not less than 5 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Likewise publication of notices in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government ‘Gazette’ could be ineffective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendments contained in this Bill give legislative effect to the request by the House of Assembly for changes in the constitutional framework for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Approximately 97 per cent of the land area in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is held by the indigenous persons oi communities by virtue of rights of a proprietary or possessory kind which belong to individuals or communities and arise from and are regulated by native custom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-35-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our aid to Indonesia during the 3-year period 1971-73 will be $54m, which amounts to 40 per cent of our overseas aid, excluding aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Works Review’ section of the report the point is made that a considerable amount of work was done not only in Australia but also in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in 1970 the controversial Public Order Ordinance was passed by the House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matters referred to fall within the authority of the Assistant Ministerial Member for Lands, Surveys and Mines in the House of Assembly for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-52-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Administration has given no financial assistance to clubs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-52-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not possible without contacting every club in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to state which clubs have not admitted Papuans and New Guineans as members, though it is known that many clubs do not have them as members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-52-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matter referred to is one which falls within the authority of the Assistant Ministerial Member for Lands and Surveys in the House of Assembly for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-52-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However finance can be arranged through bodies such as the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Development Bank and the Housing Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-52-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Among the beneficiaries under this legislation are some of the Australian breweries whose export trade is not going to what normally we would regard as an overseas country; it is going to the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In one sense Australian trade going to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should not be regarded as being very much different from trade crossing the Murray River. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that in years ahead <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will become somewhat different from the Murray River area - I do not deny that proposition - but nevertheless I am sure that when this legislation was introduced it was never intended to aid sales of beer from Australia to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as we know from our own economic history, the brewing industry is one of the industries that a country can best encompass for itself, and there is such an industry in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 do not argue about the relative merits of one kind of brew compared with another, but t suggest that as far as the future welfare of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is concerned, if it is to have a local brewing industry I am not too sure that there should not be some barriers set against the import of the product from outside <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At one stage we had intended to move an amendment which provided that the legislation ought not to apply to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, bt,/ perhaps in general terms that might have been a bit sweeping. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urged upon British Ministers the need for the EEC to adopt measures to ensure that the exports of tropical produce from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are in a no less favourable position than those from other developing countries which are to receive special treatment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is still a trust territory, the British are hopeful for early progress towards agreement on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave - In my recent statement to the House on my overseas visit, I mentioned the representations which 1 made in London on the problems for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> arising from British entry to the European Economic Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am now pleased to be able to inform the House about the successful conclusion of negotiations on behalf of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The British Government has accepted an offer from the Six under which exports originating in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be able to enter the United Kingdom until 1st January 1978, under the conditions which apply at the time of British accession to the Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In making these arrangements for the Territory, the Community has stressed the exceptional features of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> position both from the point of view of its international status and from that of its economic strength. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accepting the offer by the Six, the British Government expressed its confidence that the Community would make reasonable arrangements for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the context of any review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am sure the House will join with me in expressing appreciation for the special efforts made by the European Economic Community to recognise and provide for the unique needs of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition welcomes the statement, lt would have been helpful if the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  had given us some indication of what this would specifically mean to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in terms of value of trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The treatment of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in this matter is perhaps not exceptional. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this respect the position of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is parallel with a good many tropical African countries and with the West Indies but that rights of entry have been extended to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is very welcome, lt could be that in the future an expansion of trade will develop between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the EEC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one step which will help to make an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> viable in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Moreton knows, for example, that on the Equator on Los Negros or Mantis Island many members of the Royal Australian Navy are making very significant sacrifices under- very difficult conditions and that Australian servicemen are stationed in Darwin, elsewhere in the Northern Territory, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Singapore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for External Territories, ls he aware that the present educational system in the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is such as would enable the cargo cult to open a school and qualify for financial aid? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While recognising that the Christian churches have made a commendable, selfmotivated contribution in the past in the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> does the Minister foresee the danger of this policy leading to the creation of an intolerant nation divided on religious differences? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would point out to him that the full authority for primary and secondary education in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> resides with the House of Assembly and the Administrator’s Executive Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Section 23a provides for an exemption from tax of 20 per cent of the income derived from the production or sale of prescribed metals or minerals mined in Australia or <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this is a serious abdication of our responsibility to the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought to place a stopper immediately upon any further alienation and transfer of leasehold land in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to anybody other than the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian judges have been invited to accept situations in Cyprus, Tonga and Nauru and, when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> achieves independence, they will undoubtedly be asked in many cases and for some years to accept appointments there, too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At its latest Federal Conference, in Launceston last June, my Party declared that it would second and support skilled personnel requested by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and other islands of the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not believe that what is evolving in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is an ideal constitution but most of the proposals which the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Barnes)  has put before us are proposals which the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly accepted from the Select Committee on Constitutional Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a good gesture if we were to give to the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> an adequate Parliament House as a gift from the people of Australia, because the present Parliament House is most inadequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Besides, this one has in it a second chamber, and we do not want to suggest the establishment of a second chamber in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is crippled by the absence of an adequate national library and adequate national archives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Leader of the Opposition has been very much criticised for some of the things that he said in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, I would like to suggest that some of his criticisms of some of the subordinate courts in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> were thoroughly confirmed later by the Supreme Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I feel is the most necessary thing in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is some effort at indoctrination - it is an ugly word - in national unity, because national unity in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is just not growing like Topsy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one of the paradoxes of the history of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that when  Mr Ward  was the Minister for External Territories he used to be attacked by the ‘Pacific Islands Monthly’ for trying to establish in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> what Robinson of the ‘Pacific Islands Monthly* called  Mr Ward’s  socialist empire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The curious thing about <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and  Mr Ward’s  government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was that  Mr Ward  governed entirely on military plans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the war when ANGAU - the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit of the Australian Army - was established in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> it set up a research body in Sydney which became ASOPA, the Australian School of Pacific Administration, to look at the problems of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as a nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But historically, as a fact, only about 40,000 a year was spent on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The impact of the Japanese invasion changed all that, and the military had to look at the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as a nation whose support was to be won for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the post-war period,  Mr Chifley  indicated to  Mr Ward  that  Colonel Murray,  who had been the  Chairman  of the research section of ASOPA, should be made the Governor of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the plans that had been evolved should be put into operation in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Swiftly Australia’s expenditure in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> rose to 3m, which was about 75 times as much as to was pre-war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the point about it was that it was the first time that any significant authorities in Australia had looked at the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as a nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am disturbed at the fact that today the most conscious effort to develop national unity in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is still coming from the military. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an intelligent effort to imbue it with a sentiment of allegiance to the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the the House of Assembly and to the Administrator’s Executive Council and their successors in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have noted quite a deal of criticism of the Army from personalities in the Administration whenever 1 have been in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, but 1 would say that the Administration in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should make an equal effort to indoctrinate the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the sentiments of national unity because <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in its whole historical background is not a nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose one can say that the  Deputy Chairman  of the Administrator’s Executive Council is the nearest approach to a Prime Minister that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has yet had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The powers in the Swiss Parliament; power to choose the Ministers and a close identity of the Ministers with the House, offer security against the emergence of dictators in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not feel that at the present time the House of Assembly in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> can have the luxury of the kind of acrimonius divisions we have in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it cannot be endured where national unity is precarious - the attachment of Bougainville or the attachment of the Gazelle Peninsula to the whole of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is so insecure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The gleeful process of scoring off Oscar Tammur which takes place in the House of Assembly from time to time may be regarded by us as the normal to and fro of party politics, but in my view it is seriously weakening the attachment of the people of the Gazelle Peninsula to remaining within <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the antithesis of a conscious effort to build national unity in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The military aim at unity within the military framework, and 1 would like to see the Administration strive for the same unity in the civil structure of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> - the House, local government, the civil service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had no doubt that that was the case in the Administrative College but I was not equally sure that that was the case with some of the staff of the University of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In any event, it is unwise to do anything to play off any elements of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> against the others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They may be conservative relative to some of the people from the coastal plain, but actually nobody in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is what I would call socially conservative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When  1  was first elected to this Parliament, 26 years ago, very large parts of the map of the highlands of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> were simply blank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the main, in the past <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has had a very good cross section of expatriates in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the great companies of Australia, Burns Philp in particular, had a past in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>  and  right throughout the Pacific that was extremely harsh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think that the reality of the powers of the Minister for Immigration in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> may answer this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One great advantage the Army has, and one that the Army exercised quite ruthlessly, was the power to ensure that any Australian officer or non-commissioned officer who was a morally harmful or arrogant element, an exacerbating element, an abrasive element - and there were some of them in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>; some of them helped to produce mutinies - was promptly put on the next plane south. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are people in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> who ought to be on the next plane south, and the native people will tell you so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not let us disguise from ourselves that this provokes jealousies, lt is inevitable that if you bring in to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, for instance, an excellent standard of housing for expatriate civil servants the mere presence of the building constitutes a new idea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The native people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> made very beautiful houses out of indigenous materials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is a great tendency on the part of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to refer to these as’ bushy’ and ‘Kanaka’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a great deal of criticism of the Army by the civil administration in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> because its standard of housing is high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment will help democracy in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to be more able. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In rising to support this Bill I would first like to point out that the purpose of the Bill is to give effect to certain recommendations made by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly Select Committee on Constitutional Development and agreed to by the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provision is made to change the name from the Territory of Papua and New Guinea to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the Australian Government will remain responsible in certain areas, such as defence, it is important that there should be members who understand the position and who can watch it not only in our interests but also in the interests of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be imperative that any nominated member has been resident in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for at least 5 years so that he understands the local position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill marks a dramatic forward move in the development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> towards nationhood and it is as the result of the remarkable progress that has taken place over the last 30 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is almost 30 years since I first knew <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and it is unbelievable what has happened during those years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there is a tremendous need for extension offices in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even in Australia great difficulty is experienced in getting across to the man in the field the findings of o.ir scientists and our officers in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization and Agriculture Departments, but there is a far greater need for such a service in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The practical men could have been used to apply scientific findings in helping the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Development Bank is performing a tremendous service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are easy meat for the troublemakers, and there are troublemakers in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> just as there are in every community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would remind the honourable member that this is a Bill to give legislative effect to the request of the House- of Assembly of New Guinea for changes in the constitutional framework of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst 1 agree with the sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Hume, nevertheless this Bill is to give effect to certain recommendations made by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly Select Committee on Constitutional Development, lt does not relate to agriculture, trade or anything of that nature and the honourable member is getting away from the subject matter of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, during this transitional period there is still a good deal of unrest in the Public Service of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that during this transition period we should make every effort to retain the better types of experienced expatriate officers who are in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> standing alongside those who are being trained to take over responsible positions, lt is important that we do everything we can to retain these men who have given so much and who so thoroughly understand the position; they should be kept in the field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said before in this House, we should look upon anything we spend to satisfy the really able and dedicated men as an investment in the future public relations between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, lt must be realised that Australia’s responsibility in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is a very real one indeed, lt is of vital importance to us for many reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important from a defence point of view - not only for our defence but s.’so for the defence of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is important because the whole of Asia is watching how Australia and the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> handle this transition period as they develop their own responsibility and their own nationhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is an emerging nation whose future is important to both Australia and to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to debate the question of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe thai <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be just as important to us as is New Zealand and our relationships with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> must be of the same depth and sensitivity as those we have with New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker,  with some diffidence of course, 1 place before you that we are discussing constitutional questions and the honourable member for Hume spoke rather disparagingly about the 2.5 million people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are discussing the opportunity that has been offered to Australia to help launch <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> into a completely new era. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not going to be critical about this because the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> have developed the system themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter concerns the choosing of Ministers in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will have a fair step to go in its Parliament to end up with the same level of administrative competence as one might expect in a Parliament such as this one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that we ought to inflict the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> with the same attitudes that we ourselves hold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, I do not think that we ought to accept the view, nor should we inflict upon the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> the view, that these Ministers ought to be nominated by some outside body or even nominated by somebody else who speaks on the advice of one particular area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why have we chosen 10 Ministers out of a total of 17 Ministers in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to comprise the Administration’s Executive Council? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the problems, as I see it, in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> stems from the tremendous difficulties created by geography, by lack of communications and by the incapacity of people to operate an administrative system because they are not literate in the language of the Administration, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not sure that we have applied enough science, one might say, or study to this question of the actual administrative set-up operating outside the Parliament in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the people of the Solomon Islands have developed a system of executive committees, and that may well be a better operative system in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we may well be handing on to the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> some sorts of petrified parliamentary attitudes which are terribly difficult to change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I hope that we will not inflict upon the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> certain attitudes just because we have developed those attitudes or just because, back in the early 1950s, a former Prime Minister said: ‘We will have 2 groups, the Cabinet and the Ministry’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we going to inflict upon the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> a set of people who comprise 2 levels of authority - a kind of hierarchical structure? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that we can somehow write into the system of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> an ease of change of the system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I cannot see that inside the society in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> there is any need to develop the kind of conflicts and differences which exist between us here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The economy of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is not such as to produce very deep divisions between the people on that ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might well be possible to develop a system in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in which there is a basic unity of political thought throughout the whole country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, all we can do tonight, I expect, is to make whatever amendments we think are necessary in this matter and give our blessing to the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on the venture upon which they are embarking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Hume accused the honourable member for Fremantle and other honourable members on this side of the House of paternalism because we had said we are setting out some pattern of ministerial selection for the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are offering the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> the opportunity to make the selection themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are now near the point in time when our relationship with this Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be affirmed for all time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal was that there be 18 regional members of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Parliament - there are now 15 and there were 10 in 1964. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting that the honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Beazley)  has dropped his previous opposition earlier this year to the regional members, although in making that criticism, I believe he is being completely consistent because if one turns to the debates on the establishment of the House of Assembly in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in 1963 one finds that the honourable member and his Party were opposed to the reserve electorates and wanted a proliferation of the open electorates which then numbered forty-four. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not been in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> since March. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is little doubt that there is a genuine wish in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to retain this link with the Administration as it is now, roughly speaking, in appointing Ministerial representatives in the way which is suggested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that you,  Mr Speaker,  would allow me to range as widely over related matters in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as did the honourable member for Fremantle who has a great deal of experience in this matter and, if I might say so, left me lamenting, apart from his amendment, on exactly where we were supposed to go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He still favours the Swiss Cantonal Parliamentary system for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One would not think the whole modus operandi, not to mention the modus vivendi, of the relationship between Australia and its trust Territory would give rise to anything approaching an inclination to dictatorship in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>; but I suppose it is wise to take account of any possible contingency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Fremantle also draws attention appropriately to the contrast between the highland and lowland areas of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this is something which will really be in the hands or within the province of the people who run <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from now on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Matters concerning <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> have become somewhat a province of the Australian Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian nation is contributing a lot of money to the development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, yet we have very little good will there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we are discussing the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Bill tonight I think it is appropriate to recall that Australia’s involvement in this part of the world has been intense only in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While recognising that the Christian churches have made a commendable, self-motivated contribution in the past in the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, does the Minister foresee the danger of this policy leading to the creation of an intolerant nation divided on religious differences? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite properly, the Minister reminded me and the House that this was more a matter for consideration of the House of Assembly in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and he assured me that he would refer the question to the House and eventually pass the answer on to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then I referred to the fact that Alan Randall’s ‘Reorganisation of Education in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’ covered this matter quite clearly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a difference between our dual education system in Australia and that of the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>in reply - I am grateful to honourable members from both sides of the House for the wideranging discussion and the interest they have shown in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The report of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly Select Committee on Constitutional Development has been accepted - not unanimously; I agree with the honourable member for KingsfordSmith  (Mr Lionel Bowen). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a great undercurrent of bitterness that I experienced in conversations with members of the House of Assembly of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> about the method by which Executive Council Ministers were chosen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Oala  Oala-Rarua had devoted, I suppose, more than a decade to the problems of labour in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any departure from that principle is a breach of our trust with the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and particularly the House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen these operations going on in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> with regard to the Holy Writ that we apply there or perhaps to the Legislative Council in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are likely to run things a little more democratically in some respects in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The electoral system designed in the first instance foi <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is much more democratic than the one inflicted upon us here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a failure to apply ourselves to the principles to which we ought to be applying ourselves and allowing the writ of free decision, equality and parliamentary responsibility to run in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The matters referred to fall within the authority “of the Assistant Ministerial Member for Social  Development and Home Affairs in the House of Assembly for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-40-14">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will it be the same between ourselves and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, which is advancing so rapidly towards independence? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will also presumably apply to the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> whose people again have a different culture and different problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> draws its criminal law in a different way from the criminal code of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Now, one of the problems in the Commonwealth Territories is that the punishments are imposed by judges who sit in the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> but administered by someone else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Considering that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is moving towards independence more rapidly than most people imagine and the fact that this will increase the importance of localisation in all possible areas of responsibility, I ask the Minister for the Army: To what extent is the Army of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> localised? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he concerned that the Pacific Islands Regiment may develop into an elite in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> particularly in any post-independence situation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main deficiency has been in the rank and file although even in this category there have been increases in Darwin, North Queensland and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>2874 (page 1707 of House of Representatives Hansard for 29th September 1971) the texts of all International Labour Organisation Instruments are, as a matter of practice, brought to the attention of the Administration of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as they are adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-57-14">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3399, there is close conformity between the law and practice of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Convention No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-57-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of the declarations to be made in respect to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is currently under consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-57-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter referred to is one which falls within the authority of the Ministerial Member for Agriculture, Stock and Fisheries in the House of Assembly for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-57-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What ‘ benefits has this tax concession conferred on (a) Australia and (b) the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-59-79">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not possible to say, however, to what extent these increases would not have occurred in the absence  of  the rebate scheme, (b) Any benefits to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from the pay-roll tax rebates scheme would depend on its being able to import a wider range of goods from Australia, perhaps at lower prices, than would otherwise have been the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-59-79">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For many years this Government has upheld the right of the indigenous people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to own their own land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus the Bill will make it possible for a number of the highly qualified and experienced Australian teachers in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to join the Commonwealth Teaching Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a few moments I will set out in greater detail how this Bill will apply in relation to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It enables membership of the Commonwealth Teaching Service not only by teachers in Commonwealth schools in the mainland Territories but also by certain teachers employed in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The application of the Bill to such teachers in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is provided for in clause 16. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to describe how the Government sees the Commonwealth Teaching Service operating in respect of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the Commonwealth Teaching Service can make a valuable contribution to education in Papua and New Guinea, both in the immediate future and beyond the time when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is self governing and independent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will want to draw on Australia for some time in order to maintain the pace of educational development and meet the needs for highly experienced and specialised staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to assist <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the Commonwealth Teaching Service will include a complement of teachers who will be made available on secondment to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Teaching Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The arrangement will allow their career status in the Commonwealth Teaching Service to be preserved while they are in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Teaching Service will thus operate as a base to which the teachers can return for service elsewhere when they have completed their service in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The arrangement is intended to help <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> obtain key teaching personnel and to encourage such teachers to remain as long as they are needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Membership of the Commonwealth Teaching Service will also be made available to certain of the teachers now serving in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to encourage them to remain, so that their accumulated expertise is not lost to the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could also arise when a member of the Service returns from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> or overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has he noted that on 21st September 1971 the Treasurer and the Minister for External Territories announced to the Press that an interdepartmental committee, chaired by the Department of External Territories and comprising officers of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Administration, the Treasury and the Reserve Bank, had been established to examine and make recommendations about  a  suitable structure for banking in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-41-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill seeks the approval of Parliament to the provision of a guarantee by the Commonwealth to a $US4.5m ($A3.8m) borrowing by the Administration of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from the Asian Development Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proceeds of the loan are for re-lending by the Administration to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Development Bank and will meet the foreign currency component of a number of development projects financed by that Bank in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> over the next 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Borrowings by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Administration automatically carry a Commonwealth guarantee by virtue of the operation of section 75a of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act 1949-1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would mention that at the time of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s admission to the Asian Development Bank Australia gave an undertaking to the Bank in accordance with article 3.3 of the Agreement establishing the Bank that, until <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> itself assumes responsibility for its own international relations, Australia would be responsible for all obligations that may be incurred by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by reason of admission to membership in the Bank and enjoyment of the benefits of such membership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thus the Bill  win  make it possible for a number of the highly qualified and experienced Australian teachers in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to join the Commonwealth Teaching Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If somebody cares to disagree and say it should be integrated with some department, although it has not been taken as far as that, they are welcome to do so, but prima facie I do not think one can suggest that there is anything wrong with the proposition that we should have a kind of autonomous teaching service which can operate in due course in the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and even in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides for one commissioner who will deal with the supply of teachers on request from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, any country of the Pacific, or indeed, any other Asian country that might seek the provision of teachers by the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We suggest that before that teacher can be sent to teach in the Northern Territory or in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> or Norfolk Island his or her consent should be obtained to transfer him or her from the authority which controls education in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously if there is to be the number of educational authorities that are mentioned in this Bill - the Australian Capital Territory authority, the Northern Territory authority, the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> authority and maybe other authorities - certainly a great diversity of professional experience and professional qualifications will be involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am speaking here only about the Northern Territory but the same situation can apply to the Aus- tralian Capital Territory, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and various other territories and positings overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Listening to speeches tonight it would seem that the general opinion of most honourable members who have spoken is that it is some kind of disadvantage to be posted to a place like <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> or the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any teacher seeking to broaden his mind could board at Darwin a Qantas aircraft and go on the recently introduced service straight to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The narrowness of opportunity in the past was certainly a real worry to the teachers but the introduction of this Commonwealth teaching service will give teachers a chance to move around not only within Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> but also to overseas postings without losing seniority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be a major success because it will give the teachers in the Territory, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the Australian Capital Territory a chance to move around and learn what goes on in other parts of Australia and overseas territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Part (c) of the amendment - this is the second part of the amendment which is already covered by the Bill - reads: for the active encouragement of recruitment and training of teaching staff, nol only for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should it desire this assistance, but for other islands of the Pacific the Governments of which seek such aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We can think of the Australian Capital Territory, the teaching of Aborigines in the Northern Territory and serving in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite possible that after the system has been operating for 2 or 3 years - tha honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Beazley)  of course has pointed out that its operations will be in the hands of people more sensitive to these matters before very long - and a few teachers from Canberra have been sent reluctantly to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the Northern Territory there will be a retreat from Canberra back into the New South Wales teaching service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to say something of Australia’s defence obligations in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our hope is that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will advance in security and stability through the pre-independence period and through all the years which follow independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s view is that this and future governments must be provided with the means to act militarily in support of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government if the need should arise, if our help should be sought, and if we should wish to respond. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the optimistic predictions made for the oil palm project at Cape Hoskins in West New Britain and its importance to the economy of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, will the Minister inform the House whether the project is meeting these expectations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He will recall that the project is a joint venture between the Administration and a company called Harrison &amp; Crosfield (ANZ) Ltd and that one-half the Administration’s equity capital is held by the Commonwealth Development Bank for subsequent allocation to the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Undoubtedly, this will be a major contributing factor towards the economic development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In accordance with the under taking I gave to the House on 22nd March, while moving the second reading of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Loan (Asian Development Bank) Bill 1972, I present for the information of honourable members the assurances given by the Commonwealth, as requested by the Administrator of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, in connection with the loan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720411_reps_27_hor77/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Examples are the future role of Australian forces in New Guinea and the development of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> defence forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720411_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-33-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pre-eminent is the future role of Australian defence units in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the development of the independent defence forces of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720411_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-33-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Review so profoundly points out, 2,000 nautical miles from Sydney is the northern part of Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720411_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-33-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further appropriations totalling $13.1m are required for departmental administrative expenses, including $1.4m for the Department of Civil Aviation; $1.8m for overseas representation; $1 for rents; $0.8m for the Commonwealth Railways; $1.3m for increased allowances and other benefits for overseas officers of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service as a result of the flow-on of salary increases in the Commonwealth Public Service; $0.6m for the Commonwealth Taxation Office; and $0.5m for the Department of Works. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>7m for an additional repayable advance to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Administration towards the construction of a township at Arawa; $5m for loans under the War Service Homes Act to meet the increased loan limit and to eliminate delays in meeting applications;  Sim  for loans to co-operative building societies in the Australian Capital Territory (this is offset by a reduction of $lm in advances to the Australian Capital Territory Housing Trust Account);  Sim  for the National Capital Development Commission to cover rise and fall’ variations to contracts because of wage increases; $15m for payment to the Post Office Trust Account to meet an expected short fall in postal revenue, increased liability for superannuation payments and additional funds required for expenditure on works to sustain employment in accordance with Government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I therefore ask him why the Administration of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is not represented at the Departments of Labour Advisory Committee which yesterday and today has, among other things, carried out its routine annual review of the ILO conventions which Australia has not yet ratified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Residents of Australia or <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> may be entitled to immediate deductions for subscriptions to share capital used in prospecting or mining for petroleum in Australia or <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the contrary, the Government’s policy is one of promoting an integrated Australian society looking towards political and racial equality for all, of supporting selfdetermination on the basis of majority rule, say for the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and of co-operating with the United Nations towards that end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>8m, borrowing by the Administration of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from the Asian Development Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proceeds of the loan are for relending by the Administration to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Development Bank, and will meet the foreign currency component of a number of development projects financed by that Bank in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> over the next 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition supports the measure, particularly because the loan is in what are described as soft loan terms rather than hard; that is, the money is to be available to the Administration of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> at a rate of only 3 per cent, which is very low by today’s standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out then the difficulty of a relatively undeveloped country such as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> being able to finance development when there was an interest component of somewhere in excess of 7 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister, in introducing the measure, said that the loan is the first that the Asian Development Bank has made to the Administration since the admission of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to membership of the Asian Development Bank in April 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That merely serves to indicate that as recently as September 1966 there seemed to be no indication that what might be called self-government for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was likely in the foreseeable future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a comparatively long process before <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> became a separate member and, therefore, it is not surprising that this should be the first loan when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been so recently a member of the Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I would like to say one or two things about the potential for development and what appears to be the relatively slow rate of economic development in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the fact that to some extent the economy of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> seems to be becoming afflicted with some of the problems flowing from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among other things it points to a comparatively rapid rate of inflation occurring in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which in that year was running at something like 12 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is still an economy that is basically a subsistence economy although it runs the great danger of becoming what is sometimes described as a dual or triple economy, where there is a kind of European expatriate superstructure through which <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would tend to get somewhere in the middle a semi-industrial development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bulletin does contain estimates of the national income for the whole economy of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and to some extent they typify what I have been trying to describe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we describe as the gross national product at factor cost in the case of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is $545m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, what is described as the subsistence sector, although it is the income for something over 95 per cent of the total population of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, is only about onethird of the sum I have quoted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This raises some very difficult problems for the future development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other problem that faces <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is the large imbalance in trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As with the Australian adverse balance of trade, to some extent that is offset by the inflow of foreign capital, but a large part of the foreign capital which flows into <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> comes from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is striving for something that is described as self government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when, as the statistics show, well over half of what is described as government revenue in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> does not come from taxes raised in the Territory but comes from the Treasury in Australia, in some respects self government has a peculiar meaning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the difficulties that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> faces with its exports is that for a considerable period of time it will have to rely for export income on such commodities as cocoa, coffee and tea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Reserve Bank bulletin which I have provides some interesting information about both the world cocoa scene and the situation in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of what <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is likely to produce in the future falls within the category of tropical products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless it seems sometimes that in Australia, at least in our attitude to New Guinea, we tend to fall into the error of thinking that the greatest assistance we can give to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is in building up its industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again the Reserve Bank statistics indicate some quite serious dislocations that have taken place in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> economy by reason of the rather rapid acceleration of the Bougainville development and subsequently the rapid decline in that development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I hope that the Australian Government wil not withdraw any of the succour that it gives to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> because, like the authors of the publication which I have just read, it may not like the Pangu Pati as the government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From what was said on today’s news I understand that a Pangu dominated combination has finally emerged as the government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and that it is to be sworn in today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Business or foreign investment should not go into <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on the basis of liking certain kinds of political groups because considerable fluctuations can take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that there was a lot of controversy around the Bougainville development in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a problem of this magnitude very close to us and I think that this behoves us perhaps to take more seriously the question of economic development in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that the same kind of thing applies as far as Australia is concerned, that we cannot be concerned only with our own internal growth in the next 10 or 15 years without paying some consideration also to what the growth of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is going to be in the years ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is a pity that more attention is not devoted in this House to debates on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The function of this loan is to be, we would imagine, substantially along the same channels as those already used for the allocation of loan moneys from other sources, particularly from this country, for the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Development Bank to use as it would. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the establishment of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Development Bank in 1967 to the end of June 1971, the Bank had received capita] allocations of over $13m from the Administration’s budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one which concerns me considerably and it should concern all those people who are interested in the development in some way or other of the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to incorporate in Hansard Table 1 from the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Development Bank Annual Report and Financial Statements for 1970-71, which indicates the total approvals of loans by the Papua and New Guinea Development Bank and shows the break-up of those loans for the last 2 years to that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is true that a problem remains, and certainly will remain for some time, in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During 1970-71 there were 498 commercial loans for about $750,000 made to Papua New Guineans compared with less than half that number in the previous year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless I am mistaken, the loan from the Asian Development Bank to the Papua and New Guinea Development Bank, and hence to the enterprises and the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, will be a further movement in the right direction, in that it provides more moneys for further and, we hope, controlled and sensible directional development in the case of this Territory for which we have, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports rightly pointed out, so much responsibility which is not going to diminish totally for a little time yet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to say a few words in this debate about the economy of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, particularly with respect to the rural sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem from the various surveys and investigations that have been carried out in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that there is considerable potential for intensive and extensive agricultural and livestock development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be able to expand progressively in the beef industry by breeding up their numbers, culling and building up their herds over time and importing new blood into the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same year the production of cocoa in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was estimated to be 29,000 tons, which represented a significant increase in its production over the previous year - an increase of some 7,000 tons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the significant factor is that the price of cocoa fell quite markedly which meant that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> had to market more cocoa to receive virtually the same amount of money as export income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> coffee production in the last year has increased by about 10 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us now consider copra in terms of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s agricultural development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Copra is an important item in the economy of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, but there are growing problems in relation to the marketing of copra on world markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill covers a loan which is the first that the Asian Development Bank has made to the Administration of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> since the admission of that country to membership of that Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proceeds of the loan are for re-lending by the Administration to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Development Bank and will meet the foreign currency component of a number of development projects financed by that Bank in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> over the next  3  years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Development Bank is a statutory authority which commenced operations in  1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assure the House that the Government, for its part, has a great interest in these matters, as is shown by its activity in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and by the very substantial sums which have been given to help to develop that country - a matter which I believe in general has the support of the whole of this Parliament and of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But undoubtedly the contribution by Australia to the economy of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has enabled that country to grow at a reasonable pace and far more quickly than would have been possible without the Australian contribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those honourable members who have visited <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> - and I know that most honourable members have done so and I also know that most honourable members take a close interest in it - will, I suggest, increasingly become aware not only of the problems of its economy as a whole but also of the individual and regional difficulties which have to- be met to the maximum of Australia’s ability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill seeks the approval of Parliament to the provision of a guarantee by the Commonwealth to a $US10m, that is $A8.4m, borrowing by the Administration of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proceeds of the loan will assist in financing a telecommunications development project in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> planned for execution during the period 1972-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Administration will on-lend the funds to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Harbours Board for a term of 25 years, including a 4-year grace period, at an interest rate of 7.25 per cent per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of that appraisal the bank offered to assist by providing a loan and the loan documents were settled recently during negotiations in Washington which were attended by representatives of the International Bank, the Commonwealth and the Administration of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Borrowings by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Administration automatically carry a Commonwealth guarantee by virtue of the operation of section 75a of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act 1949-1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present loan, which was sought by the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, will carry an interest rate of 7.25 per cent per annum and will be for a period of 20 years, with repayments commencing after 4 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth Government has now approved the sale of the Commonwealth’s shareholding in CommonwealthNew Guinea Timbers Ltd to the Investment Corporation of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s policy is to encourage overseas investment in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which will assist in developing the country on a sound and balanced basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Investment Corporation was set up to enable this condition to be realised in cases where the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> lack the financial resources or the knowledge to take advantage of such opportunities individually. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fitting that with the progress of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> towards self government the Commonwealth’s interest in this highly successful partnership with private enterprise should pass to the Investment Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The Government has also endorsed proposals for subsequent consolidation of Commonwealth-New Guinea Timbers Ltd with other interests in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> owned by Placer Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will extend the range of business interests in which there is local equity through the Investment Corporation which will have a substantial shareholding in the consolidated company, one of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s major industrial enterprises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One might also note in this context that the Commonwealth on behalf of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has promoted negotiations with Japan to develop the forestry resources of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Political evolution in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> since then has been gratifying in its scope and speed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will be pleased to know that we have present in the gallery this afternoon a delegation of 5 Ministers from the House of Assembly of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> led by  Mr M.

    <p>Membership of the Bank now totals 37 countries, 23 of which, including Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, are from the Asian region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Included in the latter figures is a loan of SUS4.5m which the Bank recently approved for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> last month citizens of 18 years had the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I would urge the Government, gracefully and promptly, to give voting rights to those citizens, just as such citizens will have that right in this year’s United States elections, as they have had in the British and will have in the Canadian elections, as they have had in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, as they have had in Western Australia as they will have in every future South Australian election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As honourable members well know, in one place the border between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia is 100 miles from the coast of Australia but only 200 yeards from the coast of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Close to the coast of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are islands which I assume are under the jurisdiction of the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is to happen to the ownership of the land itself and the seas that surround those islands in close proximity to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage we cetainly do not want to become bad friends with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on issues like this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are becoming bad friends with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> if one takes into account statements being made by the Queensland Premier with respect to this boundary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is not only an academic exercise, because it vitally affects good relations with the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think it is fair to say that on both sides of the House there is a realisation that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> must be moved forward to independence as fast as is practical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel nothing but amazement at the arrogance of this man who feels that as Premier of Queensland he can take it unto himself to say whether he will negotiate or not negotiate with the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Who is to decide where the boundary of the continental shelf between Australia and an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> lies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They dealt with the aspects of fishing, marine pollution, the problem of the boundaries between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Indonesia, the problem of international law and the problem of Australia speaking with one voice at the next international conference on the law of the sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is for a loan to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from the International Bank and guaranteed by the Government of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is a developing country - I suppose that in many respects it is one of the most undeveloped areas of the world - yet the interest rate payable in respect of this loan is  li  per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At this stage <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is becoming independent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A couple of years ago, on the last occasion a similar matter was before the House, my colleague the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant)  said that he deplored the fact that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was expected to pay  7i  per cent interest to service the debt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt seems to me that this is the kind of burden that developed countries have to accept in the case of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have been happy in a sense to have seen a proposition in which Australia might have subsidised the rate of interest from the Bank, which is 7 per cent, to the extent of 3 or 4 per cent so that at least the actual rate of repayment both of amortisation and interest would have been somewhat lower for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I have said on many occasions that I do not think it is appreciated by most Australians that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has a population higher than any of the States of Australia, with the exception of New South Wales and Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has a population of over 3 million people and this number is rising pretty rapidly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proportionately that would mean that if a country like <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is to achieve the stages of develop-  f”“.v.i  of other countries it ought to have an investment programme that would be me-‘N red m thousands of millions of dollars rather than in tens of millions of dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other great difficulty that faces places like <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is that for the most part they depend on extending their external trade for any improvement in their internal standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the sort of things that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has to sell are in the nature of tropical products such as tea and coffee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The prices of the tropical products are not determined by the costs of production in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> but on the hazards of world markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For good or ill we have embarked <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> upon the hazardous kind of path of what is called self-determination or independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am not quite sure what the parties would represent in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not a Bill introduced into this House by myself or dealt with by my Department per se as a guarantee Bill on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a consequence, 1 shall not deal generally with the development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the broad but shall relate my brief remarks to matters covered by the Bill and flowing therefrom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that both my predecessor and I stated that, although <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has what generally is regarded as a Westminister system of government, this is the provision of a system of government which is not immutable or inflexible and, indeed, it is capable of adaptation by a future government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as it sees fit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A fortnight ago 1 mentioned a short background description to recent events in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> - the formation of the new Government - and I shall not traverse that area now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>International lending agencies are playing an important role in the provision of finance for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Total <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> borrowings from international agencies including those negotiated this year for telecommunications and ports amount to $60.6m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the help of Australian aid and international financial assistance the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> economy has expanded at a remarkable rate over recent years and has gained greater stability through a successful policy of diversification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will of course be difficult for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> leaders to find the means to meet these needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The framework for expansion and diversification of the economy has been laid down in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> development programme which covers the period 1968-69 to 1972-73. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to this, net expenditure by Commonwealth departments in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should be of the order of SI 60m over the period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The success of the plan will depend also on contributions by Australia and on other foreign aid so that the national programme will not only need to be acceptable to the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> but also must inspire confidence beyond <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and attract outside support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new programme will seek to further strengthen <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s capacity increasingly to mobilise its own domestic resources for continuing economic growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Approximately a fortnight ago I informed the House of the sale of the Commonwealth’s interest in Commonwealth New Guinea Timbers Ltd to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Investment Corporation and mentioned the important role of the Corporation in encouraging foreign investment whilst providing opportunities for a significant local share in the ownership of major new enterprises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s guidelines for foreign investment in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> seek to promote increasing opportunities for Papuans and New Guineans in both ownership and management of major enterprises and encourage the optimum use of Papua New Guinean resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that the new <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> coalition leaders have the wisdom to continue with a policy of actively encouraging the introduction of foreign investment and know-how subject to the appropriate guidelines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am confident, too, that Australians will continue to avail themselves of promising investment opportunities in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, thereby demonstrating their confidence in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s future to investors from other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It comes within the jurisdiction of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Local Government Minister, but I felt that it was a matter of such importance that I ought to raise it with the members and councillors concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have indicated to them that I am keeping a close watch on the movements within <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and I am carefully considering the matters that have been placed before me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thus the responsibility for decisionmaking is going over to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, but assistance in whatever area and in whatever measure the Territory desires will continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If an application is rejected, it is rejected by that Government and not by the Australian Government and, after all, this is a decision that should reside within the power of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this occasion the applications were considered by the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and were rejected for reasons based on the normal line of the policy it adopts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision was one for the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and that Government alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was supported, I understand, by a statement by the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> this afternoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a decision by the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> taken after full consultation with the Administrator’s Executive Council and it is in keeping with the powers vested in the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is that Government’s country and that Government is entitled to determine who resides therein and whether people have entered illegally or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a decision taken by the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as it ought to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another point I might add in conclusion is that, as I understand it, the Australian Government is not aware of any proposal, as referred to in the statement contained in the newspaper this morning, for a joint patrolling of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>-West Irian border. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposition, as stated in the newspaper, of a joint patrol of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>-West Irian border has not been considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a proposal would, of course, involve a departure from our present policy and would require consideration by both the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 24 (1) of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act 1949-1971 provides for such number, being not more than 17, of offices of Minister of the House of Assembly as the Minister for External Territories from time to time determines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A formal request has now been received from the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government asking the Australian Government to amend the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act 1949-1971 so as to permit the creation of additional offices of Minister of the House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>,  Mr Michael  Somare, requested the change to permit him to give effect to certain proposals for the enlargement of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Ministry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has for many years adopted the attitude that no obstacle should be placed in the way of a smooth and orderly transition to self government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to this request by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government to remove the limit on the number of Ministers of the House of Assembly which can be created. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill is a simple one, but it represents another step forward in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s movement to self government and independence, on terms determined by the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an earlier statement to the House on 9th May 1972, I announced that the Commonwealth Government had approved the sale of the Commonwealth’s 50 per cent, shareholding in Commonwealth New Guinea Timbers Ltd to the Investment Corporation of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A condition of the sale of the Commonwealth’s interest m Commonwealth New Guinea Timbers Ltd was that upon transfer of the shares to the Investment Corporation the other major shareholder in Commonwealth New Guinea Timbers, Placer Development Ltd, would arrange an amalgamation of all other wholly owned Placer assets in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Government’s policy in the ,ong term interests of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that overseas companies operating in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should provide opportunities for Papua New Guineans to participate in their ventures at all levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Timbers Ltd, to afford the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> an opportunity to share in the ownership and control of major enterprises largely financed from outside <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this purpose the Investment Corporation is concentrating on building up a diversified portfolio of investments in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will, possibly in 1973, be given an opportunity to participate directly in these investments through unit trusts or similar arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commonwealth New Guinea Timbers Ltd can be expected to continue to make a substantial contribution to the economic growth of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the field of plywood manufacture, and now also in cattle production and mineral development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This in turn will provide further opportunities for Papua New Guineans to obtain employment and training in these important activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, but a 35 per cent interest in the Investment Corporation is being held for the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, which is a substantial share of the dividend which would be paid over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the benefit is not solely to the amalgamated company; it is also to the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard it is interesting to note the degree of progress which has been achieved by Commonwealth New Guinea Timbers over the past decade in the training of Papua New Guineans to accept positions within the company which demand considerable skill and ability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is woath while reminding the House that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> stands as a member of the Asian Development Bank in its own right, although at the time of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> being accepted as a member, Australia agreed to stand behind <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s obligations until such time as it was able to take over these responsibilities for itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A loan of $US4.5m was approved by the Bank on concessional terms from its special funds for the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Development Bank late last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This loan allowed the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Development Bank to expand its own lending to small businesses and  Other  development activities with special  emphasis  on indigenous enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although this type of legislation sounds as though it is concerned only with international finance and capital markets, in reality and in practical terms the increased bank lending which it will permit will, among other things, facilitate loans to personal and small scale enterprises by the indigenous population - not only in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> through its own Development Bank, but also in many other Asian countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless when we take into account that we have a Budget provision of over Si 0,000m this year and that the provision for multilateral bilateral aid and assistance to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as a separate amount comes to only $220m we can appreciate that this amount really is not very adequate when put against the projected defence expenditure of SI, 300m and the talk of a 5-year programme for defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recently visited <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and it was drawn to my attention that there is no indigenous savings bank within the Territory, although there in the Development Bank to which my colleague the honourable member for Melbourne Ports referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the savings of indigenous people in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are going, I gather, towards the provision of housing loans back in Australia because, of course, most of the banks are based within Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst it is only a simple and small Bill I consider it to be an important Bill because it hands over from the Australian Administration to the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> the responsibility for the operation of lighthouses and various types of navigational equipment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to quote briefly from the United Nations publication on a transport survey which was carried out some years ago in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members interested in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and in transport in general in that Territory were to read through this report, they would be aware of all the things that the Government has not done in the field of transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he bring up to date the information which his predecessor gave on central banking in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on 17th March 1971 (Hansard, page 1065) and which he himself gave on trading and savings banks in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on 6th May 1971 (questions Nos 1736, 1737 and 2359, Hansard, pages 2876-7 and 2879-80). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Total deposits with each trading bank  in  <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> were as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What progress has been made since his answer on 23rd April 1971 (Hansard, page 2018) in (a) the appointment of the 4,700 local employees of Commonwealth Departments in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service so that they can have tenure, career opportunities and retirement benefits applicable to local officers of that service and (b) the training and career development of local staff so that they can assume increased responsibility for work now being done by officers of Commonwealth Departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>542 (Hansard, pages 3086-3087) indicated that there were approximately 4,700 local employees in Commonwealth Departments in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2375 (Hansard, pages 2018-2019) made it clear that not all of the some 4,700 local employees were eligible for permanent appointment to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2375 it was estimated that approximately 1,600 of the 4,700 local staff were employed in Commonwealth Departments on conditions generally similar to those of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service staff employed under the Public Service (<span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>) Ordinance, and that less than half those 1,600 persons would meet the requirements for permanent appointment to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(i) Since 1st July 1971 a total of 896 local staff employed by Commonwealth Departments in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> have been appointed as permanent officers  of  the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under arrangements made between the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service Board and the Commonwealth Public Service Board the services of these officers have continued to be made available to the Commonwealth Departments concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An additional 50 local staff employed by Commonwealth Departments are currently completing pre-appointment formalities and are expected to be appointed shortly as permanent officers of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As permanent local officers  of  the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service they have the normal tenure, career opportunities and retirement benefits applic  able  in that Service and these rights continue while their services are made available to the Commonwealth Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to career opportunities, it is mentioned that 54 of the 896 local staff who were permanently appointed have subsequently, moved from Commonwealth Departments to Departments of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service Board is working towards the issue of such a Determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A co-ordinated programme of training for local staff which is directed at accelerating the pace of localisation and involves close consultation between the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service Board and Commonwealth Departments has been established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the programme places are made available for local staff of Commonwealth Departments on in-service training courses arranged by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commonwealth Departments also sponsor local officers for cadetships offered by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service Board and these are now arranged under an integrated procedure which has as its primary objective the allocation of cadets to employment areas to meet priority needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matter referred to is one which falls within the authority of the Minister for the Interior in the House of Assembly for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Which resident magistrates in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are still without legal qualifications (Hansard, 9th March 1971, page 754). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The law of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> does not require that Resident Magistrates should have legal professional qualifications, although Stipendiary Magistrates must be so qualified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-42-50">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill simply takes from the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act a restriction on the size of the Ministry of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition therefore supports this measure, more so because we know this measure has been requested by the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>,  Mr Michael  Somare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition hopes, however, that the Minister is giving active consideration to the removal from the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act of those sections of the Act which give the power of veto or reservation to the Administrator and to the Minister in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it would be true to say that at the present time <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has de facto self-government but not de jure self-government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there is a curious duality about the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There seems to be still in the Administrator’s office some sort of decisive control over the police, and I rather wonder whether it would not be wiser to encourage <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to develop a Ministry of Police of its own so that in such developments as took place on the Gazelle Peninsula, when the late  Mr Jack  Emmanuel was perhaps the victim of a clash produced between the Administration and the people from a particular part of the Gazelle Peninsula, it would have been much better, I feel, if the dialogue with the people of the locality had been the responsibility of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> rather than of an officer of the Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Peacock)  said in his second reading speech, this Bill flows from a formal request from the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most important is the fact that there is a section of the Australian Army - not a <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> army or the Pacific Islands Regiment but, I repeat, part of the Australian army in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These arrangements which led to the introduction of this Bill follow on talks between the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Peacock)  and the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the Press report it was resolved that these new ministerial positions were to be created, but in addition there was provision that the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>,  Mr Somare,  was henceforth the spokesman for defence matters and for the police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the Minister for the work he has done in the past in allowing the course of self government to run as quickly as the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> thinks desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, we have the situation where the PIR, if we have de facto self government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, is a colonial force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If civil conflict arose in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> - I do not want to speculate as to possibilities because that is a subject for another time - we have part of the Australian Army based there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this situation where we have de facto self government what will be the situation in the event of some internal dissension within <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1  am interested in the point which has been taken already by the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, namely, that it needs much more parliamentary control over the affairs of its country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that all the members of the House do not feel the same way as I do about this matter but I believe that the only way the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will control the development of their country is by the expansion of parliamentary control over the executive and legislative power of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the Ministry of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for the perception with which it has approached the problem of parliamentary control of national affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very important that people understand the distinction between self government and independence, particularly when discussing Australia’s relationship with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The constitutional talks that I have been having with the Ministry in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> have related to the transfer of administrative and legislative functions leading up to self government in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The watershed in Australia’s relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will come at independence and not at self government, whether it be de jure or, indeed, de facto, because we have responsibilities to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having put that to the honourable member I say that it has been a view consistently stated by me that in regard to any functions prior to the attainment of self government and in regard to all functions still held by the Australian Government prior to the attainment of independence, I would seek the opinion of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> before exercising the power that was still residing with me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, in the areas of residual power I would seek the views of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, in important areas such as the fields of defence and police, where <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> itself is contributing the overwhelming majority of personnel in both areas, it is of the utmost importance that the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> be involved in any decisions made in relation to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members should bear in mind that the spokesman for defence and the spokesman for the police were asked for by the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So initially the functions of the spokesman will be limited to acting as a spokesman for the Administrator’s Executive Council - the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Cabinet - on defence matters in the House of Assembly, including answering parliamentary questions and making defence statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will also be advising the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government in the formulation of its views on defence matters when they are referred to it by my colleague the Minister for Defence  (Mr Fairbairn)  or myself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will be the spokesman consulting with the Administrator on matters relating to the development, organisation and training of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> defence forces and he will be making public statements on defence and attending to ceremonial duties in his capacity as defence spokesman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the timing of the transfer of any responsibility for things such as internal security will be a matter for decision in the context of the developing political and administrative arrangements between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As stated in relation to the defence matters and any residual powers which we may hold, we will be exercising them, albeit with final responsibility being vested in us, but nevertheless in conjunction with the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth is selling out its shares and passing them over to the Investment Corporation of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, which is an instrumentality of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to this new company will come other interests of Placer Development Ltd so that the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will have a  35  per cent shareholding and the private sector of the company will have a  65  per cent shareholding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trouble with so much in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is that there is insufficient provision for indigenous ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe, therefore, that where there is government action and ‘ where ‘ we are consciously handing over to the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> a Commonwealth Government equity in any <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> enterprise, and especially where we ourselves have had a  50  per cent holding as a government in relation to the private sector of a company, the indigenous equity should not be less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we believe that this principle should be stated and we are anxious that in all possible arrangements the Commonwealth Government can make between now and independence it should do its utmost to develop an indigenous equity in investment in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be a very large Japanese stake in the development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be a government coming into power in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> very inexperienced in the business field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is quite important that we, in our relationship with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, should give the example when we are setting up a company, such as the one set out in the Bill, of ensuring that they have a decisive equity in that company because if they are to go into partnership with businessmen as astute as some of those operating around the world at the present time they may find that they will run into very serious trouble within a very few years of their independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I very succinctly say what we have done in regard to this investment or what the Investment Corporation of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that the Commonwealth Government had approved the sale of the Commonwealth’s 50 per cent shareholding in Commonwealth New Guinea Timbers Ltd to the Investment Corporation of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amalgamation of other Placer subsidiaries in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, valued at $2. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The overall result will be greater profitability for the Investment Corporation and therefore greater benefits to the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, referring to the point about Japanese investment, I think we have to face the fact that as the pace of development in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> quickens and the search for export markets widens, we must expect a corresponding diversification in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s sources of supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in the year ended 30th June 1971 Japan supplied 17.2 per cent of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s imports, the United States of America supplied 11.4 per cent, the United Kingdom supplied 3.9 per cent and Australia supplied 51.2 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Members of the Opposition who talk about the condition of the Army and other Services in 1941 should read the Hansard debates of 1937, 1938 and 1939 in regard to what it was suggested should have been done in respect of the defence of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We expect the displays of the art of the Australian Aborigines and the arts of the Pacific Basin, including the rich art of Melanesia, embracing <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, to be of world standard and a revelation to all exposed to them for the first time when the Gallery is opened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the special position of aviation in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More than half a million passengers and almost 20,000 tons of freight and mail were carried by airline operators in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in 1971-72. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Air transport and the aeroplane obviously have a vital role in almost every phase of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extensive, safe and efficient aviation industry which now exists in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is soundly based on the network of aviation facilities and supporting services developed and maintained by the Department of Civil Aviation over many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>New Guinea House of Assembly has acknowledged that, when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> becomes independent, it will inherit a more advanced and efficient aviation system than probably any emerging country in the same position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has encouraged the move of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to self government and eventual independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am confident that we can work out with the Chief Minister and his colleagues a programme for the acceptance by the local authorities of responsibility for civil aviation in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 30 seconds left to me I draw attention to the fact that at present the Department of Civil Aviation is completely and totally responsible for civil aviation operations in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>of course, goes towards the development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, an effort of which we can be justly proud. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my case, I leave Sydney at 7 o’clock on Monday morning and fly to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> - to Lae and Port Moresby - and return via Canungra, Amberley and Townsville arriving back in Sydney on Friday, This is a valuable week in this pre-election period as I am sure you,  Mr Speaker,  will recognise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It also follows that for most items covered by Tariff Board reports released after 1st February 1973 a single rate of duty will apply The only exceptions will be where preferences are accorded on a range of specified items to those Commmonwealth countries, such as Canada and New Zealand, with which Australia has bilateral preferential agreements, or where preferences are given to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> or, on a limited range of items, to former or existing dependencies of the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The importance of the preferences accorded to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the former  or  existing British territories is also fully recognised and if, after examination, it appears to the Australian Government that some action is necessary in relation to those preferences, discussions will be held with the particular territories concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the outset may I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr N. H. Bowen)  whether, when he says that Australian aid since 1945 has been $1.8 billion and our percentage of the gross national product devoted to foreign aid at the present time is 1.27 per cent, he is including <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the issue for June-July 1972, volume 7, of the magazine ‘Quarterly’ there is an article by E. K. Fisk and Maree Tait, which seems to be the beginning of a campaign against Australian assistance to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be quite disastrous if our aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> tapers off at the point of self government and independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that with the coming of self government and independence generous and substantial aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, both financially and in personnel, should continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to recent and continuing reports of foreign fishing vessels having been apprehended in Northern Territory and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most of this is being spent in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am not arguing against money being spent in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>; that is our direct responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>by leave - Throughout the year this House has been kept informed of developments in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, most recently when on 31st August 1972 I tabled 2 statements which resulted from constitutional discussions held with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> leaders in late July and early August. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly has recently debated the timing of self government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interpret full self government for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as leaving with the Commonwealth of Australia final powers only in the matters of defence and external affairs which it will exercise with the fullest consultation with the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Self government will be formally signified by amendments to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act which will vest in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government Executive Authority which now legally lies in the hands of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government’s policy towards <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been to encourage self government but not to impose it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s formal obligations to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> under the United Nations Charter are not completed until that country’s independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia will not remain involved in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> except in accordance with the wishes of the majority of the people as represented by the House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no question of Australia deciding unilaterally to withdraw its involvement in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In informing the House of the Government’s acceptance of the timing for self government as endorsed by the House of Assembly, I affirm that it is our intention to put our utmost effort into preparations for effective and responsible self government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has confidence in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s leaders and their deep concern for planning the future of their country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been asserted that Australia has not taken these points seriously, except perhaps significantly enough in view of the debate which we have just heard in respect of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which I visited over a year ago I found a tremendous dearth of technical training and of equipment in technical schools and colleges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it happens in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> it happens even more so in Asian countries, as I found out from visiting them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to speak about a matter which I believe is of paramount importance to Australia and that is our relationship with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before very long we will be moving to a situation of self-government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this is a tribute to the far-sighted, statesmanlike policies of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  following upon his very much publicised, and at the time criticised, visit to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> 21 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 also think that if the present Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  had been Prime Minister any earlier we may not have reached the situation in which we are today, because I think that the right honourable member for Higgins  (Mr Gorton)  was probably pushed by the Leader of the Opposition into coming out in favour- of early selfgovernment and independence - for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to say something about the military relationship of Australia with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this matter is of paramount importance because <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is our closest neighbour, because shortly, as I have said, it will achieve self-government and independence, because that independent country may have to face enormous economic and political problems and last but not least, because there are many Australian nationals who will be involved in any changeover that takes place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is the forthcoming selfgovernment and what I call the present de facto self-government in “ <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second is the existence of a number of separatist movements within <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I was in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> during the last recess I detected, I think, some feeling that the Government was being a little bit indecisive on some things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, no matter how politically adroit the Government might be we cannot close our eyes to the possibility of a secessionist movement being in conflict with the government of an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is far from impossible that in such a situation the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would want to use its army. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that finding the answers is not easy, but whatever happens, if something goes wrong in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, Australia rightly or wrongly will get some of the blame for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must still make a maximum effort to see that there is no interference by Australia in the internal affairs of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very shortly moves must be made to pass the responsibility for the Pacific Islands Regiment over to the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to make it clear that this will not happen in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not want Australia to have a garrison in Singapore and we do not want an Australian garrison in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Pacific Islands Regiment should be brought under the responsibility of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that Australia’s military presence in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should be redesigned so that the force becomes fundamentally an indigenous force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our servicemen should be supernumeraries and should act only to the extent requested by the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that many of these questions must be dealt with very carefully but our military relationship with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> must be squarely faced and on this subject we cannot afford to bury our heads in the sand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we do less, we will be doing a disservice not only to ourselves but also to the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the short time left to me I would like to say that I think a very much greater commitment for civil aid to be given to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after independence should be stated by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that much of the opposition to independence within <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has sprung from a fear amongst the people of that country that if it is given independence Australia will up stumps and leave Papua <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many Australian public servants in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> feel that they are being let down by the Government and I would like to see a greater measure of support for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian who is working in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that this situation will be rectified and that the Australian Government will state quite clearly that it will give continuing civil support to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as long as that country wants to keep Australian personnel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>8 presented by the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden)  on 15th August shows a proposed expenditure of $220m in 1972-73 on official economic aid to developing countries, including $145m for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the exception of a loan in ,<span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> our aid has been given, as grant aid with no strings ‘attached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1972-73, in addition to further .financial assistance for the building of the defence forces in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the Government proposes to spend approximately $14m on defence aid to certain developing countries in South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that if the Minister were fair, and if this were not an election year he in turn would pay tribute to the Leader of the Opposition for the wonderful job he did in January 1970 when he visited <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, any objective observer would realise that the visit by the Leader of the Opposition created the catalyst through which all the splendid developments that we now see taking place in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> have come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The change came with the new Minister and it is very stimulating for those of us who have been able to visit that country to see what has happened in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me make it clear to the Committee that at the moment about $2Sm of the Australian taxpayers’ money is being spent on the defence resources in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not going to pass judgment on whether this is a correct sum and I am not going to pass judgment on how this money is being spent in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> other than to say that it is my belief that it should be spent through the Department of External Territories and not directly through an appropriation to the Department of the Army. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 do not entirely accept this argument, because I believe that we could very well delegate our responsibilities for defence and, indeed, to an extent for foreign affairs, to the Administrator in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>,  His  Honour  Mr Les  Johnson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view it would be a great improvement if we went one stage further and delegated these powers to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and appropriated this $25m through the estimates for tha Department of External Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>J feel it would then be clearer that it would be the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government itself -  Mr Michael  Somare and his Cabinet - which would decide whether this money should be spent on defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> may prefer to spend some of it in another way, or it may consider that it needs more defence and spend more of the appropriation going through the Department of External Territories on defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently  Mr Michael  Somare said that he believed that there should not be more than 3,000 expatriates, or Australians, working in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Administration, if I understood him correctly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we have made a mistake in foisting on to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> a similarly sophisticated Public Service establishment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the first step has now been taken to see that the Public Service establishment in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is not so sophisticated or expensive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He talked about the situation in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and brought to our attention some of the very real changes which will occur in this area of our immediate environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We did exactly the same thing in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the aid we have been giving to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been of great assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Along with everybody on this side of the House who has shown a keen interest in the development and the sane progress of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the announcements made tonight, I think I must agree that Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will have to look more towards the South Pacific area than they have as yet done, because the South Pacific area is part of an area in which the political and constitutional change is dynamic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that our relationships with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will not come into the scope of foreign relations and that we will not create a barrier between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia which is based upon the view of one or the other is a foreigner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is very important that this matter be given serious consideration and that we do not build up an elite in the Pacific Islands Regiment to the detriment of other areas of activity in the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increase in aid in this budgetary year to $220m, including the major portion that goes to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, is one of the more commendable developments in our budgeting this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the remaining few minutes of my speech I would like to touch on the question of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which is related to the foreign affairs area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that our good will, our interest and our money will be needed for as long as we possibly can expend them in that quarter, because the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> face problems which are, I think, a good deal more serious than the would-be urban crises which are developed by our friends from the Australian Labor Party in respect to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are considerable fears in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that the ultimate division in the country may be one of highlanders versus lowlanders <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it will be a great pity if <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s ultimate selfgovernment is prejudiced by the inability to carry out what the honourable member for St George  (Mr Morrison)  and others were talking about in relation to other places - that is, the minimising of the gap between the haves and the have nots, or at least the haves and those who have less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The stimulus in regard to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> came from a visit to that country by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  in January  1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said that, I would like to point out that there are one or two areas where I believe there are distinct differences between the attitudes of the Government and the attitudes of the Opposition in regard to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another is the na?r of appropriating $40m, which at the moment goes directly from Austraia  to  <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> under, I believe, the estimates of the Prime Minister’s Department or maybe some other department rather than through the Department of External Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This amount is being spent on the extra salaries of Australians working in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to add to those  2  areas of difference by pointing out that I hope that an Australian Labor Party government will give the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> - the Administrator’s Executive Council as the Cabinet of that country is known now  -  n:n idea of what the long term financial commitments of this country will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt has been of great interest to me personally to go to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and find there a department of economic planning such as we on this side of the Parliament think we ought to have in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am referring to the Office of Programming and Co-ordination, which is one of the departments of government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, The Office of Programming and Co-ordination was not brought to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> because of some clear thinking on the part of Australian politicians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it was brought to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> because of the advice  of  the World Bank and the United Nations which, of course, have taken such an interest in that part of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Office of Programming and Coordination, so far as I can see, is working with one arm tied behind its back, because one of the main sources of funds for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is the appropriation by this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that if by some sad mischance the Australian Labor Party is not governing in Australia over the next year the Minister for Foreign Affairs who is at the table will have an influence on the incoming government and will see to it that a longer term commitment is made to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> rather than the present ad hoc year to year commitment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ail realise that a tremendous amount of the aid from Australia does go to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I want to make arising from that is that it will be good for this country when we do not have to put so much of our aid into one basket, namely, the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> basket, and can spread more of it around to others of our neighbours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we may be able to do this in the not too distant future because of the extra income that will accrue to the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from the Bougainville project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are part of the calculations which would be made when we in Australia decide on some formula in relation to what amount we will appropriate to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> over the long term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the formula should be such a one that we will make up what is required in order to maintain a 10 ner cent increase in the gross national income cf <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps we could appropriate $X and allow for an increase of perhaps 10 per cent to take account of the decline in the value of money, so that  Mr Michael  Somare, the Chief Minister, and his Government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will know what they can expect from this country and plan accordingly, using this Office of Programming and Co-ordination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next point I wish to raise relates to the influence of Japan on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in forthcoming years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I was in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in June the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> ‘Post-Courier’ carried the headline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s first Chief Minister,  Mr Somare,  sees this country’s future linked with Japan and Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are dominated in both trade and aid by Australia’, he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘The big question is how much will this change when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> becomes independent and can work out its own foreign policies’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I want to make is that as a member of this Parliament in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> at that time, I was asked by many people including indigenous politicians how I viewed this sort of speech by  Mr Michael  Somare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had to say that I was not at all resentful as long as I could be confident that  Mr Michael  Somare and, indeed, anybody else who talked in these terms realised that Japan or any other country which built up a relationship with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was obliged, in my view, to give the same sort of aid as this country has been giving by direct grant without any ties attached to it at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that I do not feel at all resentful about Japan’s taking an increasing interest in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more people who trade with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and take its products, the better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many persons are employed by the Department of Transport of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-38-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public -Service  is  arranged into three divisions as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-38-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, like <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, for example. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Government had done half as much for the Northern Territory as it has done for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> constitutional reform in the Northern Territory would be much more advanced than it is at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are advocating is similar development to that which has taken place in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> - organised transfer of powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The changes were made very satisfactorily in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after the visit to that part of the world by the right honourable member for Higgins  (Mr Gorton)  when he was Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the great problems in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> before he went there was that so much decision making was being done here in Canberra, A great deal of this decision making could have been done in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> - in Port Moresby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can ensure that the difficulties of communication in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are surmounted by the utilisation of RAAF aircraft as well as the commercial aircraft that are there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I direct a question to the Minister for External Territories and preface it by saying that I noticed the latest figures he has given the House on the shortage of food in certain areas of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even if all matters in question - those relating to fishing and fishing laws, to poaching, to conservation, to anti-pollution measures, to mining, to drilling for oil, to international agreements and to the questions which will arise between ourselves and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> - were the subject of identical legislation, co-operation, cooperative legislation between the national Government and the States, each State would still be able in future - any State would still be able in the future - to change its legislation and the whole facade of uniformity would fall to the ground, as it has fallen to the ground on the question of uniform company laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Statements have been made recently by the Queensland Premier regarding the boundary between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time the border between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia is in one place .100 miles from the coast of Australia but 200 yards from the coast of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is helping to cause friction between the emerging country of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the Commonwealth cc Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It cannot be done unilaterally and this is one of the difficulties with respect to the islands in close propinquity to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian manufacturer has pretty well been denied the developing market of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> because of the exorbitant freight rates between Australian and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, lt is cheaper to buy goods from Japan, Germany or Britain and to import them to New Guinea than it is to take them from Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The knock down car freight rate from Australia to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is $24.23 a ton, while the rate from Japan to New Zealand is $24.85 a ton and from the United Kingdom to New Zealand $31.09 a ton. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I can assure the honourable member that over many years I have maintained contact with the affairs of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and with those concerned with its administration, and am fully and sympathetically aware of this important area of Commonwealth policy responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-49-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other point is the right of TAA to enter into aerial work, charter operations and, most important of all, to participate, we hope, in the airline operations of the new <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Northern Territory with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in regard to being able to attain the same sort of thing as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has, said that he could not understand why the Northern Territory could not do the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This relates to matters such as aviation engineering work for outside organisation, which has been referred to by the honourable member for Newcastle, the handling of Commonwealth contracts, the establishment and operation of hotels and other kinds of accommodation, the establishment and operation of road transport services, the acquisition of subsidiaries or shareholdings in companies or the establishment of subsidiaries for the purpose of the Australian National Airlines Act, aerial work and charter operations, and operations in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after independence, if requested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To indicate Australia’s international concern in conservation matters the Committee has recommended international agreements with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, New Zealand and Japan concerned with migratory birds, and has recommended the introduction of legislation prohibiting the importation into this country of any threatened wildlife species or products made from them: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969-1972, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Airport development works at Nadzab - Lae, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer next to the construction of a new runway and associated works at Port Moresby Airport in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The proposed airport development works at Nadzab, Lae, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> involves the strengthening and reshaping of the existing runway, construction of taxiways, and construction of new terminal complex, associated buildings and a maintenance complex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Second Division in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service is similar to the Third Division of the Commonwealth Service and these 96 indigenes could therefore be considered as occupying positions having administrative or technical responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-71-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The primary importance my advisers attach to Australia’s relations with Indonesia and the nations of the South Pacific has been symbol ised by the early visits the Prime Minister has already made to New Zealand, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730227_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It proposes to achieve this in the closest consultation with the Government and House of Assembly of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> within the life of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730227_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Government is deeply committed, by the clearest pledges, to continue substantial economic aid to an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730227_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Legislation will be introduced to provide for self-government on 1st December 1973, or as soon as practicable therafter In providing for the transfer of further powers and functions to the House of Assembly, including control of the Public Service of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, my Government will legislate to protect employment security of overseas officers who were appointed by the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730227_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is related to an important matter of principle, namely, the request made by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government for the transfer to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> of power over internal security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it correct, as reported, that the Minister has stated that he has only noted this request, and is it correct that he will transfer this power only on certain conditions, one condition being that the transfer is revocable, in other words, that the power can be returned to the Australian Government at any time prior to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> gaining independence? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member will be aware that the former government, of which he was a member, stated that it envisaged processes towards -self-government being carried out with a target date of 1st December 1973, and that as part of those processes there will be a handing over of powers and authorities to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the discussions the Prime Minister and I had with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Ministers in Port Moresby a request was made to us - and we noted that request - that in part the transfer arrangements will be undertaken in the course of this year, with the same target date for self-government as prescribed by the former government, with which target we entirely agree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister whether the Government, in considering proposed changes to the border between this country and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, has taken into account the significance to Australia of the great North East Channel particularly in relation to defence and also trade and shipping. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask also: Is the Government mindful of the fact that at present this channel is wholly under Australian jurisdiction and that if the border is changed to 10 degrees south latitude, a very substantial part of it will come under the jurisdiction of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The defence of Australia is certainly involved in transit of the Torres Strait; so also is the defence of Australia’s neighbour, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, which I expect will be independent within the lifetime of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia would not give up its use of this channel nor does it expect <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to forgo the use of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the same reason the Prime Minister is pushing independence on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> before the Territory wants independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He would prefer to have a situation in which independence was forced upon <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> before the people wanted it rather than to stand up to a little criticism from some who might still try to level a false colonial charge against Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is therefore bartering the future of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in a way which is utterly irresponsible and against the wishes of that territory and against Australia’s long term interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without getting on to the rights or wrongs of a change in the boundary between Queensland and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, I want to make one point on this issue this evening, and I am sure that those who have looked closely at the situation will agree with the point that I make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had some experience of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> myself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been somewhat troubled in recent years when the Leader of the Opposition - now the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  - made it clear that he believed it to be of vital importance to the welfare of Australia that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should become an independent country as quickly as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Prime Minister will realise that there is no great benefit for Australia if we create an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and watch within 2 years a fragmentation process which will take Bougainville and perhaps areas of New Britain out of the zone of control of the Government in Port Moresby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it to be of first-class importance to Australia that our Prime Minister and our Government should be able to say: ‘We are now quite convinced that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, as an independent country, will remain united’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government has to be established during the lifetime of this Parliament, it seems to me that the decision about the date of independence should be left to  Mr Somare  and his colleagues, for they must be best placed to analyse this fragmentation problem to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be remembered that vast sums of Australian taxpayers’ money have been spent in development within <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told that the Government will move with all due speed to create an independent, united <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, lt can insist on the country’s independence but not on its unity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some honourable members opposite certainly have not forgotten about the State when it comes to criticising that great Queenslander, Joh Bjelke Petersen, who, as a great defender, has safeguarded the rights of a small section of Queenslanders whom the Labor Party seeks to steamroll into <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I am speaking about Queensland, I hope that members of this Parliament will take some care to read the communiques from the Australian Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> about- the situation in the Torres Strait Islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the immediate and unconditional self-determination of Papua and New Guinea, I want to say that the Opposition believes in the independence of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and it made this very clear when in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the attitude of the Prime Minister is that big brother knows best and that the Territory will get its independence when he determines, whether the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> want it at that time or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that substantial sections of the population of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would like to defer independence beyond December this year, but apparently their wishes are to be entirely disregarded and they will receive their independence when the Prime Minister determines, whether they are ready for it or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is also apparently determined to ignore the wishes of the Torres Strait Islanders with respect to the demarcation of boundaries between Australian and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Particular reference was made by the then Minister to the fact that the Corporation was doing no business for exporters from Australia in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and other Territories of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Included in the Act then - it remains in the Act - was provision for the Corporation to insure exports to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Anybody - any member of this House or any trader - who went to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in those years would have seen, and no doubt would still see, the amount of goods sold in Port Moresby, Rabaul, Lae and other centres in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which come from Japan, Germany and other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill seeks the approval of Parliament to the provision of a guarantee by the Commonwealth for a borrowing in various currencies equivalent to $US9.8m- $A6.9m at ruling rates by the Administration of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from the Asian Development Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proceeds of the loan will assist in financing a highway project in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Highlands Highway between Lae and Goroka was completed as a gravel surfaced road in 1965 and is the only access road to the Highlands area which contains almost half the total population of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The loan is the second which the Asian Development Bank has made to the Administration since the admission of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to membership of the Bank in April 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first loan of $US4.5m was for re lending to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Development Bank and the Commonwealth guarantee for that loan was approved by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Loan (Asian Development Bank) Act 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Borrowings by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Administration automatically carry a Commonwealth guarantee by virtue of the operation of section 75a of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act 1949-1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In practice, however, this provision is usually supplemented in some way for borrowings other than those in Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would mention that at the time of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s admission to the Asian Development Bank Australia gave an undertaking to the Bank in accordance with Article 3.3 of the agreement establishing the Bank that, until <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> itself assumes responsibility for its own international relations, Australia would be responsible for all obligations that may be incurred by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by reason of its admission to membership in the Bank and enjoyment of the benefits of such membership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to guaranteeing the repayment of principal and payment of interest and other charges on the loan until such time as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> assumes responsibility for its own international relations, the letter gives certain other customary assurances required by the Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because these assurances go further than the statutory guarantee already provided under section 75a of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act it is necessary for specific Commonwealth legislation to be passed in order for the assurances to constitute valid and binding obligations of the Commonwealth as required by the Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had to look to the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For too long we were inclined to direct the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and perhaps for too long we were prepared to direct the Aboriginal people as to what we thought was best for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister raised the question of the border problem between the Torres Strait Islands and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I hope that the discussions will be aimed at a compromise that will accommodate the legitimate demands of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the claims for title and area of the Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He knows that he went to the Torres Strait Islanders last year and said that he supported their stand and that he would marshal public opinion in support of their claim, negating directly the viewpoint of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is not the time to do it, but I could advance reasons for and against changes in the boundary of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is no solution the interests of both the Torres Strait Islanders and the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> whom I know so well will not be enhanced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He understands the views of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, particularly the people who live near the Torres Strait Islands, and he also has a sympathetic understanding of the wishes of the people who live on those Islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Bjelke-Petersen,  for his own partisan political purposes, has been quite irresponsible in that before half of my colleagues had been returned for the State of Queensland and certainly before my colleague, the honourable member for Lilley  (Mr Doyle),  had been returned, he was up in the Torres Straits telling people that it was the aim of the Federal Labor Government to hand the Torres Strait Islanders over to the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I can fairly say that there is great dissatisfaction in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> at the present boundary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Queensland maritime boundary that can be seen on the map has never been used to prevent the people of the Torres Straits from having access to the New Guinea coast or, indeed, the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from fishing around the islands of the Torres Straits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is about to gain independence and we cannot impose on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> a colonial boundary which will be a running sore for ail time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the future there may not be a government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as well disposed towards this country as the people who are now in government and who have a recent and continuing recollection of what Australia has tried to do in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we must maintain for these people such rights as 1 mentioned of retaining their citizenship and living on their islands, we must also consider the rights of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, given that a continuing continental shelf runs between the 2 nations, to some share in the resources of the seabed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister said, inter alia, that the Government was ‘impressed by the potentialities of the question’ - he was referring to the boundary - ‘as a source of friction between Australia and an emerging <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’, but was also very mindful of the rights and interests of the Torres Strait Islanders’; and was therefore proposing ‘discussions … in January between officials of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government, your Government’ - that is, the Queensland Government - ‘and my Government (including the Office of Aboriginal Affairs)’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through the entire period since that time, the Premier of Queensland has sought to convey  the  impression that the Commonwealth’ Government now is in the real estate business and that we want to transfer the Torres Strait Islands to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to make the point that if in the future there is ill will between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the people who stand to suffer most are the people who live in the Torres Strait. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us all use our influence not to inflame the situation in the Torres Strait but to ensure that we arrive at a solution which is fair to the nation of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and which protects the interests of the people of the Torres Straits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have made a great mistake over many years in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in allowing a kind of pidgin to become established to such an extent that it is now probably ineradicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has done the same in New Guinea over the last few years and it remains still to be seen whether the- policy that he has advocated turns out to be really in the interests, of either <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> or Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why is the present Australian Government forcing <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to borrow its loan funds from overseas and limiting Australia’s contribution to a miserly $10m - that is, United States dollars, the currency of one of the hill-billy group? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is causing this lack of confidence by the Government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which apparently started after the Prime Minister visited that country this year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why are the Prime Minister and the Government flying in the face of popular opinion in Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by forcing that country into world markets and forcing independence on it, especially when it has previously accepted help, guidance, assistance and advice from previous Australian governments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The United Nations has laid down and has asked Australia to lay down a timetable for both self-government and independence for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are doing this in consultation with the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and, following this consultation, a statement will be made available to the General Assembly of the United Nations and to this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have also signed the Agreement, as the Minister says, on behalf of or jointly with the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, which is an exporting country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister has graciously agreed to allow my friend and colleague the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock),  who is the Opposition’s spokesman on the External Territories portfolio, to say a few words about the implications of this Agreement as far as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will just mention the point as I have no doubt that he will develop it that Papua New; Guinea is not one of the leading exporters of cocoa - in fact it exports only 2 per cent of total world exports - but cocoa represents 20 per cent of the total exports of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I join with the Minister in expressing appreciation to  Mr John  Poe, the Minister for Trade and Industry in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and those in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> who are concerned with cocoa production and who assisted in the work involved in the preparation of this Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> cocoa industry is not large by world standards but, as indicated by the Minister, it has a most significant effect on the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Cocoa is <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s third most important agricultural export. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand also that contrary to other trends throughout the world, the total 1973 output will be down due to the extensive drought in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> during 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> must to a large extent live by her export income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even if only one-third of it is produced at this stage by local Papua New Guineans that is most important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government looks for growth in this sector, as I certainly would. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Material from a suspected outbreak of rinderpest from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was immediately incinerated on arrival at an African diagnostic laboratory because at that time they had begun to make rinderpest vaccine from attenuated strains and could not permit virulent virus into the laboratory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The greatest single need of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> transport system is the extension and improvement of the roads system into at least a minimum network connecting major population, production and resource areas to each other and to the outside world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It provides for a guarantee by the Commonwealth for a borrowing in various currencies equivalent to $US9.8m or $A6.9m by the Govern ment of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from the Asian Development Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pause to state a small but important point, namely, that although the definition clause of the Bill defines the administration as the ‘Administration or Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’, the speech of the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  and his Letter of Assurances contained in Schedule 1 and the Loan Agreement contained in Schedule 2 refers solely to the Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is perhaps a minor point but nevertheless while <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has not yet reached the formal stage of self government it is virtually that now, and perhaps it is time at least in Ministers’ speeches if not in the legislation, to refer to the government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as just that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proceeds of the loan will assist in financing a highway project in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Pursuant to this arrangement an Asian Development Bank appraisal mission visited <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> last year for a first hand examination of the proposed highway projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, of course, became a member of the Asian Development Bank in April 1971 following qualifying associate membership of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A previous loan was negotiated with the Asian Development Bank in December 1971 for the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Development Bank for general lending operations and this loan was guaranteed also by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as the Commonwealth’s guarantee is concerned, on this occasion it appears to me by reading the Letter of Assurances contained in Schedule 1 of the Bill to be similar to the clause guaranteeing the previous Asian Development Bank loan for the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Development Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until such time as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> assumes responsibility for its own international relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister referred in his speech to the borrowings carrying an automatic guarantee by virtue of the operation of section 75a of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act 1949-71 but, of course, such a guarantee can never be interpreted as a firm continuing guarantee for the simple reason that the section could be amended at any time, thus occasioning the guarantee to disappear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that such a matter will need to be clarified in line with the continuing aid programs to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> during 1973-76. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I well understand if the Minister for Externa] Territories  (Mr Morrison)  who is at the table now, or the Treasurer, is unable to comment on this matter until after further discussions on aid programs have been held with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assume the now normal practice has occurred and that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has made the choice of currencies and that we have endorsed it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the transferred power this after all is <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1  am delighted that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has received the assurances of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  regarding long term aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the questions to be answered include the extent to which financial aid should be fully on a project basis or whether, as is the case now, some of it should be devoted to supporting an annual or multi-annual program of expenditure; whether there should continue to be an oversight of project aid; whether <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> projects will continue to have preferential access to the Australian market; and. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as mentioned tonight, whether Commonwealth assistance by way of guarantee of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s international loans and through encouragement of investment will continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other countries may well wish to direct some portion of their overseas aid towards <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this matter I assume that the attitude of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would depend on many factors which it would weigh up at the appropriate time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, speaking personally, I see no reason why <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should not welcome assistance from other donors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may even be occasions when Australia and another country undertake to assist a <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> project together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly some of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s natural resources have such a potential that their development might best be financed by such an arrangement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the prime motivating factor is naturally the attitude of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it is not impossible to imagine such an arrangement being made with an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is now withdrawing from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although we will continue to assist, increasingly the brunt of decision making will be with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s own leaders - and so it should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has shown how capably it can administer its affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no doubt that the next few years are the most important to the future of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that, above all countries with which we are associated, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> needs special consideration as it moves through selfgovernment, independence and beyond. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It goes back some years originally to the missions sent by the International Bank which at that time recommended particularly the building of a road from the coast at Lae up to Goroka to open up the inner highland region which contains about one-half of the population of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The resulting economic expansion which should follow from the opening up and improvement of these 2 highways should make a very marked difference to the economy of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> entered the Asian Development Bank in 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far no-one has mentioned the importance from the point of view of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> of its being admitted and becoming ah independent member of that organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Asian Development Bank, apart from its importance to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and apart from’ <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s importance to us, has a very direct importance to Australia’s interests and participation in the South East Asian area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So finance and help of this kind from the Asian Development Bank has a value to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in its own right and in the Bank’s own right, which is helpful from everybody’s point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>House to the developments in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and also to such international institutions as the Asian Development Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the second loan negotiated by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stress, in response to a query by the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock),  that it is on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government that these loans are negotiated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course we had to provide guarantees, and the Australian Government has indicated that it will provide guarantees for all loans entered into on behalf of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> through to independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Asian Development Bank, as honourable members opposite have pointed out, is one of 4 international bodies of which <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has become a member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> became a member of the Asian Development Bank back in 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this is important because what the previous Administration did under the honourable member for Kooyong, who was a Minister, and what we are doing now is to provide an international identity for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each decision that we are now making in terms of self-government is being looked at from the point of view of the impact that it will have on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in terms of independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the time we come to self-government, which the previous Government decided would be granted on 1st December 1973 and which we fully supported, and before <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> gains independence it will in fact have an international identity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We regard this as a very important manifestation of our policy towards <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation we are discussing tonight relates to a loan for the construction of a high way in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As all honourable members will understand, particularly those who have been to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, it is highly important for the development of the country that access to the very remote areas in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should be made easily available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advantage that flows from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> being involved in loans from other organisations, particularly the multilateral organisations, is that it does supplement Australian aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody could say that Australia can provide the totality of the aid that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will need in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We consider - I think I can speak here on behalf of the Opposition too -that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia have a special relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would not want to stand in the way - moreover, we would not want to be seen to stand in the way - of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> receiving aid from other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  during his recent visit to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> indicated that we will undertake a 3-year program starting in the budget period of 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We regard this as important because <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will need to have certain conditions that are known to it so that it can structure its own budgeting arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important that the budgeting processes in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> be revised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not very long ago that the Permanent Head of the Department of Finance in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> - the Treasurer - indicated that the budgeting arrangements in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> were 50 years out of date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad that he as the officer responsible there said that because it was a thought that struck me over the years in discussions we have had in this House on the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> approaches self-government and independence it is very necessary that the structuring of the budget - the budgetary practices - in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> be changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this is important because if <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is to attract aid from other countries, it should have a development budget - in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> it is called, in general terms, an improvement budget - so that foreign countries can attach themselves to projects that are thrown up in the improvement program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will attach itself to this notion, but because Australia has had a very long association with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> it will not be in strict and inflexible terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will be looking towards an improvement or development budget and a change in the budgetary systems in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and we will be looking towards a definition in the Budget of projects that will open the way for assistance from the developing countries in aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In essence the question was why the present Australian Government was forcing <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to borrow its loan funds from overseas and limiting Australia’s contribution to a ‘miserly’ $10m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that the Government is not forcing <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> into world loan markets in preference to assistance from the Australian Government, but I think it is important for all honourable members to realise that there are advantages for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in seeking loans from overseas to finance part of its expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first instance these supplement Australian aid and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> revenue and increase the financial resources available to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point is that it is important for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to establish itself on the world loan market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we leave it much longer <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will have difficulties in entering the international loan market if it cannot provide the sort of guarantees that Australia can provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will build up its credit worthiness as a borrower through this process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I apologise to him for the irrelevance, perhaps, of my answer to him, but I think it is very important that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> now entering into the international loan market and becoming an international identity is to be recognised in the international loan market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We regard this as one of the important objectives in bringing <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to independence smoothly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An apparent technical deficiency in the provisions governing the taxing of dividends is being remedied by the Bill so that an exempting provision clearly applies in respect of dividends out of profits from gold mining, but not other types of mining, in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additional appropriations amounting to $4 1.4m required for departmental other services include $0.7m for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs; $8.6m for the Department of Education of which $5m has been provided for Commonwealth scholarship schemes to cover increases in university fees and the extension of the Aboriginal secondary grants scheme to all children of Aboriginal descent attending secondary schools and classes from the beginning of 1973; $2.5m for education services in the Australian Capital Territory and $0.7m for educational services in the Northern Territory; $3m for the Department of External Territories to cover special assistance to facilitate the transfer of functions to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Administration, emergency assistance to alleviate food shortages in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> highlands and salary increases for overseas officers of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service; $5.9m for Colombo Plan and other aid; $2.8m for broadcasting and television services; $1.2m for the final payment of compensation to sulphuric acid and pyrites producers following the termination of bounty payments; $11. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fifth, Australia has a very special responsibility for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which will soon be self-governing and independent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important, therefore, that Australia should leave <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> with industrial laws which accord with international standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are several conventions of particular significance for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which can only be extended to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and our other non-metropolitan territories when they have been ratified in respect of Australia itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ratification of ILO conventions has also been discussed with the States - at ministerial level at the meeting of Commonwealth and State Labour Ministers in February and at permanent head level at the meeting of the Departments of Labour Advisory Committee held in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> last week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus the Government is consulting with the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to clear up outstanding action required in respect of ILO conventions ratified by Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For the first time a tripartite observer delegation from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be attending this year’s session of the International Labour Conference and I anticipate that in company with the Minister for Labour of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the other members of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> delegation I shall be able to register with the Director-General of the International Labour Office a considerable number of declarations on ILO conventions for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time there, 7 Commonwealth countries were represented by their heads of government, as were the 2 countries with observer status, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Niue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill seeks the approval of Parliament to the provision of a contractual guarantee by the Australian Government for an overseas borrowing by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in foreign currencies not exceeding the equivalent of- $US20m or $A14.3m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proceeds of the loan will be used by the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to finance public works and services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legislation to authorise the borrowing has already been passed by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The borrowing will be the first loan raised by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on international capital markets, although this is not the first time Parliament has been asked to approve the provision of contractual guarantees for overseas borrowings by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parliament has on a number of previous occasions approved such guarantees by the Australiangovernment in respect of loans to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Asian Development Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All borrowings by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> internally or on the Australian Market, of course carry a statutory guarantee by the Australian Government by virtue of section 75a of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the loan possibilities currently being investigated by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government is a public bond issue denominated in Deutschemarks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would, therefore, be insufficient time to seek parliamentary approval for the guarantee after the loan agreement has been signed, as has been the normal practice with guarantees for loans to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Asian Development Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The form of guarantee that is customarily required in International capital markets is similar to those that have been given to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and to the Asian Development Bank in respect of borrowings by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from those institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill is purposely couched in general terms in respect of the currency and the precise form of the proposed borrowing so as not to restrict <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s choice as to the particular overseas market in which it finally decided to arrange the loan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In present circumstances, it seems probable that the cost of an overseas borrowing by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will not differ greatly from the cost of a borrowing for a comparable term from institutional sources in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government wishes to undertake an overseas borrowing as soon as possible in order that it may establish a favourable standing in international capital markets before it becomes independent, as this could enhance its borrowing prospects thereafter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A contractual guarantee by the Australian Government for such a borrowing should ensure the success of this first issue and will materially assist <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in furthering this longer term objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The 1971 Agreement, which was signed on 18th May 1971, delimits the seabed between Australia and Indonesia in the Arafura Sea and between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Indonesia off the southern and northern coasts of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The boundaries relating to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> were approved in 1971 by the Administrator’s Executive Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The 1973 Agreement, which was signed on 12th February 1973 by the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>,  Mr Somare,  on behalf of the Australian Government, deals with the land boundary of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and with the seabed boundary immediately south of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1973 Agreement provides in addition that the seabed boundary lines shall also serve, so far as necessary, as the lateral boundaries of the territorial seas and exclusive fishing zones of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1973 Agreement has been approved by the Administrator’s Executive Council of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition the Agreement expressly envisages that the approval of the Agreement by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly is to be obtained before Australian ratification of the Agreement takes place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The seabed boundaries set out in the 3 Agreements differ in some respects from the limits of Australian and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> adjacent areas’ described in the Schedules to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, there is a net gain to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the seabed area to the south, while in the north some re-adjustment in favour of Indonesia is required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Passage of this amending legislation will allow the Government to ratify the 1971 and 1972 Agreements with Indonesia and ratification of the Third Agreement will follow, subject to the approval of that Agreement by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now have a boundary which extends from an area north of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> through the Arafura and Timor Seas to a point north-west of Australia, incomplete only in the area opposite Portuguese Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems incredible,  Mr Speaker,  that to date representatives of welfare organisations such as the Young Men’s Christian Association, the Salvation Army, the Australian Comforts Fund, the Young Women’s Christian Association and the Australian Red Cross Society that served in all theatres of war with distinction, such as North Africa, Greece, Crete, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, Malaya and Singapore, have not been recognised and given the opportunity to participate and have the same rights as a returned person under the War Service Homes Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it correct that he is threatening the close relations that exist between the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and the Australian Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it correct that the Minister has not only refused the recent requests of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government concerning that country’s future national airline but has also threatened the Somare Government with the withdrawal of future development funds for civil aviation, and has even threatened to make that Government immediately responsible, financially and otherwise, for functions now performed by his Department - functions which could not immediately be readily assumed by the Papua <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former Minster for Civil Aviation,  Senator Cotton,  negotiated an agreement with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government in September last year which provided that a national airline should be set up comprising 25 per cent interest by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government, 25 per cent by Ansett Transport Industries Ltd, 25 per cent by Trans- Australia Airlines and 25 per cent by Qantas Airways Ltd. At that time I did not agree with the proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that the airline should be owned completely by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government, but because Chief Minister Somare and his Cabinet had agreed to it, I decided that I would not interfere and that 1 would accept those conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My personal reaction was that the airline should not involve Australia’s 2 domestic operators as when independence was granted <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would become a foreign country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The opening advice to us by  Mr Somare  was to the effect that his Government had decided that it wanted a new agreement, and the new agreement was to be on the basis that the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government would hold 52 per cent of the shares in the new company, Qantas would be given 12 per cent, TAA would be given 12 per cent and Ansett Transport Industries Ltd would be given 24 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My immediate reply to that was that I would not accept those conditions; that if there was to be any change in the arrangement it would revert to the basis of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government having half the shares and Qantas having half the shares, and the 2 domestic operators would be excluded from the company altogether. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conveyed to  Mr Somare  that as far as the Minister for External Territories and I were concerned, speaking on behalf of the Government, we favoured the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government having total control of its own airline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government should have complete control of its own airline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We gave him the assurance that we would take every step possible to ensure that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> got finance, technical advice and aircraft to operate the service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to see the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government operating its own airline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be borne in mind that S3m is to be spent on the Port Moresby airport, that $I0m is to be spent on a new airport at Nadzab, that the cost of operating Department of Civil Aviation services in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is almost $llm and that the replacement value for equipment, etc., that is in the Territory is almost S50m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave  -  I wish to inform honourable members of recent events in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> of interest to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable members are aware, the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  the  Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister for Defence  (Mr Barnard),  the Minister for Works  (Senator Cavanagh),  the Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones),  and I have, since this Government took office, had discussions with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government, both in Australia and in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, on the development of that country to self-government and independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has reaffirmed the agreement reached by the previous government with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government on the timing for self-government and has indicated that it will work with all due speed to independence for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the closest consultation with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and the House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part of the process of development towards the goals of self-government and independence is the development of organs of government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to suit its particular circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus the Australian and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Governments agreed recently to the creation of a Department of the Chief Minister and Development Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This reorganisation has resulted in minor portfolio changes within the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Ministry and after consultation with the Administrator I have agreed to the recommendations put forward by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government for the formal creation of 2 portfolios - that of Chief Minister and that of Minister for State and Minister Assisting the Chief Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To date the designation ‘Chief Minister’ has been an unofficial title that has given recognition to the position within the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Ministry of the Minister elected by his colleagues, to be  Deputy Chairman  of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 30th April 1 executed instruments under the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act to give effect to these changes and also to give effect to the devolution of authority to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Ministers which had been agreed on in constitutional discussions last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These instruments devolve the authority of the Minister for External Territories upon Ministers of the House of Assembly over all aspects of government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> except those matters for which Australia, by virtue of constitutional or administrative reasons, still retains full responsibility and control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Previous instruments had devolved specific powers upon Ministers of the House of Assembly but the position now is that the bulk of the powers lie with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Ministers and therefore only the powers still retained by Australia are listed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Ministers are finally responsible for such matters as education, health, works, finance, labour, agriculture, stock and fisheries, district administration, local government, information, social development and transport and thus now have effective control over virtually all aspects of the internal government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As all constitutional and administrative decisions now made affecting <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> must be decided in the light of the rapid approach of selfgovernment and independence the discussions were of value in helping to identify a number of matters requiring early resolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance I expressed the view that the continuation of officials appointed by the GovernorGeneral of Australia as members of the House of Assembly and the Administrator’s Executive Council would be an anachronism in a self-governing <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and I proposed their withdrawal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A matter for which the Australian Government is reluctant to continue to accept responsibility is the legal system apart from the Supreme Court of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been many expressions of opinion by Papua New Guineans that the legal system should be one appropriate to conditions in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any changes to the legal system before or at self government must be such as will be acceptable to an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 indicated my belief that responsibility in this field should be assumed by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> at an early date, and the Chief Minister agreed to refer the question of the appointment of a Minister for Justice to his Government after fully consulting the Constitutional Planning Committee and the Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I announced, for instance, Australia’s decision to transfer authority for formulating the Improvement Program and for final approval of major aid projects to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This transfer of authority had been agreed to in principle by the previous Australian Government and is in line with Labor policy on aid for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The review has indicated however that it will be possible for most remaining powers held by the Australian Government to be transferred to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by or shortly after self government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where a matter still retained by Australia at this stage falls within the portfolio function of a Minister of the House of Assembly then that Minister has full day to day responsibility for the implementation of policy which had been agreed upon by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australian governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister of the House of Assembly but, at this stage, in accordance with the agreement reached between the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and the previous Australian Government, these functions are exercised by Australia only after the fullest consultation with and advice from the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus by the time of independence <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be familiar with and have experience in all areas of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, although Australia will continue to be responsible for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s foreign affairs until independence, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is beginning to assume a separate international identity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A this moment discussions are being held in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on the development of a regime for this border between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Indonesia and it is interesting to note that these events mean that virtually all the recommendations of the Interim Report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs dealing with Australian Relations with Indonesia concerning the delineation of the border and the development of a border regime have been achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have indicated, the Australian Government has every intention of seeing through the task which Australia undertook in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> not only in the period up to independence but beyond. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to place on record, although the term of office of  Mr Leslie  Johnson is not yet completed, the fact that many members of this House and many Australians should be grateful for the role  Mr Johnson  has played as the Administrator of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the regrettable dearth of knowledge of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> affairs in Australia many people may not recognise or be cognisant of the contribution that this outstanding man has made to the close relations between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia and to the development of self government in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am not here just to extend plaudits, but his predecessor, the Secretary of the Departmental of External Territories, and the officers who work in that outstanding Department who have done so much to bring about even the acceptance by the United Nations of Australia’s role in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, should have their performance placed on record before that Department is merged with other Commonwealth departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister seems to be working extremely closely with the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and for this we can be most grateful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be occasions when there will be differences of views between the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must recognise as each step is taken that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is becoming an identifiable force in world affairs - a minor one at this stage but an identifiable country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although Australia does not look for gratitude for the role it has played in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> it looks for close ties with her in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But her role as a separate entity in world affairs which is beginning to develop will mean that inevitably she will be looking to problems of her role in Asia, the Pacific and the world through the eyes of Papua New Guineans and not through Australians’ eyes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think that there is a tendency for Australians still to think that they must exercise a more overt authority over <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> than is realistically necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second step will be in the development of Australia and Papua New Guinean relations post-independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust and I am sure that the Minister and the Department are giving thought at the moment to the way in which Australia’s relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will develop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The watershed between Australia’s relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will occur, after all, at independence and not at self government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought to be determining now the relationships which will occur between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[ trust albeit that the Australian Labor Party has a policy on independence for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that the Government will not arbitrarily or unilaterally determine the date of independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the date of independence will be in response to the wishes of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be responding to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s wishes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said in the earlier part of his statement that he and the Australian Government will work with all due speed toward independence for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the closest consultation with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and the House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 trust that it will not be just consultation but that Australia will look to the views of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as the motivating factor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister made it clear during the debate on the Bill that the matters referred to were such things as aviation engineering work for outside organisations, the handling of Commonwealth contracts, the establishment and operation of hotels and other kinds of accommodation, the establishment and operation of road transport services, the acquisition of subsidiaries or shareholdings in companies or the establishment of subsidiaries for the purposes of the Australian National Airlines Commission, aerial work and charter operations, and operations in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, it provides for the other activities on which there is agreement that TAA should have full powers in such areas as aerial work operations: the operation of hotels and other forms of accommodation; joint operations with other carriers; air transport operations in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, after that country becomes independent, under arrangements which are agreed between the Commonwealth and the Government of that country; and engineering services for outside organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 was terribly concerned because there was a convention that banned payments of as little as $2.50 a month for plantation workers in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may or may not be the complete truth that agreements were reached some little time ago with the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in relation to that country’s internal airline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is patently true now is that the rapidly emerging country of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> wants its own internal airline with the shares in the rough proportion of 52 per cent to be held by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government, 24 per cent by Ansett Transport Industries Ltd and 12 per cent each by Qantas Airways Limited and Trans-Australia Airlines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have encouraged <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to propound its own ideas and to think for itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Civil Aviation, who is a funny little man, pokes his nose rather irreverently into the situation and implies that unless <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> gives up its ideas about the capital structure of its own internal airline, he will move to prohibit certain grants in aid to that rapidly emerging country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people’s airline has been very negligent indeed in opening up <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and that is obviously one of the reasons why the Chief Minister of that country wants the expertise and the knowledge of private enterprise to help to continue this motivation of his country’s internal airline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I am trying to make, in spite of the interjections from the honourable member for Hunter, is quite clearly that no matter whether we should protect our own airline or not, we do not have the moral right to dictate how <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should set up its own airline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not read that anything can be negotiated between our Prime Minister and the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is not a half way position I for one will stand in this House and say that the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> must now be given encouragement to work out its own salvation, and woe betide anyone who sets himself up as a pseudo imperialist on the one hand while denying the right of capital inflows from other nations on the other hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill seeks approval for a contractual guarantee for overseas borrowing in foreign currencies by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> not exceeding $A14.3m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to refer to matters concerned with the controversy that occurred over the future of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> national airline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall relate my remarks to the raising of funds under this loan Bill because they have some significance to the fact that this is the first time that the Australian Government has given a guarantee to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for that country to seek funds overseas other than from the Asian Development Bank or the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We support the contractual guarantee because, as it relates to the first loan that is to be raised in this manner, if <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is to be favourably recognised as an emerging international entity it is absolutely essential that the first issue be successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said earlier that theloan will be the first raised by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on international capital markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is, as I inferred, not the first time that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has obtained overseas borrowings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case the loan will be to finance the public works and services of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I want to raise and call into question is that here we have a situation in which <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is seeking loans overseas, and it is saying in its prospectus that it will receive a guarantee from the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at the same time, as a consequence of statements made by a Minister in this House, the actual security of investments in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been called into question and the manner in which the Government has been administering <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has also been called into question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not relate my remarks to the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Morrison)  who, as I said on a previous occasion, appeared to me to be working particularly closely with the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have abstained from making remarks in this Parliament about the statements of the Minister for Civil Aviation  (Mr Charles Jones)  because I believed that it was only right that the matter be cooled and that a fresh and proper approach be taken to the national airline of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as this Bill is before the Parliament and as it refers to the opportunities for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to borrow overseas, it is related to the question of the development of an airline and the close association of Australia to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and it is necessary only a few days before the Minister’s return to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to register a couple of points. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[ reject the submission that has been made by the Minister for External Territories and  1  submit to you as persuasively as I can that the submission should be rejected for the following reasons: When we have a <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Loan Bill before us, it normally is for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this occasion, the proposed <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Loan is to support the budget of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and the funds provided by the loan will be spent also on civil aviation facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, it is a loan from international markets which will contribute to the budget of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a very different loan Bill from the normal ones and I am entitled, I submit, under this particular Bill, to make reference to these matters which will come naturally, under the aegis of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It refers to the financing of public works and services in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which does not cover civil aviation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ruling given by the Chair - I reiterate it now - was that the Bill does not cover civil aviation in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for the Bill is so that this guarantee may be expressed in the prospectus so that people can be satisfied that a close relationship exists between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the very difference between this Bill and any other loan Bill that has come before this House relating to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is stressing the guarantee we are giving and providing <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> with the opportunity to go elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government wishes to undertake an overseas borrowing as soon as possible in order that it may establish a favourable standing in international capital markets before it becomes independent, as this could enhance its borrowing prospects thereafter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A contractual guarantee by the Australian Government for such a borrowing should ensure the success of this first issue and will materially assist <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in furthering Otis longer term objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Treasurer in that regard and therefore the remarks I made related to the very point of the close relations between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the need for this to continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I feel that the Ministers go to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> without an open mind and not prepared to negotiate, the matter will be raised as trenchantly as possible, because it is so important to the future relations of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia and, in particular, to the future development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is more important to New Guinea than any warnings of mine is that it be recognised by the Minister’s colleague, the Minister for Civil Aviation, that he should cease jeopardising relations; that he should cease forcing <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to look elsewhere; that he should cease jeopardising goodwill; that he should desist from brutal, rude, arrogant and colonial views; and that he should go with an open mind to negotiate and not to dictate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is with that viewpoint in mind that the Opposition supports this Bill which gives support to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We trust that the negotiations on Friday will not broaden the difficulties of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in negotiating what is their own national airline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It relates to the future of the new nation of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as regards currency and what will happen to this loan and other loans if <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> establishes its own separate currency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is all very well in the present circumstance where the currencies of Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are one and the same, but what happens after independence when the currencies may differ, if, for any reason, the parity between the currencies of the two countries differs, or in particular if, as so often happens with developing countries - I do not criticise them for so doing - it wants to devalue its currency? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Australian Government pay devaluation compensation, as it were, to the creditors of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on this loan if that country wants to devalue? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a very important matter because I think that in this circumstance, with a government to government loan, Australia should underwrite the loan to the value of Australian currency and offer to offset any loss to the creditor in the event of any devaluation by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that we should in any way try to pressure the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> into having an over-valued currency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is a typical example of this, lt has a very limited range of exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone knows that this is a tremendous problem for all developing countries and particularly for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the only answer to this is labour intensive industry being developed as far as possible in the smaller towns and villages of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government wants to devalue its currency I hope that under this Bill we will make it as easy as possible for that country to do so by saying: ‘Go ahead and do not worry about your international creditors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Minister might be able to explain what would happen if subsequently the 2 currencies were to go their different ways and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> devalues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would Australia pay the devaluation compensation to the creditors, or is <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> expected to pay? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The alternative understanding would be that only if <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> defaulted on the loan altogether would Australia have to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am all in favour of this measure which helps to guarantee an official loan for the development of public works in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know that we will be able to say exactly the same thing for private capital investment that takes place in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know that we really want to underwrite a complete foreign takeover of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have spoken to a number of people in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and I believe that perhaps they are a little too eager at times to bring foreign investment into their country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason while I support this measure I think we should point out to our friends in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Administration that, while we approve of such ventures, we hope that they will look very hard before going too strongly after private capital investment in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What will happen if the Australian Government decides that it does not want to become an imperialist power by becoming the landlord of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and owning all the industry and investment in thai country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we leave <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and our place is taken by Japan or some other country I am sure that many Australians would not regard that as being in our national interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just make that remark in passing, but I would appreciate it if the Minister would explain the terms of this loan and what will happen should the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Administration decide to reduce the parity of its currency compared with Australia’s currency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Country Party supports the Bill before the House and does so because it believes that the assistance which the Bill proposes for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is a correct approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we are dealing with this measure at a time which precedes selfgovernment for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s part in international aid is well known, but I believe that there is a very great need for every Australian to recognise our special interest in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, that special interest will be all the more important to Australia and to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after self-government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has long been a part of the policy of this side of the House to support the economic development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They set a basis which gave confidence for development in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> both in the government sector and in the private sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not want to see that happen in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been some reference in this debate to certain matters relating to the future of civil aviation in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The section to which I refer, of course, is <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill quite clearly indicates that the proposed loan is for the purpose of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> financing public works and services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was said last week that the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> may be required to meet the full responsibility for airports and civil aviation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will apply to transport and to the general services, no matter what they are, that are administered by the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1971- 72 Budget of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was $208m of which Australia provided $36m and in the same year it provided loan assistance of $10m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s Budget last year was slightly larger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think those figures indicate the kind of basic expenditure that is necessary in the government sector to provide a basis for a continuation of the economic development that is rapidly occurring in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member went on to advocate that a country such as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should undertake devaluation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that the honourable member’s philosophy will not be the one that is followed by those who have the responsibility of looking after the interests of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the immediate future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are problems enough without creating them and certainly devaluation would be following a philosophy that brings in its wake all of the miserable things of the underdeveloped world that we do not want to see happen in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggestion that what goes on in the People’s Republic of China could be followed in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> leaves one wondering where the basic philosophy on the other side of the House is coming from these days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly we want none of it in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that thinking people will see clearly that the existing standards can be maintained and that with proper leadership <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will not find itself engulfed in the kind of difficulties that have confronted other similar regions in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Likewise there is a need on the part of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the present Australian Government to be mindful of what might, be described as the ‘risk of overindulgence’ in the field of investment which is allowed into that country from outside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The information given was that 2 years ago Japanese investment in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> stood at $2m and that today it stands at $3 5m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But today in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> there are hundreds of thousands of able bodied people who are keen and anxious to enter into employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the key for the future of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the Bill before the House and I hope that this will only be the forerunner of many things that we will do in this Parliament to assist the development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather do they deal with such questions as the responsibility of a nation that has dependencies, as Australia does milk <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is a member nation of the International Labour Organisation; <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We - including the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> - trust that in a short time <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will enjoy nationhood in its own right and that it will be able to take its place as a member nation of the ILO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the intervening period the convention makes it incumbent upon Australia to draw to the attention of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> matters which are of direct concern to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in return is to respond to the Australian Government as a member nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I add also that the Australian delegation which negotiated the agreements of 9th October 1963, and the subsequent agreement signed on 12th February which affected the boundary between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Indonesia, and which was ably led by the Solicitor-General,  Mr Ellicott,  included representatives of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it was finally arranged that the latter agreement, which was between Indonesia and Australia, should be signed on behalf of Australia by  Mr Somare,  the Chief Minister for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>aim of the previous Government to place the representatives of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in close contact with their Indonesian counterparts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just take the opportunity of expressing the hope that the present Government will continue to bring the officials of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> into contact with the officials of Indonesia because where people are used to meeting and talking with each other misunderstandings are much less likely to arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is important that this policy should continue to be followed particularly before the independence of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and while Australian officials are still present to assist the officials of both countries in their mutual dealings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is also a matter of concern to the States and the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, especially as the granting of independence to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is now being given earnest consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 77d of the Income Tax Assessment Act makes deductions available to residents of Australia for capital subscribed directly, or through interposed companies, to companies engaged in mining or prospecting for oil or other minerals in Australia or <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, fo enable shareholders to qualify for the deductions a mining company must lodge with the Commissioner of Taxation a declaration that the capital is for expenditure on rnining or prospecting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under section 77c, and provisions which preceded it, deductions are allowable to  residents  and non-residents alike for one-third of amounts paid as calls to companies engaged in prospecting for minerals in Australia or <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Government painted itself into a jam by objecting even to a time-table for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and a specific resolution about which we now have no doubts at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think also of the way the Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones)  has managed to put the heavy hand on  Mr Somare,  the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the way that the Minister for Secondary Industry  (Dr Cairns)  is at this very moment insulting the people of Cambodia by spending a lot of time with and currying favour with Prince Sihanouk and some of his entourage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Queensland, Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are classic examples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we talk about the boundary between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Queensland and about inland waters and historic bays, these are matters on which the Commonwealth has constitutional power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The time will come, as the honourable member for Moreton said this afternoon, when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be independent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After independence who knows what group of people from America, Japan, Canada, Russia, China or anywhere else will have a dominating say in the affairs of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Part of the Teaching Service may in future form the expatriate teaching service in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, carrying responsibility for secondary and technical education there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The letter deals with aviation, Commonwealth contracts, tourist accommodation, road transport services, subsidiaries, aerial work, charter operations, investment of moneys not immediately required, operations in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after independence and amendments to the general financial arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Transport and Minister for Civil Aviation went on to say that the additional powers that the previous Government was contemplating giving to TransAustralia Airlines were, firstly, in aviation engineering work for outside organisations; secondly, in Commonwealth contracts; thirdly, in the establishment and operation of hotels and other kinds of accommodation; fourthly, in the establishment and operation of road transport services; fifthly, iri the acquisition of shareholdings; sixthly, in the field of aerial work and charter operations; and, seventhly, in operations in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Trans Australia Airlines will also have the right to operate bus services in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, even though it has never been invited to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sixthly, will TAA be able to operate internationally, for example in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after independence, and if so will TAA be immune from taxation in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> under this Bill and did the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government agree to this? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over recent weeks everyone in this Parliament has become conscious of the senseless way in which the Minister for Transport handled the problem of a new domestic air ser- vice for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had a fine statement from the Minister for Territories  (Mr Morrison)  on 30 April, telling the world that to all intents and purposes, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was in fact virtually self governing, and that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Ministers were finally responsible in many areas of policy that he listed, and which included transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then on 3 May the Minister for Transport decided that he was immune from that statement by his colleague and decided to act like a colonial dictator by telling the Chief Minister that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would have to go along with his fixed idea on what should constitute the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> airline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has cunningly contrived to combine that fact with inclusion of the word ‘transport’ so that TAA will get the rights to operate bus services and road transport generally in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed the question of consultation with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government does not arise and it is plain that the Minister proposes to continue his vendetta against the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government by presenting it with a fait accompli. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that this Bill will, if passed by this Parliament, apply now so that when independence in the next few years comes, the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government will have to negotiate with established operations in that country served by TAA and started there without consultation with its Government and after the Minister for Territories has said it is in charge of its own transport policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trying to deceive the emerging young nation of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is deceit of the worst kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the words ‘if <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> becomes an independent country’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the honourable gentleman be prepared to address a mass rally at Port Moresby or in the Highlands of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and say: ‘I have just written into a statute of the Australian Parliament the words: “if <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> becomes an independent country”.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This wording is an insult to the whole independence movement of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under proposed section 19g the Commission will be able to operate immediately road transport in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill uses the words ‘if <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> becomes an independent country’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is forcing independence upon <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members opposite want any more proof of why we might be suspicious about this matter they should look at what their own Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones),  who is in charge of this Bill, said the other day in relation to the proposal by the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has nurtured and looked after <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the process of making that Territory an independent nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this legislation is to give effect to a series of decisions reached jointly with the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are to transfer responsibility for the Public Service and for auditing the accounts of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to local executive authority, to implement the recommendations of a report on the future of overseas officers in the Public Service and to make minor amendments to the description of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in conformity with the terms of the border agreement between Australia and Indonesia signed in February 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is to amend the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, they will remove the power of the Minister for External Territories under section 30 to appoint officers and engage persons on contract for the Public Service, thus enabling <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to legislate to develop its own national public service - an essential authority for a country approaching full selfgovernment and independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This section will be superfluous with the passage of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> (Staffing Assistance) Bill, to which I will refer later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, the amendments provide for the cessation of Australian responsibility for auditing the accounts of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will retain authority for the Australian Auditor-General to complete his final audit, and enable the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Auditor to commence his responsibilities at the beginning of an appropriate financial period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments to the descriptions of the Territories of Papua and of New Guinea are in accordance with the Agreement, concluded with the concurrence of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Administrator’s Executive Council and signed on behalf of Australia by the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now turn to the Bill titled the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> (Staffing Assistance) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is complementary to the proposed amendments to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act and is designed to come into operation on the date on which responsibility for the Public Service is transferred to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time there are some  5,000  permanent and contract overseas officers of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service and the Police Force who were appointed as permanent officers or engaged on contract by the Minister for External Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government has indicated that it wants to retain the services of many of these officers and that it sees a continuing need for staff from Australia for some years beyond independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has given an undertaking to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that the help of Australians will be available for as long as that help is needed and desired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  report was accepted in principle by both the Australian and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> governments and was published. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> (Staffing Assistance) Bill, in giving effect to the Simpson recommendations, reflects a decision taken jointly by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the former Australian Government and endorsed by the present Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its provisions will result in major changes to the existing framework under which the Australian Government provides staff for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Bill permanent and contract overseas officers and temporary overseas employee superannuation fund contributors in the Public Service and the Police Force, and staff of the Electricity Commission of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> who are supperannuation contributors, will be separated from their respective <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> services and will become part of an Australian Staffing Assistance group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The persons in this group will not be members of the national Public Service of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and they will not compete with local officers for promotion within that service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will however be made available to occupy and carry out the duties of established positions in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> national Public Service and in other areas of public employment until there are Papua New Guineans available to fill these positions and their services are no longer required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Teaching Service will shortly be recruiting teachers for service in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and for the period of that service they will form part of the Australian staffing assistance group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, staff seconded from other areas of Australian public employment will also serve in the group in line with Australia’s undertaking to provide continuing staffing assistance to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Removal of these matters from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> legislation and their prescription under Australian legislation will meet the assurances given to these officers by the Australian Government that their terms and conditions of service would not be altered without the consent of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A scheme of compensation for premature termination of contracts of employment made by the Minister under the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act will also be introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pending the introduction of regulations prescribing terms and conditions of employment it provides for the continuation of the relevant provisions of appropriate <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Ordinances and the regulations and determinations made thereunder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In so far as superannuation, retirement and employement security benefits are concerned the Bill continues certain provisions in the existing <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> law and preserves the continuity of pensions and the rights of contributors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential that the provi sions of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> (Staffing Assistance) Bill and the necessary regulations to be made thereunder become operative on the date on which responsibility for the Public Service is transferred to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government is proceeding with complementary <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> legislation to establish a national public service and the object is that both the Australian and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> legislation will commence concurrently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without any false modesty may I say that, as with so many recent matters relating to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s movement to self-government, these Bill formalise in the main decisions reached during my period as Minister for External Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is a more important reason for our support is that there was acknowledgment by the Australian Government of the importance of the need for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to have the transfer of this responsibility made as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During 1972 the then Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government decided jointly to transfer responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inter alia, the decisions on the matters before us covered, firstly, the transfer of the responsibility for the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service and the Public Service aspects of statutory authorities from the Minister for External Territories to local executive authority by August 1973; secondly, the implementation of the recommendations by  Mr Moxon  Simpson on arrangements appropriate for the employment security of overseas officers in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service; and, thirdly, the transfer of the AuditorGeneral’s function in respect of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to a <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> AuditorGeneral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to be able to retain a solid core of experienced overseas permanent and contract officers until independence, and thereafter; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to be able to dispense on just terms with the services of overseas officers when they are no longer needed because of localisation, constitutional development or other reasons; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to provide  overeas  officers with just compensation for any loss of career or premature termination of services as a result of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s rapid progress towards selfgovernment and independence; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to provide overseas officers, both permanent and contract, with clear information on which to plan their future and, in particular, to assure them by appropriate Commonwealth legislation that the financial inducements to them to continue to serve in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will in fact be met; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to consider the ability of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to meet the financial liabilities under the employment security arrangements which I consider should be made as a result of my inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the whole process of the transfer of legislation and administrative functions to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, probably no single matter occupied quite as much time as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In endeavouring to alleviate the difficulties and uncertainties faced by the expatriate officers in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, it was necessary for  Mr Simpson  to balance a number of needs, which I have just quoted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principal change that he proposed is the separation of the permanent and overseas contract officers from the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service, deeming them to be employees of the Australian Government for as long as their services are required in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Mr Simpson’s  report had not been supported by the previous Government and endorsed by the present Government, I am certain that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would have been totally unable to deal with emergency situations such as last year’s famine or with the extensive program for selfgovernment and independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government’s policy is and must be to localise these officers as rapidly as possible, the legislation allows and encourages such officers to continue serving for as long as their services are needed by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia, as well as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, owes these officers a great debt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the transfer of audit functions to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Auditor-General to be appointed, I have nothing further to say other than that the previous Government had agreed to this transfer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is symptomatic of the friendly ties between Indonesia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which brought about a successful agreement earlier this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I want to refer to the movement in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to self-government and independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members know the feeling I have about the transitional stage which <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been reaching. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have also mentioned in the House before the matter of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> national airline agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the Ministers for the agreement that was reached at the weekend on the future airline for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Communications are an important element in the development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite apart from that, the development of an airline is important to any emerging country and we should have met the requests of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> earlier than we did and adopted a different manner in our approach to negotiations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Upon <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> becoming an independent country and the Commonwealth and the Government of that country entering into arrangements for the transport, for reward, by the Commission of passengers and goods by air between places in that country or between places in that country and places outside Australia and that country, the Commission may transport passengers and goods in accordance wilh those arrangements’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Gippsland  (Mr Nixon)  just stated, a satisfactory arrangement has been entered into between the Chief Minister for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the Minister for Transport in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Morrison)  and myself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no intention on the part of this Government to delay independence for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TAA is now able to engage in aviation engineering works for outside organisations, Commonwealth contracts, acquisition of shareholdings, aerial work and charter work and will be able to operate in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our civil aid and defence policies will have a particular bearing on Australia’s future relationship with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, whose independence will be achieved, I confidently expect, in the closest consultation with the Government and House of Assembly of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Though the constitutional link has not yet been severed, we shall increasingly consider our policies towards <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> not in any nostalgic colonial sense, but as though we were already dealing with a fully independent state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the period before independence the Government will do everything possible to meet Australia’s obligations under the Trusteeship Agreement and to ensure the smooth and amicable transfer of power to the government of a United <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We very well know how important this period is for the foundation of Australia’s future relationship with the independent nation of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will occupy a special position on Australia’s network of relationships, but we do not seek an exclusive relationship with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which will want to find her own place in the international community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s foreign service develops and as her range of international interests grow, we shall be ready to help where we can and as we are asked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will have the first call on our foreign aid program and we shall work closely with the central government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> through a specific and guaranteed economic program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We shall, however, place no inhibitions whatsoever on the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> &gt;n seeking aid or investment from any country she may choose to invite to take part in her development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are also anxious that outstanding questions relating to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s borders should be settled at an early date so that, when independence is attained, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s relations with her near neighbours will not be plagued by the kind of territorial disputes which in other parts of the world have done so much to hinder the development of fruitful and mutually beneficial relations between close neighbours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We welcome the successful delineation of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> - Indonesia border. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We attach considerable importance to the early negotiation of administrative arrangements between Australia - <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on one hand and Indonesia on the other to avoid potential sources of friction on the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>-Indonesia border. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret that despite my Government’s best endeavours early progress towards agreement on the border between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> seems unlikely and final agreement may have to await <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as the close personal, official and political links that have grown between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, there are several strong common interests which we share. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, in the other area of close interest to both of us, the South Pacific, we should, in the future, seek with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and our other friends in the Pacific to build on progress so far achieved in developing regional co-operation, friendship and partnership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recent meeting of the Pacific Forum attended by both <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia was a useful step in this direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This year’s overseas missions - to New Zealand, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, Indonesia, the South Pacific Forum, Britain, the Vatican, Mauritius, India, Mexico, North America, Japan and China - are part of my responsibilities as Prime Minister, even more than as Foreign Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last year, there were some 25 assignments inside Australia and about 11 assignments outside Australia, in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia or North Borneo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  plannned  development  of  <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Forces would  be  seriously  set  back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>National Service skills are important to this program, especially the 50 National Service teachers now preparing NCOs and  ORs  in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for promotion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I realise why the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits scheme for the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Forces - that is another Bill that should have been introduced years ago; it is time it was introduced - is a funded scheme whereas the previous Government’s scheme was non-funded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that an agreement has been reached with the Chief Minister on this matter so that there will be no upset with its Public Service and police force when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> finally gains its independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for External Territories seems more in haste to obtain Australian independence from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> than he is in helping the Territory in a responsible way to attain its own independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, since the Chief Minister,  Mr Somare,  has been rude to him, the Minister for Shipping and Transport seems to have repaired some of the damage done by his ham-fisted method of dealing with the question of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s airline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No-one should underrate the continuing importance to Australia of a strong, friendly and united <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, if <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after independence became fragmented and if, for example, Bougainville separated and approaches to Bougainville were made by some great power for the concession of a naval base in return for aid, this again could have implications for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These were first, our own national security; secondly, a secure, united and friendly <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>; thirdly, achieve closer relations with our nearest and largest neighbour, Indonesia; fourthly, promote the peace and prosperity of our neighbourhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been alienated in the most arrogant fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Independence must be a matter for the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> or their representatives to decide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are a colonial power only because we have an obligation to the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not for us to say when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be independent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a responsibility to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and we have an obligation on which we cannot and must not walk out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under no circumstances and at no time now or in the future should we attempt to impose our will on the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> or their elected representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again the Prime Minister has failed to assert control over his Ministers, one of whom arrogantly presumed to tell the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> how to run their airline system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As with all aid, this should be provided without strings and at the request of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government - not on a whim from Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was we who took the initiative in opposing our participation in the Vietnam conflict, in calling for more foreign aid, in proposing an end to racism in our international dealings, in co-operating with the movement of self government and independence for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and in opening up normal relations with China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes; so has the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-60-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How many persons of each nationality were granted Australian citizenship by naturalisation in Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in 1971-72 (Hansard 25 November 1971, page 3757). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-60-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has he published reports numbers 4 and 5 of the Australian Atomic Weapons Testing Safety Committee which report on the fall-out from the French and other nuclear tests measured in Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>; if not, why not? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-60-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How many (a) indigenous men, (b) expatriate men, (c) indigenous women and (d) expatriate women are (i) sponsored by his Department at each tertiary institution in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and (ii) assisted to attend tertiary institutions in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-60-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth Practical Training Scheme was established by the Australian Government in March 1970 to enable Papua New Guinean men and women to develop their skills and so advance more rapidly to positions of greater responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-60-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Training may be approved for any occupation for which there are no training facilities available in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, or for which the training can be better provided in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-60-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Oppostion supports these amendments to the Commonwealth Teaching Service Act, which was originally introduced by the former Government to provide teachers for the Commonwealth schools in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, and also, we would hopefully believe, to provide security for Australian teachers in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> who might thereby be encouraged to stay in those Territories knowing that they would have security in being able to come back to the Commonwealth Teaching Service . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-115-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was also pleased to see the reference in the second reading speech of the Minister for Education to the role that the Commonwealth Teaching Service may play in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-115-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an acknowledgement of the previous government’s attitude towards support of the developing nation of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-115-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am one of those who believe that education in particular will offer a tremendous opportunity to the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to be able not only to develop their own culture but also to develop their own nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-115-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, does this sum include concessions to search operations in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-117-11">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These concessions apply in respect of exploration and mining in Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-117-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Department of Defence prepared adequate contingency plans to be ready to deploy forces in the Eastern Highlands of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, New Britain or Bougainville if any rebellion breaks out there after independence and proves too strong for the authorities at Port Moresby to deal with? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> there is now a clear movement towards final independence and we are closely involved with the Government there in discussions about the development of its defence force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The process of localisation is proceeding effectively and at an increasing pace, although <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is likely to continue to require assistance from Australia for some time to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No threat of external military attack against <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is foreseen and we see no major risk to Australia’s security arising there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Regarding internal security, honourable members will have noted the important statement on 20 August by the Minister for Defence and Foreign Relations in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government,  Mr Kiki. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said that ‘<span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was determined to look after its own security problems in the future’ and: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The present maritime force is centred around eleven effective fleet destroyers; one aircraft carrier backed by 19 fixed-wing attack aircraft and 15 fixed and 2 rotary-wing anti-submarine aircraft; 2 Royal Australian Air Force long range maritime patrol aircraft squadrons totalling 22 aircraft; 15 patrol boats (an additional five operate in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Division); and four submarines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mention was made that the Teaching Service may be employed in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and overseas at a later date but at the moment 1 would query such a proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to know whether the flow of teachers is to come from the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> into the north of Australia or vice versa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we can assist not only <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> but also other places then we will be doing a service to humanity and particularly to those people in areas in which Australia should be playing a part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its purpose is to bring about formal self-government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by amending the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act and by providing the means by which other Australian legislation may be discontinued in its application to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These amendments result from agreements reached between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for the transfer of the function of the Bureau of Meteorology to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the exclusion of that country from the operation of the Wireless Telegraphy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments proposed to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act are certainly historic, but the changes brought about are more symbolic than substantive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In practice <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is virtually self-governing now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Ministers are at present exercising full responsibilities for most of the functions of internal self-government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guinea has been a deliberate one in a continuing process of transferring responsibility to where it rightly belongs - with the elected representatives of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has involved the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government progressively in the full spectrum of government activities - not just in those areas over which final authority has passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turning first to the Bill to amend the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act, the amendments contained in this Bill are designed to bring about a formal state of self-government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and for the most part will be brought into effect on the agreed date for self-government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Australian Government accepted the wishes of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that the date for self-government be 1 December 1973 or as soon as possible thereafter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the legislation we are considering concerns the structure of government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, another country, which has a character and an identity of its own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the amending Bill in the main merely enacts in formal legislative form the de facto situation which has already come about with constitutional development in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This situation has come about of course by agreement with the previous Government as well as this one that there should be a progressive transfer of power from Australia to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides that the Administration will be known as the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 5 also provides that the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government is a corporate entity which is able to sue and be sued, and make contracts and agreements by that name. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The title of the Administrator of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be changed to that of the High Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides in clause 8 that subject to the Act the Government shall be administered by the High Commissioner of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the self-governing period, the High Commissioner will have 2 functions - those of embryo ‘Head of State’ for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and those of the Australian Representative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This accords with the normal constitutional position of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as a self-governing territory of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This broadening of its authority reflects current practice agreed by the previous Government and this Government that when independence comes there will be no area of government in which <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be unfamiliar or lack experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 11 reflects changes requested by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the composition of the Executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By agreement with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, defence and foreign relations will remain reserved to Australia until Independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, again in accordance with agreements reached with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> provision has been made for the proclamation at self-government of other functions which it may be necessary to reserve pending completion of any legislative and administrative steps both in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such functions will be proclaimed only after agreement with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and as soon as the administrative and legislative details have been completed these functions will be transferred to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High Commissioner’s role in the reserved areas will be similar to the Administrator’s present role in the government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As such he will be responsible within <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for these functions on behalf of Australia and will be subject to the directions of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, in accordance with the policies of the previous Government and this Government, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Ministers will be closely and fully involved in the reserved functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The creation of this portfolio and the appointment to it of a <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Minister will ensure that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will have first hand involvement and experience in these key reserved areas, well before independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through such actions, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is already beginning to assume a separate international identity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of these changes and in response to a request by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government, the Bill by clause 23 amends the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act to make provision for the laws of the House of Assembly to be called ‘Acts’ rather than Ordinances’ if the House decides to adopt this nomenclature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government has requested that the qualifications of persons who may be appointed as judges of the Supreme Court be extended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amendments under clause 28 will allow lawyers with at least 5-years standing, and judges of courts of unlimited jurisdiction within any legal system similar to that of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to be appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such provisions will allow <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to call on overseas expertise for as long as it takes its own legal profession to provide a sufficient number of judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present all loans raised by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government are guaranteed by Australia by virtue of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now turn to the second Bill we are considering - the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> (Application of Laws) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will be aware that there are a number of Acts of the Australian Parliament which have application in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of these Acts apply because the Australian Parliament has expressly extended them to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other Acts have application insofar as some sections of them apply to people, things or situations in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these Acts form part of the internal law of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During self-government <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should be entitled to have the final say on what laws apply within its boundaries except of course laws in the reserved areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus the application of those Australian Acts which would be inconsistent with the status of a self-governing <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should, so far as practicable, be discontinued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only practicable solution is to permit the making of regulations effectively to cease the application to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> of Australian Acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed by this Bill that the GovernorGeneral be empowered to make regulation to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> of Australian Acts, in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Acts to be dealt with are only those which form part of the internal law of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To avoid the situation whereby the cessation of an Australian Act would leave a vacuum in the law of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, it is proposed that the application of an Australian Act, particularly for which there is no <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> counterpart, will in general not be discontinued until and unless that cessation has been approved by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When any Act ceases to apply to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by regulation, the Act will still apply to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that some aspects of that Act, as part of Australian law, but no longer as part of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> law, will require amendment to protect the rights under Australian law of persons, matters or things connected with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> or to make provision for the occurrence of matters in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> affecting Australia but not <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now turn to the 2 other Bills which affect <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> - the Wireless Telegraphy Bill and the Meteorology Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly, both Bills have been drafted to allow for the exclusion of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from the provisions of the respective Acts by notice in the Gazette’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia have agreed that both Acts should be discontinued in their application to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> at a mutually agreed time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reasons for this are the enactment by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> of a radiocommunications ordinance dealing with matters covered by the Wireless Telegraphy Act and the transfer to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> of meteorological functions formerly carried out by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment of the Meteorology Act provides for the Bureau to continue co-operation with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> meteorological services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Bill and the other Bills I have detailed form the first of the 2 stages which will bring formal selfgovernment to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second stage which will culminate in May or June next year will be the consideration and adoption by the House of Assembly of a constitution prepared by the Constitutional Planning Committee and the subsequent amendment by this Parliament of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act to make the Act consistent with that constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Bills, the adoption of the constitution and subsequent amendment of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act next year, and the final step of independence are all integral stages in the continuous development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from dependency to nationhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The June 1973 meeting of the United Nations Trusteeship Council endorsed the views of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australian Governments on the role of the House of Assembly in important constitutional decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Council noted the agreement between the Governments of Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that resolutions in the House of Assembly on important constitutional issues will be by a recorded vote and by a substantial majority representative of the nation as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the timing of independence, the Council noted Australia’s view that there are 2 elements involved in the determination of the question of independence: The view of Australia and the views of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as expressed through their elected representatives in the House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Council noted that Australia expects independence to come by 1975 and that it should be achieved in the closest consultation with the Government and the House of Assembly of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the House that the United Nations General Assembly in 1972 asked Australia to fix a timetable for independence in consultation with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Council further noted that Australia did not disagree with the view of the House of Assembly that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should experience a period of self-government before a date for independence is set. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bills now before the House detail the legislative steps that Australia has to take to enable <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to be formally self-governing before the end of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These measures are in accordance with requests by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and the House of Assembly and have been accepted by the previous Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act will formalise the selfgoverning status of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He cannot see his responsibilities in the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The national goals I had in mind are our own national security; an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, well disposed to Australia; closer relations with our nearest and largest neighbour, Indonesia; and the peace and prosperity of our neighbourhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable members, I present the report of the Committee on Banking in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, dated November 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I present also a copy of the statement issued on 10 April this year entitled ‘Banking Arrangements in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> a blundering and abrasive Minister has done great harm to the prospects of that country’s peaceful progress to independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is designed to put an end to the use of Norfolk Island and, to a more limited extent, of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for tax haven purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to the part of the Bill that is concerned with tax haven resort to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recent tightening of the law to uphold that principle has led to a situation where some private company groups pay dividends to so-called ‘repository’ companies in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> does not tax the dividends and the arrangements have been made with the objective that no Australian tax would be paid on them either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The dividends received by the repository company in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would in due course be used in ways that would benefit the Australian shareholders without exposing them to liability to tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the dividends will not be taken into account in determining whether the paying company has made a distribution of profits sufficient to avoid payment of undistributed profits tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the basic provision, but there are measures to the effect that it is to apply only to dividends that are held in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on behalf of Australian individual shareholders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like the Minister for ‘Defence  (Mr Barnard)  or someone who has the capacity to tell me what would happen if a situationand I think this could well happen - developed in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> whereby there was some major disturbance such as a civil war, perhaps an invasion or some threat to Australian expatriates in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that everybody who is living in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be interested to know the answer to that question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I fear that this Government is putting this country into the situation it was in when I was of military age, which is a long time ago, and I, along with many other young men, went to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, some without equipment or with equipment which was very very old. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill seeks the approval of Parliament to the provision of contractual guarantees by the Australian Government for overseas borrowings by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government in foreign currencies not exceeding the equivalent of $A24m in 1973-74. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proceeds of the loans will be used by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government to finance public works and services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legislation to authorise the borrowings has already been passed by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last financial year the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government made its first overseas borrowings on the international capital market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament has also on a number of previous occasions approved similar contractual guarantees by the Australian Government in respect of loans to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Asian Development Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All borrowings by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government, of course, carry a statutory guarantee by the Australian Government by virtue of section 75a of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The form of guarantee that is customarily required in international capital markets is similar to those that have been given to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and to the Asian Development Bank in respect of borrowings by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from those institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill is purposely couched in general terms in respect of the currencies and the precise forms of the proposed borrowings so as not to restrict the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government’s choice as to the particular overseas market or markets in which it finally decides to arrange the loans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In present circumstances, it is expected that the overall cost of the borrowings by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government will be somewhat less than the cost of borrowing for comparable periods from institutional sources in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision of contractual guarantees by the Australian Government will materially assist <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in negotiating favourable terms for the borrowings as well as enhancing it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments proposed to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This relates primarily to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are doing is legislating for self-government for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are, in fact, enacting decisions which were, in the main, taken by the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in conjunction with the previous Liberal-Country Party Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall that when I held the portfolio of External Territories I used to use a definition of internal self-government along the lines that it was a situation in which the Commonwealth had ceased to exercise executive or legislative control in the administration of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in respect of its internal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The outward sign of internal self-government would be the formal divesting by Australia of its powers by amendment to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at the time of this divesting of powers under the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act other Commonwealth legislation affecting the bulk of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s internal affairs would have ceased to be applicable to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In concentrating my remarks over the next few minutes on self-government it is well to remember that the situation we are now enacting has come about not as a result of recent and radical change in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> but as a result of a continuing and somewhat accelerating movement which started in 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will make some remarks tomorrow about the wisdom of continuing with a Westminster system in operation in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> notwithstanding the deliberations of the constitutional planning committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1968 the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act was amended to give effect to the request I mentioned a moment ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1969 and 1970 ministerial office holders gradually assumed responsibility and became more involved in governing <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The initiative for this devolution of authority and responsibility, which is a continuing one, rests with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Ministers and with the support of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Governments policy - regrettably it is not reflected accurately to date although it has been the aim yet not the result of this Government’s administration - that the initiatives for constitutional development should come from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore we would not impose self-government or a self-government date on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stated consistently that the Australian Government stood ready to give selfgovernment to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its aim was to help and encourage <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> towards that goal, but the decision to accept self-government was one for the House of Assembly to speak about or to indicate the way in which the wishes of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on the question could be clearly seen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was done, and it was agreed last year after constitutional discussions between myself and the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that the aim for self-government would be 1 December 1973 or as soon as possible thereafter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are doing now is to ensure that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> can in fact and in law reach self-government on that day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a sudden jump from one status and set of responsibilities to another but it should be seen as emerging from a series of steps which were agreed upon in advance by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was some discussion last year and prior to that as to whether the power over internal security should pass to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on self-government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not necessarily subscribe to that view but in any case the Government has adopted the attitude - the Government has not put it to us but we have had to glean it from a number of remarks - that internal security and the power over internal security will pass to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> during the period from selfgovernment to independence or prior to 1 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has a prime duty to advise the Parliament as to what program of defence arrangements related to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is being determined by his Department, by the Department of External Territories and of course by the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to be advised of the consideration that has been given to the organisation, training and other matters relative to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> forces which could be accomplished now without prejudice to their ultimate size and shape. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that stage I was referring to the lack of information provided by the Minister for Defence  (Mr Barnard)  about the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Defence Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last week I referred to the Force as the Pacific Islands Regiment and I am grateful to the Minister for reminidng me that in fact on 26 January an announcement was made that thereafter it would be referred to as the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Defence Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is more than time for the Minister to advise this Parliament on the stage of negotiations reached between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia on the future structure, deployment, size, etc., of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Defence Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I referred, for example, to consideration of organisation, training and other matters relative to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Defence Force which could be accomplished now without prejudice to its size and shape. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I referred to the need for study and consultations with and increased responsibility by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> authorities in defence matters right up to the time of independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> now has a Minister for Defence,  Mr Albert  MaoriKiki. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undoubtedly he will be wanting to play a real role in the House of Assembly in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to be advised of the concepts for the future role and deployment of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> forces in a post-independence situation as it is seen by both the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard little or nothing from the Minister for Defence about either the matters I have mentioned or the financial arrangements on defence between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia in the period of internal selfgovernment and at independence - that is, between 1 December and whatever date is agreed upon for independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we have is statements about independence in the life of the Australian Parliament - that must have as much relevance to the progress of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as has the life of the Norwegian Parliament - and statements earlier in the year by the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Morrison)  that independence would be reached some time in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The date of independence must be determined, at least in the practical sense, by consultation between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia; but the prime determinant must be the desire of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, as expressed by the leadership group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> must determine the date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought not to be imposing the date of independence on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me to be placing stresses on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> instead of easing it along the road towards independence and continuing the smooth and orderly transition towards self-government which was being carried on under the previous Government’s administration of the Territory and, in fairness, under the moves towards selfgovernment by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further criticism that I have regarding independence is that it is inconceivable to me that this Government should allow <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to be shortly approaching the stage of independence without determining what the basic relations between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be when that country reaches the stage of independence, or when the watershed actually occurs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must determine the basic approach and be guided particularly by the attitude of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as to how it sees its relations with Australia as well as its relations with other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After 1 December <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be responsible for all domestic matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, the decision was reached by the previous Government in conjunction with the coalition Government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Between 1 December and independence Australia will be dealing with defence and foreign affairs matters on behalf of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> but in conjunction with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well to bear in mind that we ought to be distinguishing now between Australia’s relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s own foreign relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to develop our relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> having proper regard to Australia’s national interests, and we should expect <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to do precisely the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor, as I have said on previous occasions, should we expect that over the years <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s national interests, as they are better defined and as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s political leaders become more conscious of them, will not become more and more divergent from those of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are being given sparse information as to what relations between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia after independence are foreseen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that yet another breakdown in relations was the way in which there was fighting over whether <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would be allowed to join in the AustraliaJapan ministerial talks in Tokyo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To give credit to the Minister, from the leaks I have heard around this Parliament it would appear that it was only through his strong representations that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was allowed to attend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely increasing investment and improved relations between Japan and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> alone would dictate that  Mr Albert  Maori Kiki be allowed to represent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the close and abiding relations between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should have dictated that  Mr Albert  Maori Kiki be present at the AustraliaJapan ministerial committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is another example of the wishes of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government being secondary to the determinations of individual Ministers or the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been too close to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for too long to allow this to happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stress again the necessity to distinguish between Australia’s foreign relations interests and the proper regard that she must pay to her national interests when making those assessments and the fact that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be making similar considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore mutual discussion should be held now to determine the form which relations with other countries should take as well as with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in a postindependence situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, as I have said, Australia’s relationship with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is in the process of changing fundamentally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking personally, I always valued a close association with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and I hope that Ministers in this Government - I mean Ministers in the plural - will see that that situation continues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the Ministers of this Government ought to be in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> continuously to reassure the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> about the aid programs and helping it during this sensitive time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should be there to stress that so far as Australia-<span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> relations are concerned <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will occupy a special place as a recipient of aid from Australia in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people would regard <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s movement towards independence at the present moment as exciting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can imagine a situation some time in the future in which <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, independent and developing, has close and friendly relations with Australia that have stabilised into a permanent reality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let no one dismiss the sensitive period towards which <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is moving now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have the utmost confidence in the future of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, provided the government of the day in this country, whichever Government it may be, gives the assistance requested by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and does not impose its views on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought to be taking steps now to determine what our relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be after independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am confident that provided there are efforts by men of goodwill in both <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia we can achieve that goal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words she will look to both the Pacific and South East Asia as she has not had to do before and we should be preparing ourselves - not simply <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> - for the time when that stage is reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said that I am optimistic about the future of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She has domestic problems of management, a small number of Papua New Guineans in high positions in the Public Service and a small indigenous tax base. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People in Australia do not seem to realise the deep sensitivity of the question of the Papua-Queensland border and what it could cause internationally and within <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> if it were unresolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope an earnest endeavour is made not to shout from the Federal Parliament to the Queensland Parliament that the decision will be taken unilaterally but that cognisance will be given to the provisions of the Constitution and that negotiations will be held between the Queensland Government, the Federal Government, the people of the Torres Strait Island and, in particular, the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should have known that he had no power to change it and it was wrong to mislead the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must recognise that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be independent and looking to Asia and the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be stresses and strains and we, in this Parliament, will need to be tolerant of the relations that occur between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that Australia can be proud of the role she has played in moving towards self-government and independence for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> but that does not mean that she should be looking for thanks from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have mentioned once before the debt that Australia owes the Department and successive Administrators in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, on behalf of the Opposition - and I am sure that those honourable members who follow me in this debate will say the same - I wish well the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the institution of the House of Assembly in their relations with this current Australian Government as they move towards independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the great and growing appreciation of the prospects and problems of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by the 2 major parties in this House there still remains in the community at large too many stereotyped and simplistic views on the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am often amazed by what some of my constituents say to me about <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many still assume that unless <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is identical in form to Australia that country will not be ready for self-government and independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The die was cast when the honourable member for Kooyong was the Minister for External Territories, and I think the casting has resulted in this collection of Bills, particularly the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the recess I had the privilege of being a member of the first all party parliamentary delegation that has made an official visit to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to pick up something that was said by the honourable member for Kooyong about the interest shown by Prime Ministers in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to the honourable member that the previous Prime Minister did not go to that country and that the present Prime Minister who has a great interest in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was there within 2 months of gaining office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may be a lot of problems but Australia has plenty of problems and I am quite sure that we do not envisage that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be faced with anything like the problems of such a sophisticated nation as Northern Ireland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there were about 155 local government councils in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the constant problem of land, but this again would be best solved by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> people themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that we have to assure the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as much as possible that Australia is committed to continuing finance in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Budget was a record Budget and much of the various allocations were negotiated between the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Law and order have been trotted around Australia as well as in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, Law and order is a cliche. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think that the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government, the Australian Government and the Australian people must not ignore the underlying social tensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>B. D. Miller, who said in a recent issue of the ‘Australian Outlook’ that Australia has been gravely at fault in the past in delaying the separation of the armed forces of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from those of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been a lot of headlines in the Australian newspapers and in papers in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> about certain riots. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of his conclusions were that nowhere in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has public order ever broken down completely but that there are distinct problems in different areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have little time in which to describe the clan society of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the kinds of leaders with which it has grown up; one could possibly describe them as ascribed leadership and achieved leadership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government is now developing its own ideas about laws which will have country-wide applicability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I was in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> a report was brought down in the Parliament on the first thoughts about the development of these laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the old certainties of village life have disappeared and the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> society is in a constant state of trying to adapt to changing conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Royal <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Constabulary has filled this gap. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To sum up, I do not think that there is so much a law and order problem in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as a number of specific fields in which stresses within the society threaten public order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tensions have developed throughout societies in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as a result of rapid change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Kooyong has just stated, it is the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> who have to make up their own minds and we have to let them go ahead and do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill will allow <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to have its own home-grown constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not in any way pre-empt any of the decisions of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> or of the committees working out these things at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Attitudes of Australian politics have little to do with the underlying factors and the qualities and initiatives of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> people and their past, present and future leaders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill relates to the bringing of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> into self-government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> attains self-government by 1 December next. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I feel that the present Government is forcing <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> into an international void by pushing it too fast towards independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the nations of the Third World, in particular the African and Arab nations, have told this Government to get rid of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the responsibilities which the Government has for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years past the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has needed the advice, guidance and assistance given by previous administrations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No political gains were to be made by any government in Australia which was helping <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier this year - I believe it was in March or April - the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  introduced 2 Bills concerning overseas loans to be raised by the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government made a loan of approximately J 10m at cheap interest rates to the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the balance had to be obtained overseas and it is my understanding that we advised the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that deutsche marks would be available if it applied for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the economic area we are forcing the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to go on to the open market to obtain loans when our coffers in Australia are full and overflowing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the present Australian Government is endeavouring to dictate policies to and the future of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For proof of this statement, we need only to read reports of the dispute that arose in connection with the airlines policy in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the problems in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Minister for Transport and Minister for Civil Aviation  (Mr Charles Jones)  made it quite clear to everybody in Australia that he rigorously opposed Ansett Airlines of Australia having any truck with an airline to be set up in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is self-government as envisaged by the Australian Government a means by which we can dictate our form of independence and our policies to the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel realIy pleased that the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> ultimately made its own decision on the airlines problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The difficulty in this matter highlighted the deteriorating relations between the Australian Government and the Government and people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that our present policy should be carried out, as the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock)  said earlier today, more by way of listening to Ministers of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and in advising, guiding and helping them, as has been the practice in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We read in the newspapers - I cannot confirm what I am about to say, but I believe it to be correct - that militant trade union officials were castigated on at least 2 occasions by Ministers of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for interfering in union matters in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘low Australians to interfere with the internal affairs of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But until and unless the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> reaches the point where it asks for that advice, we should let it tread its steps first to self-government and ultimately to independence in its own way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel certain that there is in Australia a rising feeling of opinion that the present Australian Government is forcing independence on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The uneasy feeling is held that the Australian Government is casting adrift its responsibilities with respect to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are severing the umbilical cord between our 2 nations without any real reason for such action except that a Labor Government is now in power in Australia and people and governments throughout the world obviously are criticising that Labor Government for the continuing colonial trends or tendencies with respect to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Independence for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would be little more than a tidying up exercise as independence flows on readily from self government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This statement indicates not only to Australians but also to the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that there is very little difference between self government and independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in fact we heard the previous Minister for External Territories, the honourable member for Kooyong, say that there were certain areas in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that still . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the attainment of self-government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Australia will still look after defence and foreign affairs but there is the matter of internal security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a speech which he made on 9 May 1972 and which is reported in Hansard at page 2203 the Prime Minister, when talking about selfgovernment and independence for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would decide when they should reach independence, not the Minister or the Government in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no mention in that statement of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no mention of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the statement made by the Minister and reported in the Age’ of 3 April this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It wants to throw the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to the wolves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are we doing as far as currency in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is concerned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, on 3 occasions we have affected the purchasing power and selling ability of the people in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But how do our revaluations affect the spending power of the people in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore they did not discuss this very vital problem with the people, the Ministers, or the Parliament of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not the way to run our relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which has depended on Australia for aid, assistance and guidance since the early post-war years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all realise that the Chief Minister from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> came to Australia for discussions to be held from 16 to 18 January last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the discussions the Chief Minister emphasised that until <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> had progressed further towards self government his Government would be reluctant to enter into any firm commitment on a date for independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as  Mr Somare,  his Ministers, the Parliament and the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are concerned, independence should be a word of hope and promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to many in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> it is a dirty word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here is a man - the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> - imploring Australia not to throw them to the wolves, not to cast them aside, and we have done nothing about it since he wrote this article for the Melbourne Herald’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been no discussion with the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in relation to the date of independence or in relation to the decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet he, the Chief Minister, has all these problems and realises that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> could be in dire trouble unless Australia or some other country gives them guidance, aid and assurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could be Japan that will provide <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> with the aid and assurances that we as a country have given them in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, Australia is affecting the ability of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to buy, sell and trade because we are making the decisions regarding currency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to make it clear that these Bills are part of a consistent policy by both the former Government and the present Government in the move towards complete independence by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Balaclava  (Mr Whittorn)  seemed to indicate - I think he even said this - that we were in danger of pushing <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> into an international void. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things that give me a great deal of hope in this regard is that earlier this year I was privileged to take part in the first all-party parliamentary delegation to visit <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am well aware that many members of this House have paid many visits to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and know a great deal more about it than I do; but I think it was important that the Australian Parliament was represented in this way as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> approaches very shortly self-government and finally independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that we will force <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to do anything that it does not wish to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognise that in the highlands and in other parts of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> there is a feeling among many people that we could be moving too quickly; but this is understandable when we consider that many of the people in the highlands of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> were living literally in the Stone Age at the time of the Second World War. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Independence will come to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> when the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> decide that it is time for them to have it <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ministers in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> who will be charged with making the decisions in governing their country make those decisions now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was impressed by both the political leaders and the administrative leaders whom I met when we visited <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will still need to give <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> both the intellectual and financial nourishment it requires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot give up our responsibility to provide the necessary finance to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The way in which the Bills that come before this House are discussed will have an influence on the way in which the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> approach the tasks which lie before them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Soon <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will achieve independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will have to work out its own destiny but it is up to us to see that the path is smooth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a particular interest in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> because in my electorate the Taree Municipal Council in the Manning area has an association with a local governing body in Goroka. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock)  said, we should be reminded at this time of some of the problems and difficulties that exist in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we should also give some consideration to the fact that people who are stressing that they are anti-colonialist and want to give the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> independence are advocating something that is even more detrimental than colonialism, that is, pushing people or rushing people into independence before they are prepared for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this Government is making a mistake at the moment because it is not listening sufficiently to men like Michael Somare and other leaders in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> who are looking to the future with confidence but knowing that it will bring with it many difficulties and complex situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was delighted to hear the remarks of the honourable member for Kooyong about Albert Maori Kiki, who is the Minister for Defence and Foreign Relations in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I attended a South Pacific Commission conference a couple of weeks ago at which he led the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> delegation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was impressed with his political maturity, the way in which he handled the situation and with his presentation of the case for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already referred to the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>,  Mr Michael  Somare, and the contribution that he has made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this time we also should have some thought of and  should  give congratulations to those who, in the early days, played their part in bringing <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and its people to the stage of development it has now reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the Department itself, the Administration, district commissioners and all the many and varied people who, in their own way, played their part and made a contribution to the progress and development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Balaclava  (Mr Whittorn)  referred to the establishment of an airline in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this goodwill continues to be shown independence will occur to the advantage of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as well as the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I join the honourable member for Kooyong in wishing the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the House of Assembly all good wishes for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They take the territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> towards the date of December 1973 when self-government will be formally established there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was my privilege, under the leadership of the honourable member for Banks  (Mr Martin),  and accompanied by the honourable member for Macarthur  (Mr Kerin),  the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Innes),  the honourable member for Diamond Valley  (Mr McKenzie),  the honourable member for Wimmera  (Mr King)  and  Senator Durack  of Western Australia, to constitute the first Australian parliamentary delegation to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> during June of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Macarthur pointed out, even at the d:te of self government - an historic occasion on which there will be ratification of the control of a function that has virtually been controlled for at least 12 months because self government has virtually been operating within <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for this period of time - there will be a certain amount of turbulence and enthusiasm that will probably lead to a number of social problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst that may be the case, I feel that his expressions in relation to this matter were accurate and that he showed wisdom when he said that it must be upon the local authorities and the local police - the Royal <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Constabulary - that we should rely for the maintenance of law and order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be that as it may, if the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> reacts in a strong manner we ought not to be the first to rush in and criticise it because of its stern intentions to maintain law and order and its international reputation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this respect the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Loans Guarantee Bill is vitally important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth of Australia will sustain the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> into the future by guaranteeing the loans that have already been  underwritten from the Asian <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that it will be our responsibility well into the future to stand beside the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and help them convince the international banking authorities that their proposals for the future and their projects for development are in fact banking propositions in the international sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here again not only the Minister for External Territories but also some of us in this Parliament who have had experience of the operations of international financial bodies are aware of the fact that almost all of the qualities of native wit and ingenuity will be called upon for demonstration by Ministers in the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to deal with that part of the Minister’s second reading speech on ;he <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By agreement with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, defence and foreign relations will remain reserved to Australia until independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have given this matter a lot of consideration and thought, and as it is 31 years since I and the honourable member for Wimmera first i”t foot on to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> it will be readily understood that we have a degree of emotional association with the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the visit to the Territory by the delegation from the Australian Parliament we took some of the younger members of the delegation to the war cemeteries in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in Australia ought to be able to avoid circumstances of that nature if we are prepared to enter into contractual arrangements with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> at the time of independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> needs every bawbee’, every dollar, it has for spending on roads, schools, hospitals and education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our own interests we ought to encourage <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to do that to the utmost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice, as the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock)  said that no pattern has been laid down for the future relations between the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> defence force and the Commonwealth of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not at all concerned about that situation because it encourages me to believe that the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, during the year or so prior to independence and in the years following independence, will be loath to spend money on military equipment and also to believe that the Australian people prefer to be in the position where they are able to recognise, in some way or another - perhaps by some mutual defence treaty or agreement - that we will be prepared to look after the external relations of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> conjointly in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my hope that this is the sort of thing that will develop within the relations between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was delighted that the Japan-Australia negotiations were accompanied by visits to Japan by the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>,  Mr Somare,  and other members of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear to everybody that Japan will be one country in Asia which will be vitally interested in the future development of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst other countries may be interested in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, I believe that a great deal of developmental assistance will come from Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we have promised to keep our remarks short, I will merely congratulate the Minister for External Territories again upon the decision to have a parliamentary delegation visit <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that it will not be the last parliamentary delegation to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in reply - I believe that it has been encouraging for all of us to see the sense of responsibility with which this House has approached what is in fact an historic act in providing for the self-government and eventual independence of the Australian colony of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We members of the Australian Labor Party, mindful of this experience, decided not this year but several years ago that our policy would be to bring <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to self-government and independence not through conflict but by the colonial power saying: ‘We believe that you have a right to make your decisions in your own way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1970 the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  as Leader of the Opposition, went to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We said then that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was ready for self-government and that independence was not that far off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time there was a change of government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and  Mr Michael  Somare became the Chief Minister in a national coalition government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had met  Mr Michael  Somare when he was in Opposition in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and we were in Opposition in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happened in 1972 was that the then Government had the presence of mind to accept the inevitability of that which we as the Labor Party in Opposition had put forward and that which the new Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> had put forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that as Australians we can all be proud that we are bringing <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to independence not through conflict or violence but through constitutional procedures in this House and in the House of Assembly of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was, I suppose, an element of shadow-sparring on the part of the Opposition, for example, concerning the extent to which we should consult with, take notice of and act in conjunction with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reiterate that all steps taken to date and all steps planned for the future have been agreed between the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the period that I have been Minister for External Territories there have been 4 substantial changes in the approved arrangements under sections 24 and 25 of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each of these changes has been at the request of and in consultation with the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have made frequent visits to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discussions have been held not only with Government leaders and leaders of the coalition, party, but also with members of the Opposition, members of the Constitutional Planning Committee and town councillors throughout the length and breadth of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have agreed in consultation with the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that there will be a 2 stage development in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in which the opportunity would be given to the Constitutional Planning Committee and, through it, the House of Assembly for a home grown constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our policy is that the date for independence will be achieved in the closest consultation with the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be subject to the endorsement of the House of Assembly /as representing the view of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Special Committee notes with satisfaction that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is making steady progress towards the achievement of the goals proclaimed in resolution 1514 (XV) and that progressive steps to this end are being taken by the administering Power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Special Committee endorses the view that the House of Assembly, as the duly elected representatives of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, in consultation with the administering Power, should decide the date for the attainment of independence of the Territory in the light of General Assembly resolution 2977 (XXVII) of 14 December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pursuant to that resolution, the Special Committee calls upon the administering Power, in consultation with the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, to prepare a timetable for independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak of  Sir Robert  Menzies who, back in I960, I think, made the observation that if there is to be independence for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> it is better sooner rather than later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The accusation has been made, somewhat lightly, I suppose, as there was not a great deal of sincerity in the viewpoint put by various speakers, that we are rushing into independence and that we are not providing sufficient opportunities and facilities for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to play its part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been our policy, it is our policy and it will continue to be our policy to give <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> an international identity not only before independence but also before self government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We as a Government have sponsored membership by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> of such international organisations as the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, the Asian Development Bank, the World Health Organisation, the South Pacific Commission and the International Labour Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have sought to encourage other countries to take an interest in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other countries such as New Zealand, Germany and Japan are discussing with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> the establishment of representation in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> ahead of independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have accepted the most urgent need for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to enter nationhood in a harmonious relationship with its neighbour, Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might recall that a Committee of this House in the previous Parliament - the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs through its Sub-Committee on Australia’s Relations with Indonesia - recorded in its report the importance of this close relationship being developed between Australia, Indonesia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the determination of the boundary between West Irian and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and in the negotiations on a border regime, the Committee recognises the importance of the active participation of the representatives of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s role in resolving these two matters is to ensure that relations between Indonesia and the new state of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are established on a firm and harmonious basis and that Australia in discharging its responsibilities maintains the respect of and cordial relations with both countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, on assuming responsibility for this portfolio, I immediately put arrangements in hand and the border between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Indonesia has now been delineated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discussions are taking place this very day in Djakarta on the border arrangements between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and West Irian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the primary responsibilities and tasks of this aid agency will be continuing assistance to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have accepted the special relationship between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By this commitment to a timetable for assistance, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be in a better position to plan its own development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have stated also that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will have first call on Australia’s foreign aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We accept the responsibility to ensure that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is in a position to develop for the good of its own people in the way that the elected representatives of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and not of Australia, should so decide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have made it very clear that, in this period, we will operate in the closest consultation with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might point out to honourable gentlemen opposite that it was because of their complete neglect and their complete incompetence that the Minister for Defence  (Mr Barnard)  and I have had to put a great deal of effort into ensuring a sensible program in the defence relationships between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has been gravely at fault in delaying so long a separation of the armed forces in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from those of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We called it the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Defence Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This re-designation parade is an important and historic occasion in the development of the armed forces of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and of the identification of the forces within the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had these discussions with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> through the Minister for Defence as a result of his visit there within the first month - in January - of assuming office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these discussions with the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> it was agreed that consultations on defence matters would commence in March between officials of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have made it our firm view - our firm conviction: - that the ultimate decision concerning <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s defence capability, its structure and role will rest with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our role in these consultations has been to advise and to assist in the decision making processes and to bring to the attention of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> authorities all factors relevant to the formulation of a suitable defence policy for an .independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So all the questions of organisation, role, size, localisation and training of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Defence Force is now a matter for close and continuing consultation with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact in May 1973 the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government issued policy guidelines in proceeding with the defence arrangements after the achievment of independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Defence has been in close consultation with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and we are convinced that this is the right way to proceed because the nature of the Defence Force for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is primarily a matter for the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government itself to decide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe these ministerial arrangements are a measure of the degree of forward planning for which this Government has been responsible in the approach to this very important matter of the independence of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this period between selfgovernment and independence there will be a Minister Assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs in regard to matters affecting <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will assume the responsibility for Australia’s relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the importance that we attach to the smooth transfer, the Minister Assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs in regard to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> matters will be given the responsibility for coordinating all the matters relating to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other Ministers who have statutory responsibility in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, such as the Minister for Defence, have been asked by the Prime Minister to consult with the Minister Assisting in discharging their own responsibilities so as to ensure adequate coordination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The High Commissioner in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be appointed as at 1 December 1973 to take the place of the office of the present Administrator and during the self-government period he will be responsible to the Minister Assisting for all the matters undertaken by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I pointed out in my second reading speech, these are historic Bills but I believe that with the co-operation of all groups within Australia, with the continuing cooperation of the Government, the House of Assembly and the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> we can bring about an orderly transfer of authority from a colonial power to its former colony. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One needs only to compare the actions of this Government in relation to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> with the paternalistic attitude that is now shown by the Minister towards these 2 areas to justify what I am saying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Government forced <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> along the road to self-government and independence at a speed at which the people of that country did not want to travel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using a word that the Minister used so freely in his speech, I refer to the hypocrisy of the attitude of this Government when one sees what it is doing in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by speeding it to selfgovernment and independence and compare that with the callous attitude of the Minister towards the people of these 2 Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Banking Bill is one of 4 Australian Bills required to transfer the responsibility for the control and supervision of banking in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and its authorities and to pave the way for the establishment of a separate <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> banking system and central bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present the Australian Government’s legislation, namely the Reserve Bank Act, the Banking Act and the Commonwealth Banks Act, extends to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and, accordingly, the responsibility for control and supervision of banking in that country rests with the Australian Government and, in particular, with the Reserve Bank of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of these Bills will be to withdraw the application of this Australian legislation to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> at a date to be agreed with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and to facilitate the transfer of responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will also open the way for the development of a banking and financial system appropriate to the particular needs and circumstances of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and will ensure control by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the planning of future developments in these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The development of a separate banking system for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was the subject of a detailed examination by a committee of Australian and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government officials established by the previous Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of that committee, which was tabled in the Australian Parliament on 29 August 1973, was accepted in principle by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government as a suitable basis for action to establish a separate banking system in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principles on which the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> banking system is to be established were set out in a joint Press statement which was issued by the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Morrison),  the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Minister for Finance and myself in April 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those principles include: That responsibility for control of banks and financial institutions operating in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> be vested in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> authorities as soon as practicable; that a central bank be established in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on the basis of the Port Moresby office of the Reserve Bank of Australia and be endowed with a full range of powers to act as a central monetary authority for a separate banking system, even though some of these powers could not be usedin the immediate future; that a national banking institution be established in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> through the setting up of a new <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government commercial bank; and that except where certain accounts give rise to special contractual or financial problems the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> business of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation be transferred to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government Commercial Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These principles are embodied in 2 ordinances relating to banking which have recently been passed by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first of these ordinances is the Central Banking Ordinance which authorises the establishment of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s own central bank to be called the Bank of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government included in its grant to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> this financial year financial assistance to help in the establishment of this new central bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government has indicated its intention, if possible, to bring these 2 ordinances into force on 1 November 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the Australian banking legislation extends at present to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government can bring these ordinances into operation only when the application of the Australian banking legislation to that country is withdrawn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend to the House this Banking Bill, designed to allow the withdrawal of the application of the Australian Banking Act to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and the other associated Bills which I am introducing concurrently to facilitate the establishment of a separate banking system in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is related to the agreement outlined in my joint Press statement in April 1973 that, subject to further consideration of particular aspects, the greater part of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> business of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation be transferred to a new <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government Commercial Bank which is to be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I indicated in the paper ‘Australia’s External Aid 1973-74’ which was presented on the occasion of my 1973-74 Budget Speech, a payment of $15m will be made to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government in 1973-74 to facilitate the establishment of this proposed Government Commercial Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I indicated in introducing the Banking Bill, this Bill is to facilitate the establishment of a separate banking system in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> subject to local control and with its own central bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also provides for the transfer of certain assets and liabilities from the Commonwealth Banking Corporation to the proposed new <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government owned commercial bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision relating to the Reserve Bank comes in force from the date that the Reserve Bank Act ceases to apply to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for certain business of the Commonwealth Trading Banks and the Commonwealth Savings Bank in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to be transferred to the proposed new <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government commercial bank with any necessary settlement to be effective on terms agreed between the 2 Governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certain accounts of the Commonwealth Trading Bank giving rise to special contractual or financial problems will not be transferred to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Bank and this business will be conducted at a special branch of the Commonwealth Trading Bank opened for that purpose and which will be excluded from the transfer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee has been unable to visit the island because of a request not to do so, because discussions were continuing between islander councils and representatives of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> regarding the definition of the border in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The  chairman  will be  Dr Kenneth  McKinnon, who for many years was the Director of Education in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, who created a very large part of the secondary and teacher education aspects which have been the most marked development of education in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>This will facilitate the transfer of the greater part of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> business of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation to a new <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government Commercial Bank which is to be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Reserve Bank Bill 1973 provides for the withdrawal of the application of the Reserve Bank Act to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In short, the objective of the 4 Bills before the House is to transfer the control and supervision of banking in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and to pave the way for the establishment of a separate <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> banking system and central bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under the existing legislation the responsibility for the control and supervision of banking in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> resides of course with the Australian Government, and in particular with the Reserve Bank of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are aware that the provisions of the Bills have the complete support of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government with which appropriately the details have been subject to full and detailed discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We recognise that it is the wish of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government to bring into force on 1 November 1973 the Central Banking Ordinance and the Banks and Financial Institutions Ordinance, ‘both of which have been recently passed by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bills before the House which provide for a separate <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> banking system, will facilitate the development of a banking and financial system appropriate to the policies of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and will ensure control by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the future development in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have pointed out in this House the inconsistencies of the Labor Party’s foreign policy - how  it  has insulted the Americans, the British and the Singaporeans, and confused the Japanese, the Indonesians and the Filipinos and created apprehension and fear in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many people in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> had been wrongly led to believe that self-government and independence would mean that Australia would be getting out and leaving <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the lurch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The normal grant aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in 1973-74 will be $127m compared with $119,500,000 in 1972-73. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This aid will assist the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government to finance important development projects as well as to complement vital services such as education, public health, and law and order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, $51m has been provided for projects, in the main non-recurring, which are essential to the smooth handover and transfer of powers to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A total of $17m will be available to assist in the establishment of a <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Central Bank and a government commercial bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other special aid items include S 1,650,000 for the construction of a new runway and associated work at Port Moresby airport; $lm for the cultural development program; and $5m for direct expenditure by Australian departments in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A large item in our aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is for emoluments of the Australians who were appointed to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service by the Australian Government and whose services will be required after selfgovernment and independence until Papua New Guineans are ready to take their places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is in practice self-governing and only awaits amendment to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act to become formally self-governing, it is interesting to recall the origin of Australia’s policy for the development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nearly 28 years ago a former Minister for External Territories,  Mr Eddie  Ward, when introducing the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Provisional Administration Bill, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian economic aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for the past 10 years was provided largely as backing for development based on the concepts of a World Bank Mission of 1963. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the Mission’s basic principles was that expenditure and manpower should be concentrated in areas and on activities where the prospective return was highest and this meant that the benefits of development did not reach quite a large number of Papua New Guineans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government is now rightly concerned about this and the present inequalities between rural and urban populations, between expatriates and Papua New Guineans, between Papua New Guineans and between districts within the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new plan - the basic plan - is to improve the lives of all Papua New Guineans, not merely to increase the gross national product. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government is happy to support this basic purpose of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government with an assurance of continuing economic aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our aid program for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be developed in cooperation and consultation with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has always been Australia’s aim that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should, as soon as possible, achieve a much greater degree of financial and economic viability than it now has, but the Australian Government has given the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government an assurance that, it is prepared to continue providing substantial aid not only up to independence but also beyond. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The degree of economic stability that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has achieved is such that it was able to overcome the acute problems of the past 12 months caused by the laying off of workers on completion of the construction phase of the Bougainville copper project, the very low world prices for rural products and the effect of the rearrangement of exchange rates of its trading partners and exports competitors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot be denied that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will still face difficult problems as do all other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important difference is that the decisions affecting <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are now being made by the elected representatives of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Government, and I am sure that here I can speak on behalf of the Opposition, have every reason for confidence that the Government which has emerged in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has the ability to carry the country forward to viable nationhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He remains, I understand, as Minister for Science and will be looking after <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s welfare on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been mentioned by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the coming of self-government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and our continuing commitment to maintain substantial aid to that country, it is essential that our aid programs are rationally determined and efficiently administered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make these points about Australia’s relationship with Indonesia: There have been harmonious conclusions to the negotiations on the border between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Indonesia since the Australian Labor Government took office on 2 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless this Parliament is prepared to look after those who have served this country and the development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, I believe that our responsibilities as parliamentarians will not have been met properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been maligned for our handling of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recent statement by the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Morrison)  regarding the independence timetable clearly shows that, despite our eagerness to give an early opportunity for self-government and independence in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, we are keenly aware of the need to co-operate with those whose responsibility it will be to effect the completion of the task. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to make some comments about <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and one or two comments about the general issue of foreign affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turning to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, with which the Minister has a very special relationship, I would like to say that as from 1 December, as has been already said to the House by the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock),  there will be a substantial change in the responsibilities of the Minister’s Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister will be operating under the Minister for Foreign Affairs and looking after the special relationships between the Australian Government and the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the ways in which I believe this can be done, particularly in view of the propaganda that is going on at the present time about the world’s energy problems, is to invite or influence the Government in Port Moresby to try to accelerate the exploration programs that are being carried out within <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in an effort to identify the ore bodies, to find oil and to develop the resources of that nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If United States know-how through companies of this nature can be encouraged to an even greater degree to come to the Territory there may be some possibility of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> more quickly reaching the stage where it will be able to develop its own programs and to stand to a greater degree than ever before on its own feet in terms of financial assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe Australians should have the courage, at least in relation to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, to face the future and say: ‘We will stand with you and by some formal contract we will undertake to look after your defence, internally and externally, over the next 15 years’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can see no earthly reason why we should have to apologise to anyone of any colour anywhere else, in any government in the world or in the United Nations, for our particular interest in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and our particular obligation to see that that country is developed and preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have mentioned previously the contribution that was made by the delegation from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the maturity that was shown by its leader and members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He explained that most of this increase would occur in relation to aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and that it relates to that country’s movement towards self-government and independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the various external economic aid programs undertaken by Australia to assist developing countries, including <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, is, of course, to assist those countries to attain more rapid economic growth and higher living standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not oppose the move to grant selfgovernment to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on 1 December next. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in regard to independence for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> I believe that Australia should not fix the date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do agree, though, that Australia must be prepared to continue for quite some time in the future to provide financial aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as a near neighbour with whom we will all want to remain on friendly terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expenditure on our bilateral aid programs - excluding <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> - is estimated to increase by just over $6m in the current year to a total of nearly $67m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the right honourable member for Higgins  (Mr Gorton)  and the honourable member for Robertson  (Mr Cohen)  will pardon me if I move away from the theme of the Middle East and return to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which we were discussing earlier in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to put on the record of the Committee, in relation to future defence relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the words of Professor J. D. B. Miller who, earlier this year, had this to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has been gravely at fault in delaying so long the separation of the armed forces in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from those of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frantic efforts are being made to separate them out, but it is proving a much harder task than it would have been even a few years ago: as the Australian defence organisation has grown more complex, so have run deeper the roots which have to be pulled up in order to make a <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> defence organisation a separate body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The forces in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should have been under the control of the local Administrator and accounted for in the local budget, even if we put up most of the money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now everything has to be done in a hurry, and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, which has never had to pay for its armed forces, is faced with the prospect either of paying for them all of a sudden, which would be financially ruinous, or of getting rid of  them, which might be socially disastrous, or of asking the former colonial power to pay for them, which is potentially troublesome from a political standpoint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am thus suggesting that Australia will need to face the preparation of both a general independence treaty and a defence agreement, the terms of which should be worked out with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> government and publicised in both countries so that people can digest them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, for example, we do not have a clear and precise defence agreement which describes the circumstances in which Australia would be prepared to consider a <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> government’s call for armed intervention, say in a case similar to the East African mutinies in 1964 or in the event of regional insurgency, we shall be in real trouble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Personally, I want these occasions to be as few as possible, and I do not want Australia to police <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>; but misunderstandings are much less likely if the possibilities are spelled out beforehand than if they are left in a fog. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government, in the Senate on 24 October, introduced an amendment to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>2) 1973 extends the qualifications of persons who may be appointed as judges of the Supreme Court of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As explained in my second reading speech, this provision is made at the request of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and will enable <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to call on overseas expertise for as long as it takes its own legal profession to provide a sufficient number of judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is done by amending the Seventh Schedule to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act 1949- 1973 which is in the form of the oath of affirmation required by section 59 (2) of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill will also extend the withholding tax provisions of the income tax law to dividends and interest flowing from Australia to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which have, up to now, been taxed on an assessment basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rate of dividends paid to residents of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be 15 per cent, the same rate as is imposed by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on dividends flowing to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The withholding tax will be payable on dividends and interest paid to residents of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, including companies, after today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This income will no longer be included in assessable income and the rebate on inter-company dividends will no longer be available to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has withdrawn a corresponding rebate from Australian companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further investigations have shown that ‘Repository’ companies in other countries, and especially in tax havens, would be used for the purpose of avoiding Australian tax if the new rules were applied only to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I understand it, it was not until the Chief Minister actually pleaded with the Prime Minister that  Mr Maori  Kiki was allowed to go and so <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> still remains a blot on the Government’s diplomatic initiatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Using the basis of calculation proposed by the working group, the costs attributable to the maintenance and operation of civil aviation airports and airways facilities in Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> during 1972-73 exceeded the relevant revenues by some $69m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The nub of the matter that I wish to raise is that women who did the same war work as men, in the same place, wearing even the same clothes, do not get the same housing benefits even if their work was in a war zone, such as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The women acted as flight mechanics, transport drivers and cooks doing precisely the same sort of work as men and, often, as I say, in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> working under the same dangers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is concerned, we have had numerous changes of direction and stated attitudes by Ministers of this Government leading to the most extraordinary uncertainties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the commencement of this year the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Morrison)  boasted that the Labor Government would make <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> independent by 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was forcibly and publicly challenged by the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and told that this was primarily a decision for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We then had the dogmatic statement by the Minister for Civil Aviation  (Mr Charles Jones)  that he would dictate the terms of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s national airline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Ministers thoroughly disagreed with this assessment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Later the Prime Minister at first refused to allow <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s Defence and Foreign Relations Minister,  Mr Albert  Maori Kiki, to travel with the Australian delegation to Japan and to participate in discussions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The period of Labor administration of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has revealed a record of misconceived intent, confusion of policy and a regrettable continuing state of convulsive colonialism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In contrast, the Liberal Party’s policy towards <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was and is clear and unexceptionable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the country of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, it is their future and they should be the determinants of that future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman then referred to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Labor Party which identified the legitimate claims by the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to self government and independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year the then Prime Minister did not introduce the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>,  Mr Somare  it was left to the honourable gentleman who has raised this matter of public importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this time the Prime Minister of Australia fully involved the Foreign Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the discussions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is important that not only in our relations with Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines, but also in our developing relations with the about-to-be independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, we should pursue a policy that maintains the line that has been so well and effectively presented for so long - the concept of regional security, which we should not forsake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second visit the Prime Minister paid overseas was to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and he then went on to Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions relating to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> seek to prevent tax evasion by Australian private companies through the payment of such companies of dividends to special repository’ companies set up in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, where undistributed profits tax is not levied on private companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill will make dividends paid by an Australian private company to a private ‘repository’ company resident in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> ineligible to be counted as a dividend for the purpose of calculating whether the Australian company has a liability for undistributed profits tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will not affect dividends paid to a <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> company in circumstances, as defined in the Bill, which do not involve tax avoidance, <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>expenditure on exploration or prospecting for gold on any mining tenements in Australia or <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> incurred by the taxpayer during the period from the commencement of the year of income that began on 1 July 1963 to the end of the year of income that ended on 30 June 1973; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions that I propose to be omitted from the Bill would, with effect from the commencement of the 1973-74 income year, have withdrawn the outright exemption from income tax of profits earned from mining for gold in Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the exemption of one-fifth of the profits earned from mining prescribed metals or minerals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have seen the reports and on a visit to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> I saw the farms to which the honourable senator has referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In his second reading speech on the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Provisional Administration Bill on 4 July 1945, the then Labor Government Minister for External Territories,  Mr Eddie  Ward, observed: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 2 days time <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will have full legal control over its own internal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has attained self-government and is moving to independence by orderly constitutional procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party, having noted the reluctance of colonial powers to give up their colonies - a reluctance which led to wars of national liberation, subversion and bloodshed - was determined that the distresing lessons of history should not be repeated in Australia’s colony - <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will want to measure their own steps and to set their own course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The National Coalition Government, under the leadership of  Mr Michael  Somare, has already re-oriented the economic and social development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in line with the 8-Point Improvement Program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia will, as the Prime Minister has stated publicly and unequivocally, continue to provide assistance to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> up to independence and beyond. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not leave <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the lurch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The assistance will be applied to the objectives and priorities established by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government, in acknowledging this, has ranked self-reliance as one of its major objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government recognises that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will continue to occupy a special position in Australia’s policy, but we do not see Australia as seeking or asserting an exclusive relationship with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will want to find its own place in the international community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attainment of self-government for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is also the occasion for the disbandment of the Department of External Territories whose staff has worked tirelessly and with dedication in the interests of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the many thousands of Australians who have served and are serving in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, we extend our appreciation for their contribution to the development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is still a great need for the Australian Government to draw on the training, experience and knowledge gained by its public servants in handling matters related to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and I trust that full and intelligent use will be made of this asset in the coming years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>too early for an historical judgment to be made on what Australia has done in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That,  Sir, is  a compliment - I believe a well earned compliment - by  His Excellency,  who, for many years, was the Minister for Territories and in charge of the affairs of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for the Government of his day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it would be appropriate for this House, in taking note of a landmark in its own history, to express to the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> through the House of Assembly its warm wishes in the form of a resolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The orderly and peaceful transition of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to self-government on 1 December this year may be regarded, to a large extent, as a tribute to the policies of the previous Liberal-Country Party Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The date was agreed upon last year by the Liberal-Country Party Government of Australia and the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attainment of self government is also a tribute to successive Australian Administrators and to the officers of the Department of External Territories, both in Canberra and in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, as well as the officers of other departments which have contributed to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s progress towards self government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s task in the past has been to carry out the United Nations mandate to advance the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> politically, economically and socially to the position where they could run their own affairs and to do this in accordance with the wishes of the people expressed through their elected representatives in the House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, to all intents and purposes, now run their own affairs and Australia has nearly completed its task. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A major step in this constitutional advance occurred in April 1972 with the election of the present House of Assembly and the exercising of increasingly greater responsibilities since then by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this I merely wish to say today that the prime determinant of the date of independence must be the desire of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as expressed by the leadership group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> must determine that date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has long held the view that there should be a smooth and orderly transition which establishes <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by the time of independence as a state able to manage its own affairs with a government responsive to the wishes of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In most areas of government <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is now responsible for the evolution of policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are uniquely qualified for this responsibility, since only they have a fundamental understanding of the fabric of life in their own country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, in determining such priorities, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> now makes the decisions, but Australia and Australians with the necessary expertise still have a role to play in advising, not directing, policies - if our advice is sought - and of helping, not hindering, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From this Saturday, 1 December, in the period between self government and independence the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be responsible for all domestic matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Between 1 December and independence Australia will be dealing with defence and foreign affairs matters on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and its people but also in conjunction wim them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This pattern of cooperation was initiated under the previous Liberal-Country Party Government when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was represented, for example, at the first talks of the AustraliaJapan Ministerial Committee last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recent creation of the portfolio of Defence and Foreign Relations in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the appointment to it of a Papua New Guinean Minister,  Mr Albert  Maori Kiki, is proper recognition of the fact that Australia will retain reserve powers in foreign affairs and defence only until <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is fully independent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be remiss if we found ourselves completing the independence of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> without adequate preparation for the post-independence world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need to look beyond <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s independence to the future relationship and to the form of the future relationship between the 2 countries is urgent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be our closest foreign neighbour; we will be her closest but not her only source of aid and expertise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On Australia’s part, as long as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> looks to Australia for aid, it is the declared intention of both the Government and the Opposition parties in the Australian Parliament to provide such aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although it is desirable that Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should have a special relationship and that Australia in’ particular should not lag in fostering that relationship, Australian policies and those of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> need not necessarily always be in tandem, nor should they be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is necessary to distinguish between Australia’s relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s own foreign relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to determine our relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> with proper regard to Australia’s own national interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should expect <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to do the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the relationship between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> also will be a part of their broader relations - collectively and separately - with the countries of the South Pacific and with other countries in Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, with its  2i  million citizens and its economic potential, will be a nation of consequence in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> also will have a major interest in South East Asia, sharing a land border with Indonesia and already developing a relationship of economic interdependence with Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While Australia will remain important to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, we should not seek to build an exclusive relationship based on a mistaken belief that past assistance places <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> under an obligation to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looked at from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s point of view, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Japan, as well as the island nations of the Pacific, will have important places in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other Governments will be seeking to assist <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not to do so might adversely affect both our and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s relations with third countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through close consultation with one another, Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> could begin now to formulate policies which will make more fruitful our relationship and theirs with both the Asian and the Pacific regions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is significant that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s attainment of self-government is acclaimed by all parties in the Australian Parliament and is endorsed not only here but also in the Commonwealth and the ‘United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In both these international forums it is expected that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, on the attainment of independence will take its rightful place as a sovereign nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, may I say that during my period as Minister for External Territories I tried to convey an understanding of trust between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, in particular a trust between myself, the Chief Minister and his Ministers, to ensure that the Chief Minister realised at all times that when one spoke of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> one spoke not just of a country but of its people, and that as fellow human beings we should jointly seek a ‘better life and a better relationship between our peoples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I join with the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Morrison),  speaking as the Minister for External Territories in this Parliament for the last time, and his predecessor, the former Minister for External Territories, the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock),  in endorsing on behalf of the Australian Country Party the message to be conveyed to the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> through the House of Assembly of warm wishes on the occasion of their self-government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the relationships that have evolved between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> it is that quality above all others which has distinguished the successive relationships at a ministerial level, at a parliamentary level and at a personal level between Australians, Papuans and New Guineans both in peace and at war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 1 December a significant event will occur not only for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> but for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The relationship between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is almost as close as that personal one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been a personal involvement not only by those who are today in this Parliament and in the House of Assembly in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> but also by those who have been in the Ministry or in the Department of External Territories over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in particular to  Sir Paul  Hasluck and to  Mr Barnes,  I think, the credit must go for the capacity of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to take the step which tomorrow represents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Minister said in his statement in the House today that he believes it was the visit to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> of the Australian Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  that served as a catalyst for change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me it is regrettable that there should have been that type of visit at a time when, through a progressive support of the actions and the initiatives of which the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> were capable, there had been a remarkable transition from a state of complete dependence on Australia to a state in which economically the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> were more and more able to sustain their own future development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was that confidence in the future which was unfortunately so violently disrupted by the actions and statements of the present Prime Minister as Leader of the Opposition when he visited <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in 1970 and 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I believe that it is important that, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> having attained selfgovernment, the good will that has been in existence between our 2 countries is preserved during this next transition stage in the move towards independence and in the period thereafter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that there be no feeling on the part of the Government, the Parliament or the people of Australia that we will force upon the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> decisions which they themselves do not desire to take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would hope that in this transition to independence a capacity is developed within the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which will enable them to accept the greater responsibilities which the final step will involve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that their contribution to the self-government and to the status of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> must be a great tribute to their own personal efforts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To Michael Somare, the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and to his parliamentarians the responsibility for the future is now passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in Michael Somare and his Ministry there is the capacity for the guidance of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the future in a sound and constructive way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To all those in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, to those in the House of Assembly, on behalf of the Australian Country Party I wish the very best for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe it is a motion which will lead not towards the severance of relations between our 2 countries but rather to the fostering of a closer and a permanent relationship which will give to both the people of Australia and the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> greater promise for tomorrow than might otherwise have been the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Honourable W. L. Morrison, Minister for Science, will also be Minister Assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 19 July 1972 the former Treasurer foreshadowed legislative measures to curtail tax avoidance with respect to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, Norfolk Island, Cocos Islands and Christmas Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It further provides for the Minister, as defined, to delegate all of his powers under the Act to a Minister of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government, who is further empowered by this clause to exercise those powers independently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also takes a further step in the transfer of power to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by enabling the Minister for Foreign Affairs to delegate his powers under this Act to the appropriate Minister in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government who may exercise those powers independently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The present Administrative Arrangements Order provides that the Special Minister of State shall administer the Continental Shelf (Living Natural Resources) Act with respect to the external territories of Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island and that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will administer the Act so far as it relates to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As from 1 November 1973 responsibility for the operation of internal air services in PapuaNew Guinea was assumed by Niugini, the national airline of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither TAA nor ATI now operate any air services in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in their own right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, there was no interruption to the movement of passengers and goods on air routes in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are surplus Commonwealth goods in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> sent back to Australia for disposal; if not, how are they disposed of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surplus Australian Government owned goods in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, including equipment from the Services, are not normally returned to Australia for disposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Items foi disposal in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are first used to satisfy local government or institutional requirements with the balance being sold either by public tender or auction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>(2)-(4) Assistance in training labour administrators in Australia is already available under SPAP (South Pacific Aid Program),CPTS (Commonwealth Practical Training Scheme), in the case of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and under ILO fellowships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-154">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have just come from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> where I saw at first hand the progress there in this period of self government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740228_reps_28_hor88/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Government will seek a timetable for independence for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in consultation and agreement with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and subject to the endorsement of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740228_reps_28_hor88/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Much of this lending has gone to developing countries of interest to Australia in the Asian and Pacific regions, including <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will be aware that as an interim measure, pending legislation, and in order to provide for continuity in our aid arrangements with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, administrative arrangements were made to bring together from 1 December last the aid work for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and aid matters handled by the Department of Foreign Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our aid for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has risen very sub stantially over the years and will continue at a high level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable members will know we have undertaken to provide a united <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> at least $500m over the next 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Up to December 1973, the Department of External Territories administered aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the inadequacy of these arrangements, in March of last year I commissioned a task force ‘to examine all the options for a unified administration to administer all aid, including multilateral aid, all bilateral aid and aid to an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The existing structure involving dispersal of aid functions among several departments needs to be substantially reviewed in the light of the increased complexities and sophistication of development assistance and to accommodate the administration of aid to an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to say that the decision has been welcomed by the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>,  Mr Somare,  who has said that he looks forward to a fruitful and friendly relationship with the Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is on the tracks to independence and it is being financially supported by this Government so that it can achieve its ends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: In view of the Chief Minister foreshadowing an independence date for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, what are the Prime Minister’s intentions for the non-self governing territory of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will be aware that the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>,  Mr Somare,  announced in the House of Assembly on 12 March that it was the intention of his Government to move in the April sittings of the House for independence for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on 1 December 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government welcomes the initiative of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government in seeking the endorsement of the House to this date and fully supports  Mr Somare  and his Government in this move. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United Nations in its resolution of 12 December 1973 noted that ‘the House of Assembly has affirmed its right as the duly elected Parliament of the People of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to decide when independence is to come and that the administering power accepts that the House of Assembly represents the wishes of the people on the question of independence’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is not only self governing but virtually independent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have explained to honourable members on previous occasions, steps have already been taken before self-government to enable <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to assume an international identity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increasing recognition of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s international status is indicated by the number of foreign consulates that have already, ahead of independence, been established in Port Moresby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been, as honourable members are aware, increasingly involved in the field of defence and Australia has fully consulted it on all aspects of defence policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A senior Minister in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government,  Mr Albert  Maori-Kiki, is responsible for defence matters as well as for foreign relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Short of independence Australia must retain authority in these fields, but it has been the Australian Government’s policy to devolve steadily increasing responsibility to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, with the concurrence of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and consistently with the retention of ultimate authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the experience which <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has gained in the exercise of these responsibilities will stand the country in good stead in the years after independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia also endorses  Mr Somare’s  statement that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has all the prerequisites of an independent country and has the manpower and economic resources to continue its development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is backing <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s potential by giving positive manpower and financial support to underpin <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s improvement program and to assist in the early years of independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable members will be aware, the Prime Minister has informed the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government that on the basis of present indications, a united <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> could proceed on the assumption that the Australian Government will provide a total of at least $500m for its expenditure on economic and social development in one form or another over the 3-year period beginning 1974-1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the commitment is to underpin the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government’s new improvement program and to assist <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the early years after independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to another matter, the question of a proposed constitution for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Constitutional Planning Committee recently announced in the House of Assembly a revised timetable for the presentation of the Committee’s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Somare  in referring to the proposed independence date on 1 December has stated that it will give the House ample time to debate fully and to enact a <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> home grown Constitution to guide it after independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem appropriate that a <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> home grown Constitution should come into effect at independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When appropriate, Australia, as required by the United Nations, will commence discussions with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government to determine a timetable for the transfer of the remaining powers and the necessary administrative and legislative action which will flow from that transfer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will also need to have discussions with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government about our approach to the United Nations in regard to the discharge of the trusteeship arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the final arbiters regarding the decision of a date for independence should be the members of the House of Assembly in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout our period in Opposition I have consistently pointed to the consistent policy of the Liberal Party when in Government that the decision on the date for independence must not rest with this Parliament but with the Parliament in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief Minister has indicated, by foreshadowing a motion, that during April or May the matter will be fully discussed and debated and the decision will be taken by the elected leaders of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the House of Assembly, and we welcome that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, on ‘behalf of the Liberal Party since we have been in Opposition and following the viewpoints that I expressed when previously I was Minister for External Territories, I said that not only did we have a duty to ensure the smooth and orderly transition through self-government to independence in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, but also we had a basic duty to ensure that both <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia fully understood the nature of the relationship in a post-independence situation; that it would not be good enough to arrive at a date for independence and pass through it and then start discussions on the nature of the relationship between the then independent country of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that insufficient has been done regarding the post-independent relationship between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Public servants who are serving the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government are hardpressed as it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to those serving in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> office within the present Department of Foreign Affairs, there should have been an additional cell which was operating specifically on postindependence relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is the Minister for Defence  (Mr Barnard)  who is culpable to the Australian nation for not advising this Parliament and the Australian people of what steps have been taken to determine the size, structure and role of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> defence forces during this period of self-government prior to independence when I would remind honourable members that we are still internationally responsible and answerable to the United Nations for matters of internal security but particularly of defence security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not need to dwell on the circumstances of the need for the Pacific Islands Regiment as an element within the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Defence Forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Parliament has not been informed by the Minister for Defence at any time on what he views as the role of those officers in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> defence forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think I need justify my firm belief and confidence in the stability of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By intruding these views regarding the role of the defence forces in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> during this period I in no way imply that they could be misused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has delayed decisions in consultation with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as to what their role will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He ignored the constitutional right of the Government of Queensland and he seemed to pay little heed to the nature of the requests made by the politicians in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Papua New Guineans will not insist on having this matter clarified, it is deluding itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take note that there will be some in the independent country of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> - if they decide that 1 December is to be their date for independence - who will not tolerate dogmatic views that this Government with a stroke of a pen can change these boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be no blame on the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think most people would not need to read much between the lines to know my view on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s independence does come, it will signify the last step in a long process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we were in government we ensured, and this Government also has ensured - I compliment it in this area - that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been practised in governing and has been able to call on the resources, human and otherwise, that are a necessary part of an orderly and developing nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the period of self government when the previous Government was still in control of certain areas, Ministers in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> were the prime motivators of change rather than the Australian Government and that is how it should have been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust that the Government will continue to do so and will ensure, as I said, as far as possible that no decision affecting <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is taken without full consultation with the Government of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we were in government we hoped to arrive at a situation prior to independence where, because of the progressive involvement of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> leaders in the whole range of government activities and responsibilities there would be no sphere in which the newly independent country would find itself unfamiliar or lacking experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I doubt whether many people would question that Australia and an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will have a mutual interest in maintaining what is a unique and special relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government, as the Minister pointed out, has announced Australia’s intention to continue aid to an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for the foreseeable future, both financially and, of course, in the provision of experts and training if this is requested by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Factors of geography alone have dictated that our 2 countries are too important each to the other to ignore the historical links that have been forged in the course of our administration of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should this resolution go through, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will become our closest foreign neighbour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until the fairly recent past <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been, except for coastal areas, free from outside contacts and influences in many ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of New Guinea have, particularly over the last 18 months through their leadership group, been taking an increasing interest in developments in South East Asia - to an even greater extent than in Australia - in that to the west of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and sharing a common land border is part of the largest of the countries of that region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this, if for no other reason, relations with Indonesia will inevitably occupy a special place for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act that we will have to ensure that there is an orderly legislative movement towards independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am talking about both sides in Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that both the Liberal Party and the Country Party will do all in their power to ensure that the unique and special relationship between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> continues irrespective of the manner in which the movement is taken towards independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The timing of the transition from self government to independence is a matter for the House of Assembly and the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Governments, and parties on both sides of this House, however, have rightly seen the necessity for the transition of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as soon as possible to independence, the date for which has been proclaimed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one who has been interested in and concerned with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for many years I think I must express a fear that there is still so much to be done; a fear that in the short time left before <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> takes the final step there are perhaps many areas which will not be adequately completed to enable <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as an independent country to have as easy a transition as we would wish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet I think it should be said of both my colleague the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock),  who has just spoken, and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs in matters relating to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>  (Mr Morrison),  that each in his own way, as have successive Administrators of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as well as the expatriate public servants who worked first for the Department of External Territories and now within its current role as a sub-department of the Prime Minister’s Department, have done their utmost to ensure that the deficiencies have been overcome and the educative processes have been effectively achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first that worries me is the degree to which there have been between the Government of Australia and the now self governing body that controls <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> discussions about the way in which relations in the areas remaining to be resolved could be concluded before independence is achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first area is the role of the Regiment which operates in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and which was initially entirely under Australian control and command but which has a progression through the ranks of indigenous Papuans and New Guineans and which until independence will still remain the responsibility of the Government of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is most tragic that there has not been a meaningful discussion between the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the people of the Torres Strait Islands, the Government of Queensland and the Federal Government to ensure that there could be some progress towards resolving the territorial boundaries in the Torres Strait. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe, however, that there are other issues which must be of concern to this Parliament and which today and henceforth will be the responsibility of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is our closest neighbour and a country for which we have exercised responsibility for so long, I ‘believe it behoves us to express our concern about these issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that education in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has advanced significantly in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I am concerned and have been concerned that in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, as in many other lesser developed countries, there has been a tendency to encourage education at a university level and a failure to build up the understanding that people with technical skills, with the semiskilled and skilled role that they can play in the infrastructure of the community will probably be more significant than those who have graduate or postgraduate degrees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly in terms of the development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the immediate future it is important that there be a proper balance of skilled personnel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, I believe that in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, as in many other countries, undue weight has been given to university training and the balance of incentive provided for persons to acquire job training in the various trades and the other skilled and semiskilled roles in society has not been given sufficient weight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that these deficiences will be recognised by the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and that there will be an insurance that, in the development of educational facilities in this about to be independent country, there will not be the ill consequences that seem to have befallen so many other countries moving into independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other area that concerns me - it has not been touched on although my colleague the honourable member for Kooyong briefly adverted to it - is the geographic position of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in relation to Indonesia, South East Asia and the islands of the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those island countries there is concern as to the future position of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They see <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as being so much larger than and so different from themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, in the ethnic background of their people, those island states of the Pacific have much in common with the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in its geographic lie it is important that it enjoys strong and fraternal relationships with Indonesia and all the surrounding countries of South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is able to play a role with those countries not just towards collectively developing an economic strength but towards collectively recognising the ability of each other to play an independent role - a role without intervention of neighbouring countries, a role which will enable each of these countries to give to their people the same opportunities for peace and prosperity as those who are residents of Australia enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important in the future development of relations between an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that relationships with each of the countries in this region be fostered and encouraged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One hopes that it is possible that there be maintained a very strong fraternal relationship in the evolution of foreign policy which, passing as it will from the date of independence to the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, can still involve a measure of consultation which will ensure that Australia can assist <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the formulation of the new relationships which one hopes can lead to the achievement of the objectives about which I have just spoken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ethnic divisions that exist in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the problems of communication, the divisions that are unfortunately apparent between the people of Papua and those of New Guinea and the concern that many people in several areas of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> feel about the move into independence are problems that today will and henceforth be the responsibility of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to compliment  Mr Michael  Somare, the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, for the way in which and by which he has been able to unite these different factions and differing ethnic peoples in this transition today into self-government and tomorrow into independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this fraternal relationship at a personal level is imperative at a stage where, regrettably, there is still a weakness in the infrastructures of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as it moves in this final step to independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One hopes, too, that it is not only through the members of this Parliament but also through the members of the Public Service in Australia that we can provide assistance to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> at this time of change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is in Australia a strong, friendly involvement with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who were in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> during the war perhaps feel it as strongly as today’s generation who know only of the changes that have taken place in the last 25 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I share concern about the way in which there has been meaningful negotiation to resolve the as yet unresolved problems between an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage I do not want to deal with the matters that have been raised by the  Deputy  Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Sinclair)  relating to education, improved and continuing good relations between the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am now referring of course to the position of the defence forces of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both he and the  Deputy  Leader of the Country Party  (Mr Sinclair)  consistently referred to the Pacific Island Regiment Forces in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Kooyong referred to the question of the defence forces in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and what should be the attitude of the Australian servicemen serving in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member knows, it is quite clear that since selfgovernment in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> there has been a need for consultation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has not been the prerogative of this Government to determine what should be done with the Australian defence forces in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the extent to which they should be used or integrated into the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Defence Forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a matter for consultation between the Australian Government and the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More particularly, it has been a matter for discussion between the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Minister for Defence and Foreign Relations,  Mr Kiki  and myself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, I think that probably the first visit I made outside Australia as the Minister for Defence was to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for the purpose of discussing with the then Executive Council, with  Mr Maori-Kiki  and with the Chief Minister,  Mr Somare,  the question of defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We discussed questions concerning that country in terms of defence, what the Australian attitude should be in relation to the assistance that we would provide to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the extent to which members of the Australian defence forces would continue to operate and serve in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally, the attitude that 1 adopted was that this should be the responsibility and the prerogative of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to determine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will have noted the important statement of 20 August by the Minister for Defence and Foreign Relations in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government,  Mr Kiki. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said that ‘<span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was determined to look after its own security problems in the future’ and that ‘no country can lightly contemplate either the dispatch of their own forces or the acceptance of foreign forces to deal with an essentially domestic situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australian Ministers have constantly stated that primary responsibility for the maintenance of internal security in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> rests with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> police force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, to spell it out for the honourable member for Kooyong, the Australian Government’s view remains that it would be extremely reluctant to become involved in an internal security situation in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government shares this view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the words of  Mr Kiki,  the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Minister for Defence and Foreign Relations, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was determined to look after its own security problems in the future’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely in these circumstances what one should do as a responsible Minister for Defence in the Australian Government is to ensure that there are continued discussions and negotiations with officials of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Department of Defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I indicated to the House a few moments ago, we agreed during discussions on my first visit to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that there would be continued discussions between representatives of the Australian Department of Defence and the administration in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had the opportunity on a number of occasions to discuss these matters with the Chief Minister,  Mr Somare,  together with the Minister for Science in the Australian Government and, naturally, we have had discussions which concern the internal security of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On each occasion it has been made clear to us that the responsibility for internal security in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after independence will be the responsibility of those authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in addition, we discussed the continuing aid to be provided by the Australian Department of Defence to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after independence, particularly in terms of essential equipment that would be required by that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On every occasion the proposition has been put to me as the Minister for Defence, I think responsibly and in the way that these things should be done, by the Minister for Defence of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>,  Mr Albert  Maori-Kiki. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am happy to assure the honourable member for Kooyong that those discussions were mutually advantageous and, as a result of our last discussions, Australia will take part in a continuing defence aid program for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, it has been made clear by both the Chief Minister and the Minister for Defence of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that the question of the internal security arrangements of that country will rest primarily with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> police force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, in this respect, there have been meaningful discussions on the role of the police force in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after independence and, again, assistance will be provided to that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion may I say that it is quite clear that the Australian Government has acted quite properly in meeting the wishes of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Minister for Defence and Foreign Relations and of the Chief Minister on all occasions when he has sought discussions with me on this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New Guinea Minister for Defence and Foreign Relations, it was agreed that I should visit <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the very near future - I hope to visit that country some time in April or early in May - in order that these matters might be further considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by pointing out to the honourable member for Kooyong that it would not be possible for one to make any statement in the House on what are very important matters for the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government, particularly in relation to defence and our aid program for defence to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after independence which, as I have said, will continue, until these discussions with the responsible Ministers in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> have been concluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He indicated that from my speech in the House I was not aware that he had gone to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, I think he said that the first country outside Australia which he visited was <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the personal explanation where the Minister misquoted me, he indicated to me that defence matters were now, in his viewpoint, the responsibility of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognise that we must respond primarily to the viewpoint of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been proposed that there should be some form of quadripartite arrangement between Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to get the 2 regions together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to turn now to one or two matters concerning foreign affairs in view of the fact that at the end of this year <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will become an independent country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I want to put to the House my views on what must be in effect the future relationships between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say here with great respect that this will not be the case with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has a responsibility which no other country has and it ought to be admitted by people in this place that that responsibility will not change when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is established as an independent country <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If events confirm the suspicions of my friend from Mackellar and if governments in Peking, Moscow and other places begin to exert pressure on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> it is only to Australia that Port Moresby will be able to look for support - moral, financial and physical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore we should have a clear concept of what our relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that we make it clear to the rest of the world that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be able to rely upon Australia to a degree and in a manner that in all probability it will not be able to rely upon any other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 say to honourable members that if events of this nature were to develop in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> it would not be the people in London but it would be the people here in Canberra who would have to make decisions in relation to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> similar to those that were made by the honourable and gallant gentlemen in the House of Commons about Malaysia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that on 23 August last year the then Minister for External Territories introduced the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> (Application of Laws) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It enabled a smooth transfer of powers to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which was self-governing from 1 December 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some powers, other than defence and foreign affairs, have not been transferred to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government as the Application of Laws Act alone is not the appropriate vehicle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill now before the House will enable <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to administer its own fisheries legislation and, I am informed, the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government wishes to do this as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without this amendment, during the period between self-government and independence, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> boats would continue to be subject to Australian jurisdiction while in Australian proclaimed waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is unacceptable to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which wishes its fishing vessels to be treated in the same manner as other foreign boats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sub-clause 2 (1) willprovide the immediate transfer of powers desired by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and sub-clause 2 (2) will provide the permanent amendment to the principal Act when amendments passed in 1973 are brought into operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This figure includes 926 locally-engaged positions at the Australian High Commission, London, transferred as a result of the repeal of the High Commissioner (U.K.) Act, and 397 positions transferred from the Department of External Territories to the Office of the Australian Development Assistance Agency and the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-9">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs in matters relating to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the Honourable W. Morrison, is attending an Economic Commission on Asia and the Far East conference in Colombo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some 18 or 20 months ago the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  described him as the final and finest of our Administrators in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The majority of Australia’s aid will continue to be directed to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for which we have a special responsibility which will not cease when it attains independence on 1 December 1974. lt is anticipated that our aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be at least $500m over the next 3 years and this must absorb much of our attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time of the announcement of the $500m to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> I had some misgivings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I know how essential to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was an assurance of our willingness to continue our obligation to their country, I was concerned that this could be pointed to as an example of neo-colonialism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I have a lot of confidence in  Mr Johnson  and that the Assistance Agency will perform extremely well in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be important for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to nominate its needs and I am sure that there is much mutual understanding of priorities already. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I mentioned 2 countries at the beginning of my speech I had in mind <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to point out that the Australian Government and particularly the Australian Development Assistance Agency we are talking about tonight will commence massive programs in the country nearest to our north other than <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that his long and close knowledge of the circumstances of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be invaluable not only for the direction of aid to that country but also in his ability to understand the needs of other developing countries which will be the recipients of Australian aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister’s announcement only a week or so ago that the Government has undertaken to provide for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, which is about to become independent, a sum of approximately $A500m over the next 3 years indicates one of the ways by which bilateral aid can give to a country - in this instance one so close to Australia - a feeling of economic confidence which I am sure was material in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> being able to set a date for independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The existing structure involving dispersal of aid functions among several departments needs to be substantially reviewed in the light of the increased complexities and sophistication of development assistance and to accommodate the administration of aid to an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need look no further than the earnings of Bougainville Copper Pty Ltd in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second feature of Australia’s aid is the heavy concentration on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, which absorbs about two-thirds of Australia’s official development assistance and an even greater percentage of the total flow of financial resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two-thirds of Australia’s development assistance, as I said earlier, goes to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, of course, has announced that $500m will go to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> over the next 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may interpose a personal view here, I am hopeful that other countries also will help in the development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, to take some of the burden of that country off our shoulders so that we can spread the aid that is available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is in favour of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Good heavens, fancy the recipient of such vast sums as Australia proposes to make available to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, saying anything critical of the structure through which Australia decides to disburse aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> said that he hopes to get on well with the agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that specifically, in relation to the speeches I have heard this afternoon, it seemed to me that the honourable member for Curtin  (Mr Garland)  was somewhat patronising not only towards the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  but also toward the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He pointed out that the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> approved of the establishment of an agency and then he said: That is what one could expect because the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is getting a great deal of aid - $500m.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Up to December 1973, the Department of External Territories administered aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This deficiency was apparent and in March of last year the Prime Minister commissioned a task force to examine all the options for a unified administration to administer all aid, including multilateral aid, all bilateral aid and aid to an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The existing structure involving dispersal of aid functions among several departments needs to be substantially reviewed in the light of the increased complexities and sophistication of development assistance and to accommodate the administration of aid to an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that in my speech I had been patronising to the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>,  Mr Somare,  had said that he looks forward to a fruitful and friendly relationship with the Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak with some knowledge in this area - I do not want to develop the point - of the difficulties encountered by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the shortages that that country has suffered in not having sufficient numbers of trained draftsmen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was pointed out by the Minister in his second reading speech that, without amendment, during the period between selfgovernment and independence, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> boats would continue to be subject to Australian jurisdiction while in Australian proclaimed waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that on 23 August last year the then Minister for External Territories introduced the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> (Application of Laws) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It enabled a smooth transfer of powers to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which was selfgoverning from 1 December 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some powers, other than defence and foreign affairs have not been transferred to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government as the Application of Laws Act alone is not the appropriate vehicle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill now before the House will enable <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to administer its own fisheries legislation and, I am informed, the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government wishes to do this as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill now before the House will enable <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to administer its own fisheries legislation . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without this amendment, during the period between selfgovernment and independence, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> boats would continue to be subject to Australian jurisdiction while in Australian proclaimed waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> boats will not be under Australian Government jurisdiction, not only in Australian waters but also in any other part of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These include the question of the definition of foreign boats and the fact that the Bill would enable the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government to administer its own fisheries legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Powers were being accepted by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and there was a smooth and orderly movement towards self-government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A provision in the Bill will amend the existing legislation because the present position is unacceptable to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which wishes its fishing vessels to be treated in the same manner as other foreign boats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is involved is the contentious question of the border between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidently proposals have been put by the Premier of Queensland to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has suggested how the Governments of Australia, Queensland and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the people of the Torres Strait Islands can resolve this continuing problem between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undoubtedly this Bill does not deal with the question of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> border or with negotiations in respect of that matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought I made it clear, and I thought it was agreed by the honourable member for Kooyong, that the Bill basically covers 2 important issues, namely, the question of enabling <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to administer its own fisheries legislation and, secondly, to overcome the problem of the definition of foreign boats as it appears in existing fisheries legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have pointed out, I do not want to unduly restrict debate but I think it is not proper to enter into a debate on the pros and cons of where the border of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without this amendment during the period between selfgovernment and Independence, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> boats would continue to be subject to Australian jurisdiction while in Australian proclaimed waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question that arises is whether there is a difference of opinion between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and ourselves over the extent to which we should restrain our proclamation over those waters and the extent to which we should move the boundary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government has not responded to it but the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has himself said that he must deal with the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without this amendment, during the period between self-government and independence, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> boats would continue to be subject to Australian jurisdiction while in Australian proclaimed waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also remind the honourable member for Kooyong that the question of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> border does not come within the provisions of this legislation, as I stated previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without a doubt the Bill now before the House, as stated by the Minister in the second reading speech, will enable <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to establish its own fisheries powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Visiting United Nations commissions, the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly, the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs of this Australian Parliament in 1966 and this new Australian Government have indicated that there ought to be changes but the last named has done nothing about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was legitimate to raise it because what is involved in this legislation is not just the transfer of fisheries control but the transfer of legislative and administrative functions to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and it relates to the jurisdiction over proclaimed waters - what we have referred to here as Australian proclaimed waters between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fisheries (<span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Boats) Bill is very simple. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill goes along with the wishes of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, which wishes its fishing boats to be treated as foreign boats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> wants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> boats have been fishing in the area for many years; we have never restricted them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition supports this Bill, but it is concerned that in a discussion about fishing there should be a recognition of the implications of the transfer of powers, which the Fisheries (<span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Boats) Bill is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is intended to make sure that the foreign boat category includes boats of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the same way as Australian legislation now excludes all other boats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is that the Bill is part of the transfer of powers to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> towards its exercising of the complete functions of a self governing independent country as from 1 December 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In passing the powers from the Australian Parliament to that of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> the legislation does not canvass the implications of fishing and the intertwining of fishing rights in areas that are adjacent to both countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the necessity for the legislation to recognise licences granted under Australian legislation for boats registered in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> comes out of the specific exclusion that is within clause 4 of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agreement arrived at in initial discussions that took place between Chief Minister Michael Somare, my friend the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock),  who spoke a few moments ago, and I for the purpose of trying to establish a basis by which <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> boats could operate in Australian proclaimed waters has largely been adopted in subsequent discussions between the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and Chief Minister Somare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a difficult area because the boats that are operating from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> waters fall into the 2 classes to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no dispute about the rights of the indigenous Papuan New Guinea fishermen operating in waters in the Torres Strait and elsewhere where the 2 countries traditionally or Papua New Guineans in particular and people from the Torres Strait Islands have exercised their fishing interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difficulties that have emerged have come out of the very natural desire that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has had to see its fishing responsibilities extended into a viable commercial arena. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some Middle East capital has been invested in fishing operations in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were conscious in the discussions with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that it was necessary that we try to meet the twin objectives of encouraging <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s commercial development of a fishing industry on a larger scale, but equally of not prejudicing the operation of Australian fishing boats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A reasonable compromise has been reached and I hope that in the operation of future agreements that will be necessary for fishing in Australian proclaimed waters it will continue to be possible for a reconciliation of the difficulties that we see in meeting these twin objectives, namely, that of encouraging <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s commercial development and a commercial fishing industry without prejudicing the operation of Australian fishing boats, particularly in the Gulf of Carpenteria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I did want to advert to fishing in this area because I believe that we have an interest in Australia in helping <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> towards the establishment of a commercial industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a particular problem because of the dispute which still exists between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia over the future territorial boundaries between the 2 countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important that we recognise that a great deal needs to be done for a country like <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, as for Australia, to ensure that there is adequate knowledge of what the fish, sea and ocean resources might be before the full advantages of this other form of natural resource can be exploited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that in the transfer of power there will continue to be co-operation in the field of developing an understanding of what ocean resources exist, to what extent they might be available for exploitation and how they can be best turned to the commercial advantage of both <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that apart from the general aid that we provide for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, meaningful financial assistance can be provided specifically in this field, in order to ensure that both countries understand their ocean resources and that both countries can utilise them in terms of the exercise of their own sovereign responsibilities - that which is about to be exercised as a result of the passage of this Bill and that which is still exercised and will continue to be exercised by Australian governments in the exercise of their residual fishing responsibility within our own constitutional responsibility and within our own territorial waters and proclaimed waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would have a common interest in ensuring the maximum possible jurisdiction over fishing within this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the resolution of the extent of territorial waters, I believe that it is important for countries like <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia not only to gain the maximum jurisdiction over these waters but also to ensure that they take advantage of the fishing rights within those waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, it is also important that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia maintain a research program and a co-operative effort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we have to be very conscious of the effect that any licenses which are granted for the commercial exploitation of fishing waters, particularly those Australian proclaimed waters to the north in which a commercial industry operating in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> might wish to fish, might have on the interests of indigenous Australian fishermen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill simply transfers to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> a responsibility which in the past we have exercised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the exercise of the responsibility which henceforth will be that of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> there is I think a necessity for both of our countries to maintain the closest possible liaison to ensure that the fishing and ocean resources can be exploited to the mutual advantage of both of our countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member stated that the Government had done nothing since coming to office to resolve the border dispute between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On IS December 1972 when I was half the Government I wrote to the Premier of Queensland suggesting that officials of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, Queensland and the Australian Government hold discussions on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since then ministerial and official discussions have been held between the Australian and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been consultations with the Torres Strait Islanders, and discussions have been arranged between the Torres Strait Islanders and the coastal people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issues have not yet been discussed between the Australian and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this week the Premier of Queensland proposed to telephone the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> about the matter, the Chief Minister got in touch with me and I encouraged a discussion between him and the Premier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He realises that it is not possible for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to reach a separate agreement with Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> becomes independent, presumably before the end of this year, negotiations will take place - as international law negotiations can only take place - between the Australian and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> governments only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in view of the Premier’s changed attitude about discussions with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government, I have again invited him to take part in official discussions with the Australian and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> governments with a view to reaching an agreed settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill transferring jurisdiction for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> fishing boats is relatively short but its implications are considerable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like Australia, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is an island, and many of the comments which apply to Australia apply also to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as in this country the fishing industry is one of the most rapidly developing primary industries, so I am sure the development and exploitation of the fisheries resources will be important to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Historically the industry in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been a fairly simple one - simple in the sense of the equipment which has been used until now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As in Australia there is a growing emphasis on larger vessels and more sophisticated equipment, this change in emphasis will apply to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, although perhaps not to quite the same degree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course historically these resources have been a considerable source of protein in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and that will continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if experience along the northern Australian coast is any guide - I am sure that it is - there must be considerable opportunities for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to develop and expand an export industry in fisheries products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I was saying, there will be every opportunity for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> through development of its fisheries resources not only to make a valuable contribution to its own food supplies but also, if experience in northern Australian waters is a guide - I said I thought it would be a guide - to develop export possibilities for the fishing industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly in the earlier days of independence <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will have difficulty finding the research funds which will be necessary to determine all that needs to be known about its fishing grounds, the types of fish available, their habits and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also true that a great deal of the research in Australian fishery resources is being carried out in waters adjacent to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> “waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With all that research going on up there, basically for our own purposes, I hope that as results that could be valuable to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> become available the Austraiian Government will see to it that that country is kept informed of the latest results of our research in those waters so that in turn <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> can benefit from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt eventually <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will initiate projects of its own, but in the early days I believe that Australia can make a valuable contribution without any additional expenditure of money - merely by seeing that what benefits we have gained from our research are, if applicable, communicated to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the problems that I imagine <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will face is that of meeting the export standards of many countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here again I imagine that our own Department of Primary Industry and perhaps the Department of Health could be of considerable assistance in advising <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on standards required in processing plants and the testing of samples to make sure that they comply with international world health standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inevitably that will be an area of difficulty for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in its early years of self government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill before the House is of very great significance because it facilitates the full administrative arrangements necessary in the self-government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in respect of the fishing industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that this House would want to assist the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to the greatest possible extent in the smoothest possible transference of powers of this kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fishing industry has particular significance to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, there is the circumstance that fishing is really part and parcel of the sustenance of very many people around the coastline of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and in particular it is of great importance to their welfare and their future stability in terms not only of sustenance but also of the gradual development of commercial fishing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that area lying between the territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia there has been a degree of concern as to the future of the actual line of demarcation; in other words, the border between the 2 territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is a matter of extreme importance from the point of view of our relationships with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to co-operate in every way to ensure that the administration of the fishing industry avoids any of the sensitive areas of administration which so often cause friction between countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must take another aspect into consideration, namely, the carry through of what I was saying about the importance of fishing to the individual Papua New Guineans along the coastline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the advent of scientific techniques in fishing around the world and with the gradual development of standards in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, undoubtedly a situation will arise in which more sophisticated equipment will be used than hitherto has been the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the legislation which has been enacted in the Parliament of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I presume too that we have assisted to make possible the best law for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and in so doing have ensured that the interpretation of that law will apply in the interests of both countries, because it would be folly indeed for us to have a situation in which there was any variation in interpretation of the fishing laws of Australia and the fishing laws of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can well imagine similar situations arising in the waters of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, bearing in mind that undoubtedly commercial fishing ventures will be developed in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These commercial ventures could be undertaken for the very good reason that the fishing grounds of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> have already been assessed and shown to have good resources in the various categories of fish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commercial enterprises, undoubtedly, will become a factor in the growing economy of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, I would assume that Australia, as the country that has the greatest responsibility to assist <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, would want to help with the development of an effective viable commercial fishing industry in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there can be an effective relationship between our 2 countries provided that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> does not grant rights that are too easily won, or should I say that do not involve reasonable conditions and restraints on those who might want to go into ventures that the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> may propose or that others may propose to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not want to see undue intrusion into those waters by interests based on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust that the Government has considered this aspect carefully in the drafting of this legislation and in its negotiations with the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that we will be co-operating closely with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to ensure that it too observes this most necessary precaution - a precaution that could well mean that in the long term we preserve an effective supply of fish, fish oil and other fish products to sustain the protein requirements of big consumers of fish and at the same time to participate in the world market for the supply of fish from the seas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, we must ensure that the best scientific advice is followed and, secondly, that we co-operate with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the construction and the standards for construction of boats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scope of ship building in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can recall seeing a small slipway at Madang where efforts were being made to construct fishing boats of the kind that could be operated in the waters of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know what has happened to that venture over the last couple of years but it is the kind of venture that we should do all we can to support and encourage, not in terms of creating competition for our own fishermen but in terms of creating a capacity in fishing that will ensure that the waters of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are not unduly exploited but that an effective approach, to the care of fishing grounds is considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally Australia, of course, is assisting <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> financially to a very great extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the long run this will produce for the area north of Australia and the regions around <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, which are important to Australia, a fishing industry in the best interests of both countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Various points of view were put forward regarding some vital issues in relation to future determinations about territorial boundaries and fishing in so-called international waters lying between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Cowper  (Mr Ian Robinson)  also sounded a note of caution with respect to not only Papua New Guinean boats but boats from other countries coming into the grey areas of Australian proclaimed waters such as those off the coast of New South Wales, Tasmania, the Great Barrier Reef and the Gulf of Carpentaria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Bill is passed it will of course give <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> complete control of the administration of its own fishing laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the present laws any boats from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in Australian proclaimed waters come under the jurisdiction of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This amendment to the Fisheries Act will alter that and will mean that boats from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be treated in exactly the same way as all other foreign boats coming into Australian waters, fishing zones, territorial sea waters or whatever it might be, keeping in mind of course any bilateral agreements which might exist between the 2 countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Cowper raised a point regarding the type of legislation that was passed by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This hope was that it would allow for co-operation between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> or, for that matter, any other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That certainly can be achieved and will be achieved by the Act that has been passed by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government in relation to the Australian laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I pointed out before, in practice there was a de facto relationship in that the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> really had autonomy regarding the operation of its boats in adjacent waters, but, as has been pointed out, that is not correct in terms of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill, if passed, will in fact legalise the unrestricted entry of boats from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> into the international waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria, that is, outside the 12-mile limit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Australian Government’s hope that a bilateral fishing agreement will be ironed out between the Australian Govern- ment and the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government which will allow for the rational management and husbandry of the fishing resources in the areas’ which lie in common ground between the- 2 countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will also mean, of course, that boats from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, which will be able to fish anywhere in the world, will as far as Australia is concerned, be able to fish anywhere off the coast of Australia - not just in the Gulf of Carpentaria or the Torres Strait or in waters adjacent to northern Australia but adjacent to any part of Australia - as long as they are in international waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that with sensible government by the 2 countries concerned we will in fact be able to evolve fully co-operative fishing laws and other laws that will enable the development of sound conservation principles in relation to the exploitation of the waters which lie adjacent to and between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and northern Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think all members of the Parliament will welcome this Bill, which will allow <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to be the complete master of its own fishing vessels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the talks last week with  Mr Kiki  provided valuable guidance for the defence relationship between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> becomes independent, and what contributions will be welcome and useful from us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> achieved self-government in December 1973, the relationship between the governments of Australia and of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been based on the principles of equality, mutual respect and mutual co-operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Bill 1974 and the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Bill 1974 is to give effect to a request by the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly be given authority to legislate with respect to mining for petroleum and other minerals in the territorial sea and the continental shelf within the adjacent areas of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as defined in the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967-1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the advent of self government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on 1 December 1973 authority over all functions of government passed to the control of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> with the exception of a small number of functions which were reserved to Australia- the most important of these being defence and foreign relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Authority over the function of off-shore mining passed to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> had the right, consistently with self government,  to  legislate in regard to offshore rnining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an interim measure, until the necessary legislation could be enacted, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is designated authority in respect of the adjacent areas of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act, delegated his authority to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Minister for Mines and Energy and certain <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government agreed to permit <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to enact its own legislation subject to 2 conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Chief Minister has agreed to these 2 conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>He has also indicated that the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government shares Australia’s concern to protect the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking these Bills in turn, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Bill provides for the repeal from a date to be proclaimed of the provisions of the principal Act that extend to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This date will be the date of commencement of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s own off-shore legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 4 amends section 7 of the principal Act by ceasing its extension to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and clause 5 omits reference to the Australian Minister as the designated authority in respect of the adjacent areas of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 6 repeals the section of the principal Act which deals with the payment of fees, royalties, etc., to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and provides that any moneys received by Australia before the date of commencement of this Act are to be paid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 8 removes the description of the adjacent areas of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from the second schedule to the principal Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Bill puts beyond doubt the authority of the House of Assembly to legislate with regard to off-shoremining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw to the attention of honourable members the fact that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s authority to legislate with regard to off-shore mining is confined to the territorial sea and the continental shelf within the adjacent areas of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has agreed to conform to Australia’s international obligations in regard to the law of the sea conventions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the function of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> ‘s foreign relations is reserved to Australia, the policy of the Australian Government has been to involve fully <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and to exercise that function only after the fullest consultation with and advice from the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistent with this policy Australia has encouraged <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to take its place in the international community and one example of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s increasing involvement in this community was its participation in the recent Law of the Sea Conference in Caracas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bills I am introducing are a further step in the devolution of authority to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> so that when independence comes there will not be one aspect of government with which <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will not be familiar and experienced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New budgetary arrangements for providing financial assistance to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in respect of defence are being introduced with effect from 1 December 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An amount of $12.5 million is being provided for defence cooperation with, and defence financial assistance to, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from that date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Estimated expenditure on defence in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> this year, prior to 1 December, is $ 10.2 million. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They form part of the movement towards independence for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, they give legislative authority to what has been existing by way of delegation from the Minister for Foreign Affairs as the authority under the appropriate legislation, who delegated his authority to the Minister for Mines in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to handle off-shore mining within the area described by the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Bill as an adjacent area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Bill which provides for the repeal of the provisions of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act that extend to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, this amending legislation exercises reference to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having done that, the second piece of legislation- the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Billamends the principal Act by transferring to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly the power with regard to off-shore mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is necessary to ensure that there is no doubt that the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly has absolute power over legislation in respect of offshore mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not altogether impressed with the legislation that has been presented to the House, but I want to pose a question to the Minister Assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Matters Relating to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>  (Mr Morrison). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In repealing that part of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act which refers to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the amending legislation refers, of course, to the areas designated under the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this instance, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Queensland share a boundary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak not of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>-Queensland boundary but of the areas designated in the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not merely the .sensitive issue of the movement of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> towards independence but the sensitive issue of the border between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have a contentious boundary between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Queensland- a matter on which the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has expressed itself in very forcible terms, particularly individual Ministers in that Government, indicating that the boundary between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Queensland ought to be moved south. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have a situation here giving power to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly over an area that is not consistent with the boundary between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be borne in mind what was agreed to in  1 967-  as was said by the then Minister for National Developmentthat there is now a variation in the capacity at law of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government to grant permits for off-shore mining, and that the area designated for it to do so is different from the boundaries between the  2  countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that because the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  when he first came to office, sought unilaterally to move the border between Papua and Queensland or, as he put it, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Self government, of course, was reached in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on 1 December last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that we would have heard more of the negotiations between the Government of Australia and the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in regard to these 2 specific areas of foreign affairs and defence before any likely date of independence was announced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government, of course, has been accused by the Constitutional Planning Committee of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> of forcing the pace of independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting that the Constitutional Planning Committee should accuse the Government of that, because it is described in the terminology of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as a radical body, but it has felt that this Government has forced the pace somewhat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that overall the Government has responded to the wishes of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, but it seems to me that it would have been wise to settle all areas prior to independence so that on independence the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government would not just in fact be governing in all areas but would be doing so at law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned at what will happen when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> achieves independence, whether it be April or May of next year or whatever date the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to feel that matters which are outside the province of the Minister for Science, who is the Minister in charge of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> affairs and the former Minister for External Territories, and which are primarily matters within the jurisdiction of the Minister for Defence  (Mr Barnard)  will be put to us clearly and unequivocally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just wanted to flag the fact that I am concerned that for almost 20 months now I have been standing here asking for information about the defence arrangements between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia, and I ask for it again in the course of this debate because the Minister himself has said in his own speech that this legislation is part of the movement towards independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally, too, am I concerned that we may reach the date of independence some time next year, with our blessing, at the request of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, without resolving the dispute over the border between Papua and Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I understand it, officials of the Commonwealth Government, the Queensland Government- I do not know about representatives of the Torres Strait Islanders, although they are Australian citizens and ought to be involved- and officials of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government have been meeting to talk about the border. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have warned previously in this Parliament that it is one of those issues that I feel, after independence, will be raised within the United Nations if the Commonwealth Government has not acted fairly in consultation with the Government of Queensland and the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not asked the Minister for Science to give me any answers, but I have asked the Minister responsible for defence matters to advise us at some stage very shortly about defence arrangements between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This self-proclaimed party in government which is so interested in keeping white faces out of Asia and the Pacific is prepared to allow a minimum of 600 Australian servicemen to be seconded to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> defence force and not even state a role for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can only act on the basis of the advice of the leadership group elected by the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in this instance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Government will not continue to force the pace and that it will respond primarily to the wishes of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that this is so, but the transition to independence is at a delicate stage and it is a stage where we should be ensuring that the utmost assistance is forthcoming when it is requested from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the Minister, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has agreed in the exchange of correspondence or by some other means to abide by the agreements on the environment and on restricting itself to the adjacent areas of Queensland and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which is confined to the territorial sea and the continental shelf within the areas designated as adjacent areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to be able to feel that in so responding to requests for assistance from the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> we could do more than we actually did in the budgetary provisions last night to meet our obligations to that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears to me that a fact that has been neglected is that although the largest single increase in this year’s aid allocation to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is for employment termination and retirement benefits for Australians leaving <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the amount involved is more than double the total increase in aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, a good deal of the so-called aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will find its way to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My cursory examination of the documents revealed to me that $43m of an amount which was provided last year for a wide variety of functions that were transferred to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government- a transfer of functions is involved in this legislation; that is why I have referred to this matter,  Mr Speakerwas  not required under the items for the transfer of functions and that it has not been re-allocated or that very little of it has been re-allocated to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> itself but has gone elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But our special responsibility at this time is to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me to be most unfortunate that money is being used elsewhere at a time when it is required in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should imagine that it has been requested that additional funds be granted to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The actual amount- the real amount- given to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by the Australian Government has been exacerbated by inflation anyway, and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> itself has grave inflationary problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar)  has reminded me that there will probably be a reduction in aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, especially when the effect of inflation are taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that the Australian Labor Party is in many ways paying only lip service to the expansion of aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the termination and retirement benefits of Australians are excluded the amount of aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has undoubtedly declined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have qualified that to some extent by saying that bodies in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> have criticised the present Government for forcing the pace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was saying that we had hoped that the process of independence would be gradual- not gradual in the sense that it necessarily would be slow but that it would be smooth and not a sudden break from one status and set of reponsibilities to another, which are words that will be familiar to some in this House- so that when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s independence came it would signify the last step in a long process that had been taken and that a whole series of changes would not be occurring overnight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am somewhat troubled by the way in which special committees in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, particularly the Constitutional Planning Committee, have criticised that movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the function of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s foreign relations is reserved to Australia, the policy of the Australian Government has been to involve fully <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and to exercise that function only after the fullest consultation with and advice from the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistent with this policy Australia has encouraged <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to take its place in the international community and one example of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s increasing involvement in this community was its participation in the recent Law of the Sea Conference in Caracas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason I said that it was sloppy was because my understanding of the boundary mentioned in the Schedule to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act is that the boundary is in fact inaccurate, that it was drawn in 1967 and that maps subsequent to that date which I recall having seen reveal that part of the description in the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act in fact covers the land mass of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-It is grossly unfair of the Minister to say that because he is well aware that boundaries and areas in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> had to be changed and amended geographically following the use of up-to-date mapping techniques and that areas that were subsequently opened up were drawn more accurately later on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have to be rectified or <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> clearly will take the Papua-Queensland border dispute to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we wish that this Government would be more precise in the nature of the legislation it introduces and ensure that where there are anomalies in the geographic areas it would seek to clear them up rather than bury them amongst the morass of material that is discussed between the governments of Queensland, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not want to see major constitutional issue develop concerning our relationship with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No doubt he will be aware of a statement made by  Mr Albert  Maori-Kiki, the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Minister for Defence, Foreign Relations and Trade in April. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He may also be aware- if he is not I advise him now- that the Minister made a statement a couple of days ago announcing that a <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Department of Defence would be established on 1 October and that as from 1 December 1974 that Department would administer funds provided through the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill seeks the approval of Parliament to the guarantee by the Australian Government of a US$10.8m-A$7.3m- borrowing by the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proceeds of the loan will assist in financing the development and expansion of the operations of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Electricity Commission during the period 1974-79. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This loan follows a loan for US$23.2m-A$15.6m-to the Electricity Commission in 1971 to assist in financing a major hydro-electric project on the Upper Ramu River in the Highlands of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The loan documents were signed by authorised representatives of the Australian Government on 12 June following negotiations in Washington which were attended by representatives of the International Bank, Australia, the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the Electricity Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will onlend the proceeds of the loan to the Electricity Commission which, under an associated project agreement between the Commission and the Bank, is responsible for the project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Borrowings by the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> automatically carry an Australian Government guarantee by virtue of the operation of section 75a of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act 1949-1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The guarantee agreement for this loan, which is shown as the First Schedule to the Bill, follows the form of the 4 guarantee agreements previously approved by Parliament in connection with a telecommunications loan made by the International Bank to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in 1968, a highways loan made in 1970, the first hydroelectric project loan in 1971 and a second telecommunications project loan in 1 972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill seeks the approval of Parliament to the provision of contractual guarantees by the Australian Government for overseas borrowings by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government in foreign currencies not exceeding the equivalent of $20m prior to achievement of independence in 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the 1 972-73 financial year the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government made its first overseas borrowing on the international capital market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Loans Guarantee Act 1973 guarantees for loans of 5 billion yen and 50 million Swiss francs have also been given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parliament has also, on a number of previous occasions, approved similar contractual guarantees by the Australian Government in respect of loans to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Asian Development Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed that arrangements for the borrowings for which this Bill provides contractual guarantees will be concluded prior to the achievement of independence by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Loan possibilities on overseas markets are currently being investigated by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The form of guarantee that is customarily required in international capital markets is similar to those that have been given to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and to the Asian Development Bank in respect of borrowings by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from those institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill is purposely couched in general terms in respect of the currencies and the precise forms of the proposed borrowings so as not to restrict the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government’s choice as to the particular overseas markets in which it finally decides to arrange the loans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision of contractual guarantees by the Australian Government will materially assist <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in negotiating favourable terms for the borrowings as well as enhancing its status as a borrower on overseas capital markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many of these people have spent many years in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and have established their means of livelihood there, and it would seem unjust to deprive them of benefits because of changed circumstances beyond their control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government proposes to allow persons resident in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> prior to that country  gaining  its Independence, and who continue to reside there after Independence, to be then considered still resident in Australia or its Territories for repatriation purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Loans Guarantee Bill 1974 seeks parliamentary approval for the provision of contractual guarantees by the Australian Government for overseas, foreign currency borrowings of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government, made prior to the date of independence in 1974-1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the purposes of the Bill, the loan funds so guaranteed will be used specifically for the financing of public works and services as yet to be determined by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition Parties fully support the Government in the passage of this enabling legislation, which we view to be of particularly high priority, given the imminence of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is appropriate that the Australian Government should assist <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the task of capital mobilisation, which of course, has been made even more difficult by the highly illiquid state of world capital markets at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be hoped that by underwriting <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s current loan requirements, Australia can assist that country to achieve the most attractive terms available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will provide the latitude necessary for the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government to negotiate the loans required, in a manner that is consistent with that Government’s own assessment of its capital requirements and development policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government has demonstrated a very high level of competence and responsibility in its domestic financial management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal and Country Parties believe that it is consistent with this high level of performance that the terms of the Bill should be discretionary and therefore not act as a constraint on the execution of the internal development policies of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difficulties of capital mobilisation within this country Will of course, influence the capacity of enterprises in the private sector of the Papua New Guinean economy to raise their capital requirements from Australia on favourable terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Despite this, the Opposition Parties fully support the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Loans Guarantee BUI 1974 and will assist its rapid passage through this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Loan (International Bank) BUI 1974 seeks parliamentary approval for the Australian Government to guarantee a US$1 0.8m borrowing by the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although borrowings by the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are automatically guaranteed by Australia under the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act 1949-73, the International Bank requires a formal guarantee agreement for loan arrangements of this nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proceeds of the loan will assist in financing the operations of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Electricity Commission between 1974 and 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The central importance of transport systems in the development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was clearly established in the recommendations of the 1963 Mission from the International Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that the development finance guaranteed in 1970 has proved to be a valuable form of assistance to the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commission’s objective of supplying cheap power to all parts of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and of utilising the excess capacity of low cost generating plant installed for heavy industry is an important component of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> advancement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government would have had difficulty in meeting the request for additional police because of the shortage of men in State police forces and the secondment of some Australian police to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-52-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The recent report of Professor Specht and his associates, entitled ‘Conservation of  Major Plant  Communities in Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’, drew attention to the fact that only about half of the distinct plant communities in this country are protected in national parks and reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-This Bill which is known as the Repatriation Acts Amendment Bill 1974 is a combined Bill which will authorise changes to the Repatriation Act, the Interim Forces Benefits Act, the Repatriation (Far East Strategic Reserve) Act, the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act, the Native Members of the Forces Benefits Act- which will be retitled the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> (Members of the Forces Benefits) Act in order to get rid of the word ‘Native’, a purpose with which the Opposition concurs- and also the Seamen’s War Pensions and Allowances Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fundamental purpose of the Bill is to increase the rates of certain pensions and allowances, to authorise persons resident in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> immediately before that country becomes an independent sovereign State and who continue to reside there to be deemed to be residents of Australia for the purpose of obtaining those benefits which may be provided only to residents of Australia and its Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Government is cognisant of the changing factors in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, such persons residing in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> immediately before independence will be deemed to be resident in Australia for repatriation purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Bill proposes to broaden the eligibility criteria of the overseas investment insurance scheme and to bring <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> within the scope of the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, as the scheme now stands, investments in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are specifically excluded from the scope of the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, in recognition of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s expressed desire for increased Australian investment to further its social and economic development plans, it is proposed to extend the scope of the overseas investment insurance scheme to cover new eligible investments in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, they are based on the principles of the United Nations and Australia’s support for the right of self determination for all colonial people- and this is an attitude that has guided us in our policy towards <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is thus small in size and in population when compared with Australia’s other neighbours in the area- Indonesia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the second is multilateral aid and the third is bilateral aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures before us show a decrease in the proposed aid payments to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in 1974-75 because of the extra large financial assistance given to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in 1973-74 to facilitate its transition to selfgovernment on 1 December 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us suppose that it were decided to commit a complete task force of 3 battalions in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to assist in a confrontation situation in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 3 reasons for this: Firstly, we could not put a force into <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, or for that matter anywhere else, without holding in Australia a substantial reserve to meet unexpected contingencies within the operational area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would have the closest liaison in defence preparedness with Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the exchange of personnel for defence training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what really concerns me and creates an area of potential threat to Australia is the announcement by this Government that all of our defence forces will be withdrawn from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sad fact is that obviously there has been a deterioration at least of this aspect of our relationship with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The document sets out a continuation of that close consultation and co-operation with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the major developments that have taken place recently in that country, which is setting up a defence administration in its own right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also sets out Australia’s continued role in co-operation with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> defence forces in the years ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I deny that there would be any reluctance on the part of a Labor Party government in this country to accept responsibility for the defence forces in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> because, frankly, given the fact that Australia has continuing responsibilities for assisting <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, we would not- I put it to honourable members opposite that they would not eitherwant to see a newly emergent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> devoting an over-large amount of its money to defence preparedness when there are so many more urgent things for it to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our naval patrol boat force is expected to fall to the small number of 13 within the next month or so with the handing over to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> of 5 Attack class boats from the Navy’s fleet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the inadequacy of past arrangements, also recognised by the Joint Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee’s 1972 inquiry into Australia’s foreign aid, in March of last year the Prime Minister commissioned a task force ‘to examine all the options for a unified aid administration to administer all aid including multilateral aid, all bilateral aid and aid to an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 ) Chapter 2 1 of the Australian Labor Party Platform Constitution and Rules as approved by the 29th Conference at Launceston 1971 stated: ‘Labor will establish a Pacific Islands Division within the Department of Foreign Affairs to second and support skilled personnel requested by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and other Islands of the Pacific for their civil and armed forces. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-36-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In organisational terms a full Division in the Department of Foreign Affairs to handle Australia’s relations with the Pacific Islands and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is not justified at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-36-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not one word has been given to the Parliament about the date for independence, about what is transpiring in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, about the continued transfer of administrative and legislative functions from Australia to that country, or about the post-independence relations between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That special relationship between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, which we hope will continue in the post-independence scene, is not being guaranteed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was discussing the lack of information that had flowed from the Australian Government in relation to post-independence relations between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia and other factors leading up to the independence of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While I have been talking about a small area, the area which I want to pass on to before moving to the basis of the strategic assessment contained in the Defence Report is a territory of Australia which is smaller in area than <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>- the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill also proposes some technical amendments concerned with the allowance in tax assessments of our residents of a credit for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> tax on income derived there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendments, which I foreshadowed in an announcement I made last year, are consequential upon the introduction of a dividend withholding tax by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in August 1972 and will ensure that appropriate credit is allowed for that tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The sorry facts of the aid record of the Government are that it has discouraged rural production in a hungry world and it can muster only 0.6 per cent of the gross national product for aid, and that includes the specific obligation we have to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act 1949-1974 to enable Australia to transfer to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> responsibility for those matters which at present remain reserved to Australia, as soon as their transfer is requested by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is also in line with a recent statement by the Opposition spokesman on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> matters, the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock)  who argued that it would be wise ‘To settle all areas prior to independence so that on independence the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government would not just be governing in all areas but would be doing so at law.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Judges’ Pensions Act 1968-1973 to provide for the payment of pensions to persons who are or have been judges of the Supreme Court of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> (<span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> judges). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The effect of the Bill will be to bring those of the present judges who were appointed before 1 December 1973, the date on which <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> achieved self-Government, under the Australian Judges’ Pensions Act, so that their pension rights are guaranteed by Australian legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 4 provides that a <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> judge appointed before 1 December 1973 who has attained the age of 55 years and who retires after serving as a judge for not less than 10 years will be entitled to a full pension at a rate equal to 60 per centum of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 19 July 1972, the former Treasurer and present Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Snedden,  foreshadowed legislative measures to curtail tax avoidance with respect to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, Norfolk, Cocos Islands and Christmas Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Briefly, this legislation provides for increased tax liabilities for the mining industry, the imposition of taxation on certain forms of fringe benefits, the specific allowance of deductions for depreciation on child care facilities, a reduction of the limit on deductions for educational expenses, the deductibility of mortgage interest payments, a reduced level of the special deduction allowable to life assurance companies, a rebate of dependants’ allowances for low income families; and technical amendments fo the principal Act with respect to dividends payable from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the relief of taxpayers in cases of hardship and provisional tax for 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition it is worth pointing out that there is a separate <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> office attached to the Department of Foreign Affairs with its own economic branch and in the Department of Foreign Affairs there is also a <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> section which is supposed to examine Australia’s political associations with that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the utmost respect to the judges of the Supreme Court of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, it seems to me that it is most necessary to give them the security provided by this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The transfer of the functions of the Supreme Court to the control of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is a most important matter from the domestic point of view, and the Opposition supports it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is the case, I should have thought that, if not the Minister for Science, at least the man who ran away from the responsibility of answering for both the administration of defence services in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and more importantly the arrangements between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in a postindependence scene ought to have been prepared to tell us in this Parliament what the arrangements will be either after this Bill is passed and in due course is proclaimed or after independence what the relations between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be in the defence sphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst I was the Minister for External Territories the Government of which I was a member agreed that we would discuss well before independence what the relations after independence would be, on the very axiomatic point that this takes some time to develop, that it would not be in Australia’s national interest or indeed in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s interest to wait until the date is reached and then look at one another, as it were, and determine how we are going to go about things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I say, we wanted this not only in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s interest, but also in Australia’s interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what study of Australia’s national interests in relation to our arrangements with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been done? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust that the Minister when he comes round to replying in this debate will inject some certainty for those who are concerned about post-independence relations between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and will advise us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important because after this piece of legislation apart from, as I understand it, certain Australian defence legislation that applies equally to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and will have to be eradicated so that it applies only to Australia, there will be an independence Bill and the final obliteration of the remnants of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act which is being amended by this Bill, and little else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know its reluctance generally but why the reluctance in regard to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, that country which has a special relationship with us over and above any other relationship that we have had with any other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that if we examine the relationship between metropolitan powers and administered entities- whether it be with African countries, whether it be Fiji and the United Kingdom or what other entity one chooses- we would see that there has probably not been an administered area which was as close to the metropolitan power, not geographically but in the way it moved towards its independence- as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> used to be to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Constitutional Planning Committee in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> last year said that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And, of course, the words of the Minister a couple of weeks ago in a statement in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> conflicted with a statement he made in this House, or appeared to do so by Press reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This unique situation which is unsatisfactory both to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia will not and cannot continue any longer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a period in which we have desisted from making any statement that could seem to be, or could be seen to be, an interference in the affairs of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the honourable member with his keen awareness of the developments in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would recognise that in fact, in reality, there was no distinction between what he said and what he was reported to have said but a very real distinction between either one of the variants that have been put to us and what was said here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has been a good Minister in regard to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and I do not want to spend time denigrating the efforts he has made in developing a close relationship with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be pointed out for the record on this important occasion on which almost the penultimate Bill on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been brought into this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is to become independent in a matter of months, surely its territorial jurisdiction ought to be certain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I say, it may only be a matter of months, less than 12 months, until <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> becomes independent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does the Government not clarify the border situation and indicate that the border can be moved only with the co-operation of and in consultation with the people of the Torres Strait Islands, the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the Queensland Government and itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For what the Government will find is that in a matter of months when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> becomes independent, the matter may not be resolved and we may have what history is replete with, namely territorial disputes causing more than casual friction between the countries concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second and most important aspect is that on which I touched earlier concerning the question of our defence forces and the relationship between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In clause 3 of this Bill Australia proposes to transfer the power over foreign relations and defence to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These powers will cease to be reserve powers to Australia- reserve in the sense that when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> achieved self government on 1 December 1973 certain powers remained with the metropolitan powerAustralia namely, defence, foreign affairs, the supreme court and certain other stated matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to the House that other than the 5 pages of the statement made by the Minister for Defence  (Mr Barnard)  on 24 October, we have heard virtually nothing from this Government in regard to defence arrangements between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly, as I read them, these 5 pages of that statement seem to me to be a rhetorical embellishment of what we knew, that is that Australia has been abdicating its duties and its responsibilities in determining a proper and cohesive arrangement between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course one would get that from the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It tells us that the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> defence force will have a strength of 3,500 uniformed servicemen, with 2 infantry battalions, an engineers company, a patrol boat squadron and a landing craft squadron. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no question that ultimate responsibility Tor the defence of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will lie with Australia until the trusteeship agreement is terminated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that on the date on which <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> shall become independent the Trusteeship Agreement for the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> approved by the United Nations General Assembly on 13 December 1946 shall cease to be in force; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>requests the administering power to notify the Secretary-General of the date on which <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will accede to independence and on which the Trusteeship Agreement shall cease to be in force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The object of it clearly is that this, the 29th session of the United Nations General Assembly, meeting now, must do this because <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> may be independent before the 30th session of the General Assembly commences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why not tell us that what the Government is in fact doing is providing for an arrangement whereby when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> becomes independent all the Australian Government will have to do is write a letter to the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations telling the United Nations this and Australia’s answerability to that forum is finished and completed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ultimate responsibility for the defence of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will lie with Australia until the Trusteeship Agreement is terminated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there will be no forum in which to question it or to probe or to analyse what is transpiring unless there is such a holocaust in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that the relevant body of the United Nations is called together specifically to discuss that holocaust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the arrangements between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia therefore? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has 650 Australian servicemen at present serving within the ambit and control of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> defence force, as I understand it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian servicemen integrated in the force will be reduced to a figure of about 430 by the end of December next year, months after the date of independence proferred by the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, on the Minister’s own figuring, there may be 430 Australians serving in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But how many of these men will be integrated within the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> defence force? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many will be under the direct control and order of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> defence force itself? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remaining 423 persons will be playing a role along the guidelines produced by the Minister for Defence in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>,  Mr Albert  Maori Kiki, if there is any need to bring out the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> defence force in support of the police- in other words, in support of the civil power or to put down any form of uprising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not suggest that to inject a pessimistic note into the future of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one in this Parliament or outside it has spoken with greater confidence about the future of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and about its leaders than I have, but it seems to me that there is a profound duty- which has not yet been executed- on this Government to tell us just what will be the role of those servicemen if in fact there is any requirement for them to be used up there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Minister for Defence in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>- as the honourable member for Boothby reminds me by saying that it is a possibility- has put down guidelines as to the circumstances in which servicemen could be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To what extent will <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> be meeting some of the bill? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> be able to carry that expenditure into the turn of the century? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as aid is concerned, we will treat <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in a special relationship, as I term it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So many times I have said that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is deserving of additional aid over and above the aid other recipient countries obtain from Australia because <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been so closely associated with us at law, geographically and within the ambit of the trusteeship agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I would like him to send me more than a speech which he made in Parliament on 24 October because I believe that many Australian are concerned about the way in which our defence arrangements are being carried out in this country, let alone in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply say that the same degree of what has been termed delinquency in defence which has occurred in Australia applies as an accurate assessment of the defence relationship between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hopefully it does not apply, though, in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I have no objection to the transfer of control over the Supreme Court and local courts and over the provisions in the Judges’ Pensions Bill which provides pensions for Australians who were appointed prior to 1 December 1973 to serve on the Supreme Court of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these areas are contained within the Judges’ Pensions Bill and the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Government introduces legislation providing for the areas of defence and foreign affairs to be withdrawn from the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act in order that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> can rightly introduce its own legislation- I understand that it has a defence Bill before the House of Assembly now- the Minister ought to tell us what the Government is doing about foreign relations between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, not only in the lead up to independence but also in the post-independence period when these matters will be beyond our control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also the Minister ought to tell us what the role, the size, the structure and the cost of defence arrangements between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the days when we administered <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> we would never have come before Parliament with two important pieces of legislation and more or less described them- although the term was not used- as machinery Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has not sought to make political capital out of the Government’s administration of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have produced too much pace and pressure on the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not wish to disclose just what they are up to in relation to the use of Australian servicemen in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I make no point other than that, I ask that, prior to legislation coming into this Parliament, the Minister at the table, who is the Minister Assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Matters Relating to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, advise the Minister for Defence that I expect when he brings in Bills amending Australian legislation applying in the defence area, which also extends into <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, that he will let us know that he has completed discussions or that he has entered into arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the third occasion on which I have had the privilege or otherwise of following the honourable gentleman in debates relating to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia owe a debt of gratitude to the honourable gentleman for the contribution which he has made in regard to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many problems are associated with the independence of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate from the discussions at that time some of the problems which could face Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is to be the relationship between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in future? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There appears to be pressure by this Government and an interference with those in charge in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, which is completely unjustified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been responsible for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for a considerable time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many complexities within <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that in the present circumstances this Government and the people of Australia should show a greater sense of responsibility towards the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and their leaders, than perhaps we did when we had the responsibility for the trusteeship, the care and the progress of the future of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the 2 measures we are debating may merely be machinery matters, I think that they emphasise that not sufficient attention has been given by the Government to many of the problems that will be associated with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> obtaining independence and going into the future as an independent nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to follow on from the point of order that I made to elaborate a little on the thinking of this Government and also of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the House of Assembly of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in relation to the movement from self-government to independence for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is now exercising the rights of nationhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However at the moment Australia remains internationally responsible and liable for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> but it no longer exercises authority in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This unique situation which is unsatisfactory both to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia will not and cannot continue for very long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The self governing period is a difficult one for both <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While Australia understandably  wishes to end its responsibility for a people now finding their own future in their own way the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government is equally keen to finish with the frustrations of a self governing period and stand as an identity in its own right in world affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The second quote can be ascribed not to the honourable member for Kooyong but to the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the very moment we are talking here the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> defence legislation is before the House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it was only this morning that the House of Assembly in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was discussing one of the chapters of the Constitutional Planning Committee’s Report which also deals with defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly- not just the Government but the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly- is giving very detailed and very thoughtful consideration to how it sees defence relations between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, how it sees the defence of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>- the defence forces, the structure and the role of the defence forces of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In taking over this portfolio and in co-operation and discussions with the Minister for Defence  (Mr Barnard),  we had to make some very drasticchanges in the thinking that was prevalent In our relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the basic concepts and attitudes that we had to change was the view that was held that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s defence forces- the indigenous platoons and companies, the Pacific Island Regiment- were in fact a part of the Australian defence structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government moved very rapidly and in January 1973, just a month after it took office, renamed the composite group the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Defence Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The quotation I just read was from the decommissioning of HMAS ‘Tarangau’ and its recommissioning as the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Defence Force Patrol Boat Base. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have now reached the situation in Australia where there is no longer the old attitude that the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Defence Force was an integral part of the Australian Armed Forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was more a matter for soldiers than for police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing this perhaps the Government has passed on its philosophies and concepts to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government which it has applied in developing its concepts and attitudes towards the role of a defence force in a democratic country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the honourable member for Kooyong is aware of the statement made in August 1973 by  Mr Maori  Kiki, who is now the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Minister for Defence, Foreign Relations and Trade, when he said that the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government has repeatedly stressed its view that the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Defence Force should be used as a last resort for the maintenance of internal security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure honourable members understand from the background in which we have been operating, with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> finding its own way to its own point of view and its own attitude, that we have not been able to make definite statements but I can assure members of the Opposition that as soon as we possibly can make public the results of the continuing discussions we have had with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> these matters will be the subject of a statement in the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the points he omitted to stress was that this was a resolution which, although it had the full support of the Australian Government, also had the full support of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am of the firm opinion also that it will go down in history that this meeting of the Trusteeship Council will be the lust council meeting in which <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> appears on the agenda as a Trust Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there is no dichotomy between the attitudes and the views of the Australian Government, the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and many of the leaders of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on that resolution that went to the United Nations General Assembly through the Trusteeship Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a viewpoint that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has put. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I accept that many of the points are grounds for concern and because they are grounds for concern the Government is giving them continuous undivided attention in its discussions with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and in its discussions with the leaders in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be moving towards independence certainly before the end of 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is virtually independent now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we are seeking to do in this legislation is to provide through this Parliament the opportunity for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to assume these powers and responsibilities when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> asks for them to be transferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> defence legislation is now before the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By that stage <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be prepared and will be organising itself in January or early February next year to ask the Australian Government to transfer these responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has it been decided that Australia will not cede the Torres Strait Islands to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> against the wishes of the inhabitants and their right to selfdetermination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-81-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note that your Parliament envisages, as I do, that a treaty between Australia and an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will govern relations between the two countries in the matter of the Torres Strait. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-81-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The actual conclusion of such an agreement with an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is, of course, under the Constitution, a matter for the Australian Government and the independent Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-81-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is apparent that the rear fastening lugs of this unit were not properly inserted in the floor mounting rails and it is reasonable to presume that this installation error occurred when the seat unit was last replaced after a <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> flight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-99">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government has given a specific undertaking to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government that the help of Australians will be made available to that country for as long as that help is needed and desired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> (Staffing Assistance) Act 1973 sets out the framework under which this help is being provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Australian Staffing Assistance Group (ASAG) which was established under that Act on 1 December 1973, with the full support of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government, is to ‘make personnel available for the performance of services for the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the authorities of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The financial support provided by the Australian Government to Australians serving in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> under the ASAG arrangements, and in the South Pacific under SPAP and the CCES consists of the payment of salaries and allowances to the persons involved as well as their air fares to and from the developing countries concerned and related removal expenses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As members of the United Nations and as participants in cooperation in this region we, with others, such as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, also share a concern for the development of the region, for co-operation, consultation and for the security and wellbeing of all in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There would be positive effects for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, which is operating on Australian currency, and for Fiji which devalued in line with Australia; as these countries’ export industries will be more competitive on world markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-51-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Neither will it affect that significant part of the total program which is provided to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and not spent outside PNG or Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-51-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bilateral aid to countries other than <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, which will be most affected by the devaluation, will increase by an estimated 81 per cent, so the real value of Australia’s development assistance will increase considerably in 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-51-6">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest the honourable members opposite that they should not consider this matter on the basis of straight-out political opposition to what the Labor Party proposes but should seek to do for the Australian people what was done with respect to voting in the Australian Capital Territory and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill proposes other amendments to the principal Act, the most important of which concern the acceptability of savings held in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless appropriate amendments are made, changes to the banking system in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> associated with the granting of self-government may prejudice the possible eligibility of some Australians temporarily working and saving in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, under the terms of the present Act savings held with any bank in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would cease to be acceptable for purposes of the home savings grant scheme on and after the date of independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To overcome these problems, the Bill proposes amendments that will ensure that savings held with any bank in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in forms similar to those acceptable in the case of banks in Australia will continue to be acceptable until 31 December 1976, that is, until the last day on which savings held in Australia will be acceptable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>4m to the purchase of ships, materials and equipment and $70m to special assistance to facilitate transfer of the function of defence to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It would 6e in Australia’s interests to support <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the event of an external threat to that nation’s security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If this Government persists in allowing our defence capacity to deteriorate at the present rate we could finish up with a capacity inferior to that of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One purpose of this Bill is to amend the Australian income tax law so that when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> becomes independent it will be treated as a separate country for Australian tax purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our income tax law contains a number of special provisions relating to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some relate to an administrative position that came about in 1959 when a separate income tax was imposed in the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In broad terms, those provisions that provide special treatment for certain categories of income or expenditure related to activities conducted in either Australia or in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, but not in other countries, will be made inapplicable by the Bill so far as concerns income and expenditure related to activities conducted in an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subject to some exceptions, income derived from a source in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by Australian residents will be treated in the same way for Australian tax purposes as income from a source in other places outside Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Residents of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be taxed like other non-residents on income from sources in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A tax credit system at present applies in respect of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> income of Australian residents and in the converse case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed to retain this system in Australia after independence but, as the Treasurer  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  announced recently, the salary or wages of Australians working in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be exempted from Australian tax where <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> taxes the income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rate of withholding tax on dividends paid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> residents is half the general rate of 30 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We propose however to continue it in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s case after independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill generally requires the changes I have described to be synchronised with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also contains some other measures related to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of these is that, on a basis of reciprocity, people in receipt of pensions from Australia or <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are to be taxed only in whichever of the 2 countries they reside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another will confer an exemption from Australian tax on compensation and allowances paid under the employment security scheme now authorised by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> (Staffing Assistance) Act 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These amounts are paid to members of the Australian Staffing Assistance Group and other former expatriate officers of the Public Service of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on termination of their services there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They themselves introduced that procedure for Advisory Council elections in the Australian Capital Territory and they themselves selected the optional preferential procedure for the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is it that the optional preferential procedure is suitable for the people of the Australian Capital Territory and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> but it is not suitable for the Australian electorate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst on the subject of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the record of the OTC is very poor in regard to its relations with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Department of Posts and Telegraphs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>OTC failed to appreciate the policies of the present Government and the former Liberal-Country Party Government that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should enjoy a special relationship in line with its promised independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Australian Post Office was helpful and co-operative towards <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and gave considerable help with trained staff, OTC refused any assistance with staffing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>OTC always had an excuse for refusing calls for assistance from the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Department of Posts and Telegraphs and was endeavouring to retain control of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s external communications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>OTC, for example, refused to accept <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s national plan, agreed to by the Australian Post Office, to locate the ARM crossbar exchange at Lae and went ahead and built it at Madang, which is well away from what is deemed the copper centre of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> network. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s imminent takeover of its own external telecommunications network was ignored and thus <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> had to inherit a system inferior to what should have been implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To illustrate further the seriousness of the problem which has resulted from this decision, the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Department of Posts and Telegraphs has only recently let a contract for an international ARM cross-bar exchange to be constructed at Lae and this will go into service early next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that the installation at Madang was not only incorrect but has proved to be costly to the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>OTC has continued its wrangle with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> ever since and only last year was involved in a drawn-out issue over the best method to provide relief circuits between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia, even after an outside consultant had confirmed that relief was best achieved by a broad band cable between Madang and Cairns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regrettably, and I think mistakenly, the Minister launched an attack on the OTC’s record in regard to its relations with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Department of Posts and Telegraphs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>OTC always had an excuse for refusing calls for assistance from the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Department of Posts and Telegraphs and was endeavouring to retain control of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s external communications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The OTC has a connection with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> going back to October 1946 and is obviously proud of its record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> assumed self-government on 1 December 1973 and as a consequence took over the radio stations under OTC control, no fewer than 59 indigenous OTC staff were transferred to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Department of Posts and Telegraphs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, all significant action for the development of facilities in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was taken with the approval of the then Postmaster-General in accordance with the Overseas Telecommunications Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last 3 annual reports of the OTC reveal in the sidelined sections OTC’s record in the training of Papua New Guineans to ensure a smooth takeover on self-government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The OTC staff magazine ‘Transit’ reveals that OTC made avail.able a number of key personnel from its Aus- tralian staff for secondment to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Department of Posts and Telegraphs after self-government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to a new cable between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia the Press reports in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> ‘Post Courier’ for July 1974 reveal that accord exists between OTC and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to lay a $8m cable between Port Moresby and Cairnsnot Madang and Cairns, as incorrectly stated by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>OTC’s relations with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Department of Posts and Telegraphs have improved dramatically since selfgovernment, when responsibility for telecommunications in that country was taken over by the local people replacing the previous expatriate senior staff, mostly drawn from the Australian Post Office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have in my hand a reply to the statements I made in respect of the standing of OTC with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Gippsland might appreciate the fact that I happened to be the Postmaster-General at the time when I made the statements and I as aware of the fact that my counterpart in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> had to come all the way to Sydney to see me in an effort to overcome the difficulties that he was then experiencing with OTC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have in my hand a telex message which states that  Mr Kaibelt  Diria had said that he had to make special representations and come to Sydney because at that time the OTC was not in favour of the cable proposal and considered that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should have a satellite earth station instead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that it would be more expensive for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to have to operate such a station which would require further complex technologies which were not considered desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Income Tax Assessment Bill seeks to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act to permit <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to be treated for tax purposes as a separate country on its independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In essence, the legislation removes the special provisions which have applied in respect of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also agree that the special exceptions relating to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> income of Australian residents and the Australian income of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> residents should be continued as provided for by the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, I take this opportunity to place on record the Opposition’s view that it would be desirable for the Government to have as an objective the negotiation of a comprehensive double taxation agreement with the post- independence Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would also recognise the special relationship which Australia has and should continue to maintain with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is concerned, first of aU, with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and sets in legislative form the taxation arrangements which are to apply as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> moves towards independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parts of this Bill which I particularly wish to discuss are not those which are ostensibly the purpose for the Bill, namely, those alterations which become necessary to our taxation law because of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s projected independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we look at the Bill, the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech of the Minister Assisting the Treasurer, which seeks to focus our attention on the provisions concerning <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, we find tucked away, hidden here and there, what these other important respects really constitute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the South Australian Premier has objected to previous loans- loans sought for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>- but he has remained uncharacteristically silent on this occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-129-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation which I now introduce- this Bill and the next 4 Bills which I shall move be read a second time- is historic for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, for Australia, and for the European civilisation from which we Australians spring, for this is almost the last episode in the great postwar, post-imperial exercise of European decolonisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia was never truly free until <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> became truly free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this legislation is to enable <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to become independent on 16 September 1975, the date nominated by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation includes 4 Bills which are associated in various ways with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s move to independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these 2 statements the joint and continuing theme is that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was already providing leadership at all levels greater than that which Australia was able or willing any longer to provide in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Bill 1975 gives effect to an announcement the then Minister assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs in matters relating to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> made on 16 September 1974 that Australia would hand over to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> the administration of the Pocklington <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These islands are a small uninhabited group 130 kilometres east of the southeastern tip of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for the islands to be brought within the territorial scope of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, so that at independence that country will exercise full sovereignty over the islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also gives <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> authority to enact off-shore legislation in the area around the islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> already has authority to enact legislation dealing with its off-shore adjacent areas as denned in the Australian Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act, but these adjacent areas do not include Pocklington Reef Islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 4 of the Bill amends the present authorisation and enables <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to enact legislation dealing with off-shore areas other than those to which the Australian Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act applies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Loans Guarantee Bill 1975 seeks the approval of Parliament to the continuation of the Australian Government guarantee, provided for in section 75a of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act 1949-1975, in respect of loans raised by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government from Australian and PNG sources prior to independence until such time as the loans in question have matured and been repaid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would mention that loans <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has raised from overseas sources are guaranteed until final maturity under separate legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The guarantees to be continued by this legislation and those provided in respect of overseas borrowings have assisted <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in undertaking its borrowing programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> (Staffing Assistance) Bill 1975 is to amend the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> (Staffing Assistance) Act 1973 to introduce the new staffing aid arrangements which have recently been agreed between the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> (Staffing Assistance) Act 1973 established the Australian staffing assistance group as the framework under which former permanent overseas officers and contract officers from Australia could continue to serve in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after self-government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following a recent review of the future of these arrangements, it has been agreed with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government that the direct employment by the Australian Government of the 2700 members of the group- some of whom occupy senior and influential positions in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service- is not in the immediate or long-term interests of either <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accordingly, the 2 Governments have agreed that the group be wound up on 30 June next year and that new arrangements be introduced as from 30 June this year to encourage those officers in the group whose services are still required to transfer over to direct contract employment with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government as soon as practicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> (Staffing Assistance) Bill 1975 seeks to modify the present employment security scheme arrangements for those members of the group who agree to transfer over to direct contract employment with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The object of this Bill is to amend the Social Security Act to enable former residents of external territories, including <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, to qualify for social services pensions if they come to Australia to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Bills together constitute the final legislative act- the last legislative instrument- in the relations between the Australian Parliament and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government, towards a free united independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> know from their long experience- and let me re-state it- that Australia keeps her promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let this also be pointed out: A free <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is not a seventh State of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is not a premier of a dependent, a claimant, State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament- the House of Assembly- of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is representative of a truly sovereign nation with true, valid, genuine international independent standing in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House of Assembly of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is the Parliament of a sovereign nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> must aspire to that true sovereignty which no State under the Australian Constitution could ever have, or has ever had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as a nation does exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All other nations will have to sit up and take notice of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from now on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 16 September, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> achieves true and genuine sovereignty which no Australian State- the 6 former colonies- ever had, or can ever have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By these Bills, we give <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> its true international standing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from now on is going to need international aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if free <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> chooses in its own wisdom to augment that international aid from any other source, there can be, there should be, no complaint from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s responsibilities towards <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are inescapable, but <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has no special responsibilities towards Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has no more responsibilities towards Australia than any other independent nation has towards Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not divested ourselves of political authority over <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> just in order to keep it in financial bondage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will always have the first call on Australian aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to confine the limits of assistance to that which Austrafia alone shall give would be to confine the limits of independence of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By these Bills we intend to give <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> genuine independence- not a phoney independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have no national obligations or interest in getting rein.volved in colonial or post-colonial affairs in Portuguese Timor at the very time when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s imminent independence is leading to the ending of our colonial role there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What about the promise of the shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs for another $20m or $30m for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This year a further 120 soldiers will be released from duty in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> under the localisation program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Bills before the House are the final historic legislative instruments in the transfer of power to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They provide, by their passage through this House and the Senate, the removal of the legislative framework relating to Australian administrative and legislative authorities over <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our thoughts on this occasion ought properly to be on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and her future rather than on indulging in any form of self-congratulatory remarks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I endorse the Bills and the Opposition supports them, I have to note that I was somewhat disappointed that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in his speech on this legislation spent so much time on selfcongratulatory language about the role of the Australian Labor Party in allegedly decolonising <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and that by his incorporation in  Hansard  of lengthy statements from 1970 he proffered the oft-quoted view that it was he, as the then Leader of the Opposition, who really brought about this decolonisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was he who perceived the need to make these changes, in a somewhat dramatic way, speeding up the process and transferring more authority to the Ministers and the Assistant Ministers in the former United Party Government in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As members of the LiberalCouncil Party Government, we put the theme; we set the scene in conjunction with the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>; and we planned with that Government the transfer of the functions which has brought about this position today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, if I may say so in using the first personal pronoun, I was fortunate enough to participate as Minister for External Territories in the first of the series of constitutional talks between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in July 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the impetus of the transfer of activities in 1970 providing more responsibility and decision making for the Ministers in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, those talks in 1972 were the first government to government talks ever held between our 2 countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could talk about the development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from 1950 or 1960 onwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable members that there are more than 500 different tribes, speaking in excess of that many languages, in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the possible exception of the relationship between Britain and Fiji- I do not think even that is pertinent to this case- I would think that there are no other countries in the world that can say that they were on such close terms, following such earnest preparedness for independence, as Australia as the administering authority and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as the territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regrettably, the speech of the Prime Minister, apart from a welcome credit for what I did in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, did not underscore the role of the Liberal-Country Party Government sufficiently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, on 3 March 1 972, one month and one day after being sworn into the portfolio of External Territories, in addressing the University of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on the occasion of its graduation ceremony, among other things I said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes it should help <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> towards self-government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes it should help <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> towards self-government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bearing in mind the incorporation by the Prime Minister at the end of his speech of some of his previous statements, I seek leave to have incorporated in  Hansard  at the end of this address a speech on future relations between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> delivered by me to the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Institute of International Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is necessary to distinguish between Australia’s relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s own foreign relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to determine our relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> with proper regard to Australia’s own national interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should expect <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to do the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, we should not expect <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to look to us to decide what her national interests are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor as I have said earlier should we expect that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s national interests will not over the years, as they are better defined and as Papua New Guinean political leaders become more conscious of them, more and more diverge from Australia’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If mutual respect accompanies it, if we can succeed in avoiding gratuitous insults to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s nationhood and sovereignty, then that residual common interest will be of great importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My reason for quoting that is that we come to the stage where <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>- albeit she has had her own Foreign Relations and Defence Minister and has had her own staff at missions abroad- will now in law as well as in fact be conducting her own foreign policy and conducting it as it suits her interests and not necessarily Australia’s interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Independence BUI basically repeals the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the end of the formal association whereby Australia ceases to have any sovereignty over <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> at midnight on 15 September thus enabling the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Constitution to have effect on 16 September, that Constitution not being dependent on any legislative authority from Australia under this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> BUI transfers to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> the administration of the Pocklington Reef Islands, a matter announced by the Minister for Defence in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Loans Guarantee Bill provides the guarantees for loans entered into by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> prior to the date of independence- guarantees from the Aus.tralian Government until the maturity of such loans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourthly, the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> (Staffing Assistance) BUI introduces new staffing aid arrangements and provides for the elimination of the Australian Staffing Assistance Group, which covers approximately 2700 members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will be encouraged to work not within the ASAG but rather directly for the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reiterate, we are not opposed to these Bills for they bring about the sort of goal and aim that we shared with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government under the leadership of Michael Somare and which this Australian Government has carried on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We Will have formally executed the United Nation mandate to advance <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> politically, economically and socially. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout the constitutional process toward independence I have stressed that both the move to self government, which was agreed during our period in government, and this last step to independence were primarily motivated by decisions of the political leadership of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and responded to by ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia than has been given in this House in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be wiser to wait until <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is independent and executes her agreement to those relations or to whatever formal arrangements are to be entered into as an independent country so that there can be no accusation that she was coerced into those agreements before independence was reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The overriding thought that preoccupies one on this occasion is not to think back so much -both the Prime Minister and myself have probably spent too much time doing that thinking back over our administrations and congratulating ourselves for what we have done- but what <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is going to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is to be a separate entity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that we will be the major provider of aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a speech that is a little more churlish than I had hoped- but as a result of some of the remarks that were made last week- I nevertheless give endorsement to the Bills and give endorsement overall to the administration by Australia of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am certain that it has because of the calibre of the leadership at present in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The talent of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> leadership will take it a long way towards an effective independent state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without Australian public servants and members of the Administration in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and without the ability particularly of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> leadership- the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> people supporting that leadership- we would not be viewing the satisfactory solution in this movement towards independence that we are today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With all my reservations about the lack of preparedness for the post independence relations I wish nevertheless to conclude with congratulations to the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for the way in which it has received the powers that have been transferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier I obtained leave to incorporate in Hansard a speech entitled  ‘Future Relations Between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For those with a sense of history the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Independence Bill, is an historic event. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Independence Bill simply states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the expiration of the day preceding Independence Day, Australia ceases to have any sovereignty, sovereign rights or rights of administration in respect of or appertaining to the whole or any part of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>on 16 September 1975 <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is to become an independent sovereign state by the name of the independent State of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, having a constitution established, adopted and given to themselves by the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> acting through their Constituent Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nearly three-quarters of a century ago this Parliament began its direct involvement in the affairs of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that this is one of the occasions on which those of us who have been associated with the movement of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> through self-government and on to independence may reflect on the things that have happened to us in our administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not wish to dwell on the past, but I want to raise some of the problems- and they are problems- that will confront the relationship between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government recognises that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will continue to occupy a very special position in Australia’s policy but we do not see Australia as seeking or asserting an exclusive relationship with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will want to find its own place in the international community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of our concerns- and these are the areas that any 2 countries will get into a difference of opinion about, and I think it is important that any responsible member of this House should seek not to exacerbate such differences- is that we have provided and will continue to provide <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> with a very substantial and very significant amount of aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No country receives more aid per capita than <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the areas of difficulty has been in interpretation of a very generous offer that the Australian Government made to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in 1 974 when we said that we would provide $500m over 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make it very clear to the House and to the people in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> who have been deliberately misled by the intervention of the Opposition on this issue that we have maintained that promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the permission of the House I seek leave to incorporate in  Hansard  a letter from the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  dated 28 February 1974 to the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which spells out very clearly the nature of the commitment of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will recall that our discussions were held in the context of assurances which I had given on several occasions during 1973 as to the continuance of Australian aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the period after independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At our talks you referred to the importance of these assurances to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the early years after independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to confirm that from independence a united <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will continue to have first call on Australia’s expanding external aid program in future and, in particular, that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> can count on continuing to receive substantial amounts of aid from Australia over the next three years to underpin its new Improvement Program and to assist <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the early years after independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course Ministers of both our Governements recognised during our discussions that there were many factors which would have an impact on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s need for aid in the immediate future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the imminence of independence I am writing now, on behalf of the Australian Government, to inform you that on the basis of present indications a united <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> can proceed on the assumption that Australia will provide a total of at least $500m of expenditure on economic and social aid in one form or another over the three year period commencing in 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As in the past, the actual amounts of aid to be provided to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in each financial year will continue to be determined on an annual basis in the light of prevailing circumstances in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You may take this letter as a statement of the Australian Government’s position in regard to the continuance of Australian aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I understand that the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>,  Mr Somare,  said in the House of Assembly last week that the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock)  had assured his Government that the employment security payments were never considered as aid by the Liberal-Country Party Government when in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a statement that he issued as Minister for External Territories on 27 October 1972 he said that both the then Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government had accepted the Simpson report, the report which gave rise to the employment security scheme, in principle and, with minor exceptions which do not concern us today, the whole of the reports recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>s Paragraph 102 (1) (d) refers to payments of emoluments to former Commonwealth employees in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and says: … it would be reasonable that such payments be taken into account for fixing the level of Australia’s future aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said elsewhere in my report, it would be reasonable for the Commonwealth to take into account in fixing future aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> the costs involved under the employment security and future staffing arrangements I have recommended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, the government of the day, of which the honourable member for Kooyong was the Minister for External Territories, in laying down its Budget for 1972-73 included the total sum of $ 143m- I am taking this from Table 3, expenditures on aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>- an item entitled ‘termination and retirement benefits of overseas officers formerly employed by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government’ for the sum of $2. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say as the person who was responsible for the offer of $500m at Kirribilli House meeting in 1974 in the presence of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the Minister for Finance of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and the Minister for Foreign Relations of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as he then was, when I put forward that figure of $500m it was very clear in my mind, on the basis of the precedents that had been established by the previous Government, that the employment security scheme that the payments were included in the aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose we can look back a little at the people- not just the politicianswho have striven to make this possible, to provide the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> with the opportunity to measure their own steps, to decide their own fate in their own way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this is a very significant moment for all of us as Australians and particularly for those of us who have played a part in the evolvement of an independent state of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would particularly like to mention a number of Australian public servants who over the years as members of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service have dedicated themselves to working for the good of a people of another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this vast line of people was dedicated to the objective of bringing about economic and social developments in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for the benefit of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that I can say on behalf of both the Government and Opposition that we thank them for their contribution to the vitality and viability of a <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> entering into independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to  Mr Alan  Kerr who has followed through from the Department of External Territories to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Office of the Department of Foreign Affairs and who has worked closely with me over the last 18 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thank him for his dedication and for his deep and abiding interest in the problems of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thank also those who left in the normal effluxion of time; John Greenwell who is now in the Attorney-General’s Department; Miss Douglas who is still in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Office; and a lot of people who have put their all into making all these things come about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that all of us wish the people and the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> health and strength in undertaking the enormous task of being responsible for their own government and their own administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 16 September <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, our nearest neighbour, will become an independent nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australians have a particular place in their hearts for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>During the 1939-45 war many Australians gave their lives fighting the Japanese invaders in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I first visited <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the early 1960s and, since becoming a member of this Parliament, have visited that country on numerous occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I” believe that this augurs well for the future political stability of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could not help but think that had he and the many others who lost their lives in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> been alive today they would have lived over half a life span and would have contributed much to the development of our own country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the 1 939- 1 945 War, Australians and Papua New Guineans have a link of respect and friendship which was forged with the blood of the New Guinea campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has done a great deal for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the short time available to bring it to independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we did in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, we did in the interests of that country and its people and not in our own direct interest, although of course it is in our interest to have a stable and viable nation as our nextdoor neighbour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>True, there have been Australians in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>- I have met some of them- of whom we would not be proud, but they have been very much in the minority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a few weeks time <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will become an independent nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been most fortunate in having as its Chief Minister, and very shortly its Prime Minister, Michael Somare, a dedicated leader who has done much to prepare his country for the role it must play in the community of nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, the honourable member for Kooyong, on the good rapport that he has set up with the future Prime Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are and will continue to be a number of problems which face <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as it becomes an independent nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government does not feel able to give <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> more than a $2 10m allocation from the Australian Budget this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Australia’s grant includes $49m for the employment security scheme for expatriate Australian public servants who are losing their jobs because of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s independence, it is even less than it appears. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are very strong humanitarian reasons for increasing our overseas aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and one cannot help contrasting the attitude of the Australian Labor Party to overseas aid now that it is in government with its attitude when it was in Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government faces problems of a serious nature during its formative years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bougainville, with the Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd copper mine at Panguna, is now a wealthy island, and one can understand the people of Bougainville saying: ‘Why should we contribute to keeping the rest of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is to grow to nationhood it must do so as a strong and united country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With so much to be spent on development, it is likely that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will have little left over to provide for its defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With a left wing government in Timor, the USSR might well aim to extend its influence into <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any moves in this direction would need to be watched carefully by both the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What of Australia’s future relationship with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of the greatest importance to Australia that we have a strong, friendly, economically viable <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as our neighbour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must continue to channel a large percentage of our overseas aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> exports should be given most favoured treatment in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years we have been pouring money into <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> but have continued to buy such imports as tea from India and Ceylon and coffee and cocoa from South America, and one could go on and on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would to see Australia take positive steps to let imports from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which do not compete with Australian products enter Australia free of duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only would this sort of action be of substantial help to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> economy, but it would draw the 2 nations even closer together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I commend the governments of Australia, both present and past, for what has been achieved in bringing <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to nationhood and independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt there are many problems ahead for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and they probably Will be great problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that I am expressing the view of all Australians when I say that we wish <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> well in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with him that it is most regrettable that the debate on this subject should have been clouded as it has been with the acrimonious argument about the nature of Australia’s grants to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that when we are talking about the quantity of Australia ‘s aid that we have nothing great to brag about with respect to our contributions to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> or our foreign aid program as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was an important role and not the least of the important decisions he made was the appointment of  Mr Les  Johnson as Administrator of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another major factor, as will be seen by historians, in the transition was the rapport which was developed between the honourable member for Kooyong when he was Minister for External Territories and the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>,  Mr Somare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall very vividly living and working in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in 1965 when the then  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  went to a seminar at Goroka and was highly provocative as far as the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> were concerned when he said that he would be shocked if <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> did not have independence by 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the Labor Party has always wanted to overlook the history of Australia ‘s involvement in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a constant theme in Labor Party proposals for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that it was an embarrassment to have so-called colonial rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the prime motivation for expediting the program for self-government and independence rather than any thoughts of the welfare of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Defence  (Mr Morrison)  said that there would continue to be on the part of Australia substantial and significant amounts of aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The adequacy of our total foreign aid is quite a different question but, regardless of total aid, our aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> must be quantitatively high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the Minister who said that we expect <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to form other friends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in Australia must expect that there Will be a period in which <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will follow the experiences of other colonial or semi-colonial countries in forming friends away from its former colonial master but in time I think it is fair to expect that our relationship with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be one of a special nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have mentioned the curious history that has surrounded Australia ‘s involvement in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If names are to be named- the Minister did mention some- one ought to note the irony of the fact that in today’s newspapers there was reported the death of  Sir Donald  Cleland who was for 14 years the Administrator of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recent difference between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which has been the subject of debate between the Minister for Defence and the shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs has been most regrettable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia are lucky that it was  Mr Somare  ‘s coalition which came to power and that they did not remain in opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All Australians will wish the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> well and will expect that wish to be backed by appropriate Government assistance at all times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I should like to associate the National Country Party with what I see as a very important part of the development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as an independent nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In opening the twenty-sixth Australian Parliament on 12 March 1968 the then Governor-General, Lord Casey, included in his appeal the following statement on the future of the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not wish to refer further to that statement by Lord Casey but, before turning to some of the historical associations that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has with Europeans and with Australia, I did want to advert to 2 parts of that statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is his reference to the necessity for a subsequent special relationship to be worked out by the then government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the then government of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The history of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> before European contact is interesting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was known to the outside world, particularly in India, China and Malaya, well before Magellan entered the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is the world ‘s second largest island, and as such and because of its location in the South Pacific it was frequently raided for slaves by traders in the very early days of European contact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main contact with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> came between the 16th and the 19th centuries with the Dutch traders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is on that aspect that I wanted to talk about the association of my colleague, the former Minister responsible for the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>- the Minister for External Territories, the honourable Ceb Barnes- for it was during his time as Minister that the association of commercial development with political development became paramount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that he, together with  Sir Paul  Hasluck, was instrumental in enabling the very marked and rapid development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to the point which we have reached with this measure in this House today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that we recognise that in the succession of those 3 Ministers-  Sir Paul  Hasluck, his successor,  Mr Ceb  Barnes, and then  Mr Andrew  Peacock, the present member for Kooyong- the groundwork was laid for a very worthwhile special relationship with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both of them as Administrators and those many other distinguished Australians who served in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as Administrators, plus those many other distinguished civil servants who went from Australia to serve in the then Territory, helped to contribute towards an understanding between our countries which one might have thought would have served us well in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether that will continue because of what appears to be the necessity for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to look other than to Australia for assistance will depend very much on what happens over the course of the next 6 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has served <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in all fields of responsibility and administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In return quite a contribution has been made by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> people to Australia- as fellow workers, as military colleagues and in the development of careers through Australian schools and educational institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was for that reason that I drew particular attention earlier to that part of Lord Casey’s speech which concerned the development of a future special relationship between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer briefly to an article which appeared in this week’s issue of the  Far Eastern Economic Review,  which is headed ‘<span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>: Less to Spend ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has suffered as part of the Australian Government’s across-the-board cuts in public expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it includes defence expenditure, which has not previously been included, and substantial superannuation payments to Australian public servants ‘localised ‘ in mid-career- which <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has never accepted as a component of aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking the rise in Australian public service salaries of 28 per cent last year, together with an Australian-Papua New Guinean inflation rate of about 20 per cent, Australia’s aid grant for the year is calculated to provide <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> with 29 per cent less aid for social and economic purposes than last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in that sense of betrayal and the sense of frustration that so many in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> must feel that one must express concern in this last formal act in passing away from the Aus.tralian Parliament responsibility for the future development of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s imminent independencethen it is of very real concern to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We totally endorse these measures but we are concerned at the irresponsibility of the Ministers in the present Government at a time when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is going into independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the very real uncertainty of future events in East Timor, with the Prime Minister washing his hands of all concern for what might happen there and with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> going into independence with assertions being made by the Chief Minister about the implications of the cutback in Australian budgetary allocations for what is now the Territory but will shortly not be a territory, then of course, any Australian must be concerned for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On our side of politics we have a great deal of respect for the tremendous achievements that the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in its final days as a territory has been able to attain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In closing I would like to compliment the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for his remarkable achievements and those of his Government over the course of the last few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are now in a critical time with the British power gone, with the American power wavering and isolationist and with situations emerging to our north in Timor and in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which might easily bring a ring of fire round the north of the Australian continent before many months are out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will be interested to note that in the 10 years or so since West Irian became part of Indonesia about 500 people from West Irian have been granted the right of permissive residence in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party, when in government, instituted a requirement that each of the West Irianese coming into <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, for which Australia was then totally responsible, had to sign an undertaking- I remind honourable members that that was done at the instigation of the Liberal Party when it was in power- which stated: . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That he will not in any way directly or indirectly engage in any political activity whatsoever in connection with the country he left to seek refuge in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek leave to incorporate in  Hansard  a public statement made on 14 July 1972 which records the political conditions attached to permissive residence in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He talks of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the imposition upon refugees entering that country from West Irian of an undertaking not to engage in politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was because they were immediately across the border and it was feared that they may cause insurrection within West Irian and use <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as a base for the purpose of warfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is not on the border of West Irian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It applied to anywhere in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The word that these people had to give was similar to the word which many countries require from people similarly situated and was, of course, similar to the requirement of the preceding Australian Government in respect of some 500 people from West Irian who went to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and nearly 1000, 1 think it was, Colombo Plan students who have come to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-About 2 years ago much prominence was given by the media to the Government’s proposal to grant jurisdiction over all waters and islands north of 10 degrees south latitude to an independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Independence Day for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is scheduled for 16 September, I feel that it is appropriate to produce to the House some important and relevant information which has been furnished to me by a constituent of mine who is very well qualified to speak of activities and possibilities in our coastal waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would then allow the Government in Canberra to hand over jurisdiction north of 10 degrees south to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> without risking any accusation that Australia’s defence capacity was thereby being jeopardised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not believe the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock)  when he demands even more generous assistance to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We thought the legislation which was before the House last week was the last opportunity we would have to put our view on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That party will comprise the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  the Minister for Defence  (Mr Morrison)  in his capacity as Minister concerned with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> matters, the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  the Leader of the National Country Party of Australia  (Mr Anthony)  and me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to say on behalf of the Opposition that we look beyond 16 September when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> becomes independent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We look for a very close association with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> based not merely on the reservoir of good will which exists between the 2 countries, not merely on the geographic tie there is between us, but also on the undertakings we have made to guarantee the aid programs and to retain our close association with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> while it seeks the implementation of its aspirations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that a united <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be a successful <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and that the relationship between us which is so close now will continue for a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I join with the Minister for Defence in offering the Opposition’s warmest congratulations to the National Parliament of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and also to the people on the achievement of their independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the 2 preceding speakers have indicated, it is a formal motion and yet one which in its formal character reflects the sincere concern of all members of this Parliament and of all Australians for the future we see for the independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motion expresses our aspirations that a united <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will form an integral part of a regional association with Australia which will enable the people of both countries and of the region to live in harmony and in continued progress in the years ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We congratulate the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on their achievement and trust that they may be able to achieve those aspirations which aU their people must have at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That this resolution be conveyed to the  Speaker  of the National Parliament of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further two are being overhauled prior to presentation to the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to speak upon the question of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and certain aspects of Australia’s relationship with that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am prompted to do so for 2 reasons: Firstly, because like you,  Mr Speaker,  I was in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> during the independence celebrations and, secondly, because of some of the reporting in the Australian media since the independence celebrations which has given in my opinion an unfair picture of the problems facing the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly do not wish to appear as an apologist for the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government but I do wish to appear as a member of this Parliament who worked in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and who probably has a better appreciation of the problems of that country and the policies of that Government than have the reporters who have aroused my ire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the Ministers and other members of Parliament admitted that they had tears in their eyes when the Australian flag was lowered and again on the following day when the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> flag was raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is doubtful whether the average citizens of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> can really conceive the magnitude of the problems which lie before their country and its leaders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These men represent all parts of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and are likely to be its leaders for many years to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Public Service continues to grow and this Will be a problem for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The traditional sense of kinship obligation will make this a distinct probability in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidence of the vacuum created by Australia’s departure strikes one quickly on returning to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> but <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s leaders are aware of this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After a period of consolidation we may expect that this vacuum will be filled by overseas experts recruited by the new Government in accordance with policies aimed at maintaining firm control of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s resources in the Government’s hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is often observed that one of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s greatest difficulties lies in the fragmentation of its language and culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is a potentially rich country, and with improved technology much of its mineral and oil wealth will be capable of extraction on a commercial basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last night the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Treasurer,  Mr Julius  Chan, presented the independent country’s first Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a matter upon which the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government feels most upset. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that all Australians will recognise our obligation to assist <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> with technical and material aid for decades to come, and also to extend trade between our countries for the benefit and prosperity of both. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will continue to be the major recipient, receiving an estimated $2 10m in 1975-76. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus foreign aid will comprise 87.5 per cent of the Budget allocation to the Foreign Affairs Department in the next financial year and 55 per cent of this will go to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In specific areas, Australia has said it will grant $500m over the period 1974-77 to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to the situation surrounding <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already given figures on the amount of aid for which Australia is committing itself in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, in the midst of all this we have had the spectacle of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s Chief Minister negotiating in Canberra for increased aid, going back to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> dissatisfied, and then the wrath of the newspapers and the Opposition coming down on the Government because it was not doing enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the years when Australia was prosperous and economically stable I unequivocally supported our bilateral aid programs, particularly our aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and under the Colombo Plan- which was initiated by this country some 25 years ago- our contribution to international education and training schemes, our food aid and disaster relief and other emergency relief programs and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, we have profound commitments to some countries, particularly <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact our aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> skews most of our aid programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem with Australia’s aid program is that so much of the total allocation is skewed towards <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable members know, there has been quite a deal of debate between the governments of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia with respect to the agreements entered into. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1975-76 development assistance budget allocates $207.9m as aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been approximately maintained in real terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s position compares favourably with the percentage increase in the total aid budget of 14.9 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has allocated over 55 per cent of its total aid budget to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Approximately 100 of the 692 people are employed servicing staffing assistance to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and some 140 people were employed in respect of head office financial and management support of departments overseas and the head office staffing itself here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not appropriate for me to answer a question of that kind because  Dr Coombs  was not acting for me alone in matters concerning the border issues affecting <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government might well take heed of the financial oil policy announced by one of the newest independent countries in the world- <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a leaf out of the book of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government which this Labor Government could well take heed of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I only wish the present Federal Labor Government had the same sentiments as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has-  and the terms and conditions specified will reflect this aim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time the guiding principle, stated many times before, is that the investor should receive a reasonable return on his investment but a high proportion of any income in excess of that reasonable return should go to the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me take up the last remark of the honourable member for Stirling  (Mr Viner)  regarding the policies of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us have a look at what happened in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> particularly in the copper development and at the contribution the Australian Government made to ensure that the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> had an equity in the copper deposits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to see the honourable member for Stirling get up in Port Moresby and suggest that perhaps the same equity would be sufficient for Papua New Guineans as now applies to Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that it was our contribution, from Australian taxpayers’ money, that bought for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> a fair equity in the copper mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also knows the keen interest that the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has shown in what it deems to be a fair and reasonable return from taxation of the profits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member would know that the sense of balance the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government has is the same as any reputable country would have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member knows the difficulties of Kennacott in perhaps abandoning some of its explorations in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the  Chairman, Mr Roy  Turner whom I know, and who has a lot of practical experience as a private solicitor acting on the panel of the New South Wales Public Solicitor, other persons who were on the Committee were distinguished and experienced in the field of legal aid, including  Mr Justice  Lalor who for many years was Public Solicitor in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and for whom I worked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- On 7 October the Premier of Queensland, in a statement to the Queensland Parliament, accused the Australian Government of double-dealing and blackmail over the question of the border between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They affect the long-term relationships between Australia and the newly-independent nation of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue of the border between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia is not one which was created by or is peculiar to the policies of this <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need for an agreed definition of that boundary was an inevitable consequence of the policy of independence for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While there have been differences in judgment about timing between my Government and its predecessors, there has not, I believe, been any difference on the issue that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> independence had to be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the views of the Australian Government about the rights or wrongs of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> claim for an adjustment to the border, that Government- whatever its political complexion- would have been faced on the one hand by a clear demand for adjustment by the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and on the other by the unwillingness of the Queensland Government to accept any change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government, therefore, from the outset, made clear its position that the location of the border should be determined by negotiation between the Australian and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> governments, with the Australian Government accepting the responsibility to take account of the constitutional and other interests of the Government of the State of Queensland and particularly to protect the interests of Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, within a fortnight of our coming into office, I wrote to the Premier suggesting discussions between officials of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, Queensland and Australian governments to help resolve these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In discussions in January 1973 with  Mr Somare,  then Chief Minister of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, I expressed quite clearly the Government’s desire to resolve this issue in friendly negotiation and indicated that the Government would be most reluctant to accept a settlement of the issue which was unacceptable to Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was evident at this time that complex negotiations between the Australian Government and the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would be necessary to resolve these issues and that the Australian Government would need, in parallel with these, to be carrying on discussions with the Torres Strait Islanders and with the Government of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seemed to me important, in preparing for these negotiations, that I should take action to ensure that the interests and views of Torres Strait Islanders were at all times taken into account in discussions within the Australian Government Administration leading up to negotiations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> or to discussions with the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The consultations on Yam Island and at Daru were discussions between the Islanders and the coastal residents of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore the Department of Foreign Affairs has taken action to acquaint officials of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> with the views expressed in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the morning of Saturday, 20 September, time was taken out from the normal agenda of the conference to enable  Dr Coombs  to outline to the chairmen the content of  Sir Maori  Kiki ‘s letter of 8 September, to draw attention to the issues which had emerged in discussions with Queensland and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and to draw the Islanders’ attention to the need to consider them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They stated, however, that, if a border through the protected zone was necessary to prevent a serious dispute and possible ill-will between the Governments and people of Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, they would be prepared to consider accepting it, providing their essential interests were protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Conference of Torres Strait Islands Chairmen decided that while they wished to remain free to consider the future of the border between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and their attitude towards it, the following statement could for the present be used by the Australian Government in its discussions as a guide to Torres Strait Islanders’ attitude to the questions involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Islanders believe that the present discussions between the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, Australian, and Queensland Governments about the border between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia are based on a misunderstanding of the traditional relationship between Torres Strait Islanders and coastal residents of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Mainland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If some change in the border is necessary, the Islanders see no reason why it should run through the proposed protected zone which they believe could be maintained as a region within which Islanders and the coastal peoples of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> bordering on the Straits could live harmoniously as they have in past ages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They believe that the Governments of Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> could work out a form of joint control which would be adequate in a zone where the protection of the environment and the embargo on mining and oil drilling would make many of the issues requiring the exercise of sovereignty unlikely or less difficult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and people and the Governments and people of Queensland and Australia, the Islanders would be prepared to consider accepting such a border providing the following conditions are met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Governments of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, Australia and Queensland to agree to the establishment of an environmentally protected zone or marine park controlled so as to ensure the preservation of the total environment of the Torres Strait- the Islands, reefs and cays, the sea and seabed, and the air above it including the natural wild life and marine creatures as the basis for the traditional way of life of the Islanders and the coastal people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> bordering on the Straits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This protected zone to extend from the coast of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> bordering on Straits to include all areas of the Straits used by the Islanders including Bramble Cay, the Barrier Reef, Deliverance Island and Turn Cay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That there be complete embargo on new mining and oil drilling or exploration for ten ( 10) years; the embargo to be continued thereafter unless agreed by the three Governments after the views of the Representatives of the Islanders and coastal residents of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> have been taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If any Treaty or Agreement relating to this matter is to be terminated other by agreement or by one party, the Governments agree to confer with the Representatives of the Islanders and of coastal residents of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and if agreement cannot be reached about arrangements to follow those provided for in the Treaty or Agreement the question to be referred to the International Court or to some other Arbitrator acceptable to the Representatives of the Islanders and coastal residents of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-by leave-With a degree of false modesty I put forward the proposition that despite the visits that Australian politicians have made to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, no one in this Parliament has discussed either at such length or so frequently as I have the question of the Queensland-<span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> border with members of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also submit that no one has raised in this Parliament since the Australian Labor Party was elected to Government the question of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>-Queensland border as frequently as I have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within daysnot weeks, not months, but days- of becoming Prime Minister, the honourable gentleman said that, unilaterally, he would move the border between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I plead with the Government to recognise not merely the views of the Papua New Guineans and the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members want to talk about maintaining good relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, I just remind them that the reason independence was accepted on 16 September, supported earlier by the overwhelming majority of the members of the House of Assembly, was that the present Prime Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the former Chief Minister, accepted implicitly and frequently the Prime Minister’s constant undertakings to grant increased aid at the time of independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fancy during a luncheon adjournment drawing up a 3-page agreement between parties such as Islanders, a nation such as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister knows that what he put to this Parliament tonight is, regrettably, one of the worst statements promulgated by an Australian Government in regard to relations between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reiterate, if I need to, the views and the sympathies I have with those in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not just the Queensland Parliament or the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has been told month after month when debates on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> have come into this Parliament, and every time I have supported the Government’s legislation, expressing not only the interest of Australia but also that of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have pointed to the problem of the border between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By following a course of constitutional anarchy he has jeopardised relations not just between a Labor Government and a Country Party-Liberal Party Government in Queensland, but between 2 countries, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a Government, it introduced that system for elections in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A strange amendment proposed by the Opposition would eliminate these words: ‘Australian Government School’ means a school conducted by Australia, by the Administration of a Territory or by a prescribed authority, and includes a school conducted in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by a prescribed institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is still at this moment called the Commonwealth Teaching Service provides 250 teachers on secondment in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of them are staffing indigenous schools, but the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> appears to have indicated that it would like purely Australian schools to continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very clearly, with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the Commonwealth it is going to be confusing to have Commonwealth schools instead of Australian schools in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, because the people in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> think of us as Australia; they do not think of us as the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not respond in any way to my invitation to consider the suggestion of calling the Teaching Service either the Commonwealth Territories Teaching Service or the Australian Territories Teaching Service or in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> calling it perhaps the Australian Overseas Teaching Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we know, as of recent weeks <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is no longer a Territory of Australia but is an independent country where Australians employed under the Act which this Bill seeks to amend are still engaged in teaching work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We wish to maintain the distinction of roles between the teachers teaching in the services of New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia, which operate geographically in the respective States, and the teachers in the service which operates in the Territories of the Commonwealth or, in the case of those teachers engaged in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, which operates overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be deprived of over $200m which is absolutely essential for it to maintain services in that community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Defence co-operation programs with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, New Zealand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore will be devoid of funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Government tables documents relating to interim defence arrangements between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> it should’ not sweep aside the reality that for  2Vi  years it was warned that upon <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s independence it ought to have firm arrangements to determine the relationships between the 2 countries and should not wait until after independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So whether it is in the area of strategic assessment, in the area of application of funds for the Army, the Navy or the Air Force or between our closest independent neighbour, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and ourselves, the defence expenditure does not stand up to the analysis that Government supporters were putting forward tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Specht Roe and Boughton, editors of the publication  Conservation of  Major Plant  Communities in Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>  (July 1974) (known as the Specht Report) use the structural classification ‘closed-forest’ to include most of those forests popularly known as ‘rainforest’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government believes Australia has a continuing responsibility to assist in the progress of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and will, therefore, continue a comprehensive program for cooperation and development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other provisions in the Bill are of a minor nature, mainly concerned with the deletion of provisions covering flights to and from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be difficult for those members who represent constituencies of three or four square miles to comprehend an electorate such as Leichhardt which stretches north from the town of Innisfail for 1200 kilometres to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> border and west from the Great Barrier Reef for 1200 kilometers to the Northern Territory border. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other international problem lies in the definition of the border between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the Torres Strait. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Governor-General’s Speech refers in particular to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it to be of the utmost importance that we continue our aid to and trade with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> at the highest possible level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has the best government it can possibly have at the present, and I am afraid to say that if that government were not in power <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> could only have a government infinitely worse, with no prospect for a long time of getting a better one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is imperative that the Australian people, regardless of which government is in power, acknowledge the need for the government to give urgent and generous assistance in many forms to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and to give that assistance now, otherwise we might find ourselves expending all sorts of large sums of money in regrettable episodes in an effort to retrieve a situation which could develop from our failure to support the present <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> cannot resolve that problem there is little hope for mankind, because if ever there were 2 nations with an historical affinity, they are the two. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned that matter because one hears from time to time of certain officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs, as distinct from the Minister, who are under the delusion that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> politicians can be bought off with more money and that they will drop their border claims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: What progress was he able to make in his discussions with the Premier of Queensland last week in persuading the Premier to make the statutory appointments to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the Great Barrier Reef Consultative Committee and to facilitate the demarcation of the border between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-The honourable gentleman has referred to a complex matter in which, as he knows, his State, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Torres Strait Islanders all have a very real interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the best way of making sure that the Tones Strait Islanders are able to pursue in perpetuity their traditional way of life, unhampered and unfettered, as they would want, for as long as they would want, is to make sure that the Commonwelth Government is enabled to come to a speedy resolution of this matter with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>An unsettled situation between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia will ultimately lead to a disturbance and lack of certainty for the future life of the Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In wishing to come to a firm agreement with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on these matters we have in mind not only concern for the continued, most useful and happly relationship between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia and for making sure there is .a resolution of the border issue but also our determination to make sure that the Torres Strait Islanders will be able to pursue their way of life, as they would want, in perpetuity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It still requires some dedicated persons to go to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>safeguarding the interests of the Torres Strait Islanders in discussions preparing for the negotiations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in relation to the Australian/<span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> border; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, the aid program that we have negotiated with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, which is at a minimum of $930m, is in real contrast to the breaking of the commitment to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by the previous Government in the last financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The long-term value of a successful eradication campaign would be influenced by the likelihood of further introductions of the fly from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> or other islands to the north of Australia where it is known to occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-15">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will cause them serious concern and not assist in achieving a proper definition of the situation between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia which will be in the interests of the long term stability of relationships between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia and which at the same time will do perhaps more than anything else to make sure that the Torres Strait Islanders can live in their traditional way undisturbed for the rest of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>and (2) An Office of the Australian Development Assistance Agency was established within the Department of Foreign Affairs on 1 December 1973 by bringing together the Canberra-based staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs, who had been engaged on aid functions, and the staff from the former Department of External Territories who were still required to carry out ongoing aid functions in respect of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as well as to service the needs of the Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-12">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> (Stalling Assistance) Act 1 973- 1 975 to wind up the Australian Staffing Assistance Group arrangements in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on 30 June 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Staffing Assistance Group was established under the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> (Staffing Assistance) Act 1973 and came into being on 1 December 1973, the date on which responsibility for the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service was transferred to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time there were some 4500 overseas officers of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service and the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Police Force who had been appointed as permanent officers or engaged as contract officers by former Ministers for External Territories under the former <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> (Staffing Assistance) Act 1973 these officers, together with a small number of temporary employees of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service and staff of the Electricity Commission who were contributors to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Superannuation Fund, were separated from their respective <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> services and became the Australian Staffing Assistance Group, or ASAG, as it has become known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Group was to make personnel available to occupy and carry out the duties of established positions in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service and other areas of public employment until Papua New Guineans became available to fill these positions, and the services of the ASAG personnel were no longer required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only personnel who have been added to the Australian Staffing Assistance Group since its establishment in 1 973 have been those officers of the Australian and State governments who have been seconded to ASAG for service in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In June last year the former Australian Prime Minister and the then Chief Minister- now Prime Minister-of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> announced jointly that, following a review of staffing assistance arrangements, it had been agreed between the 2 Governments that the direct employment by Australia of the 2900 or so personnel who were then in ASAG- many occupying senior and influential positions in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service- was not in the immediate or long term interests of either <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime, new arrangements would be introduced to encourage those personnel in the Group whose services were still required, to transfer to direct contract employment with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On Australia’s part, the arrangements took the form of special conditions under which personnel could voluntarily terminate their employment in the Australian Staffing Assistance Group in order to accept contract employment with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These conditions were settled after full consultation with the staff association representing ASAG employees, and included leave pay concessions, deferment or preservation of certain existing entitlements, accelerated payment of compensation instalments according to the period of contract service with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and certain superannuation and retirement benefits concessions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> (Staffing Assistance) Act 1973 was amended in September 1975 to facilitate the introduction of these special conditions, the detailed provision of which will be made by regulations under the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s part, the new arrangements involved negotiation with the staff association of terms and conditions of contract employment broadly equivalent to those which applied to personnel of the Australian Staffing Assistance Group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> (Staffing Assistance) Termination Bill 1976, which is now before the House, consists of 34 clauses, most of which are of a machinery or ‘savings’ nature to preserve the residual entitlements of personnel when the Australian Staffing Assistance Group is wound up on 30 June 1 976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To this end, the Bill provides that personnel of the Group who have not voluntarily terminated their employment by 30 June 1976, either to accept contract employment with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government or to return to Australia, will have their employment terminated on that date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is resulting in serious liquidity problems for both the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Superannuation Fund and the Contract Officers’ Benefits Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for the operation and administration of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> schemes and two pre-war schemes- the Papua Superannuation Fund account and the New Guinea Superannuation Fund- to become, from 1 July 1976, the responsibility of the Commissioner for Superannuation, a position that will come into being under the Superannuation Act 1976 on that date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regulations are being prepared to enable those contributors to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> superannuation scheme, who so elect, to continue to contribute until the expiration of their first contract with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government or until 30 June 1978, whichever occurs first. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, however, is a consequence of the speed with which events have moved in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> ‘s attainment of independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Staffing Assistance Group was devised as a mechanism to provide the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government with the professional, technical and high level administrative expertise which it needed, particularly in the period between selfgovernment and independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new arrangements under which personnel of the Australian Staffing Assistance Group are encouraged to transfer to direct contract employment with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government will, however, enable <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to retain most of that expertise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I  inform the House that the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  left Australia last evening for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> where he will be having further discussions on the Torres Strait border issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What was constructive about slashing aid and relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he remember that in the middle of his Government’s extravagant and irresponsible spending he found it necessary to cut aid to our closest neighbour <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are all forms of overseas aid, apart from aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, to decline in real terms in the coming financial year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I do not believe it serves any purpose to exclude <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from aid programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable member is not aware of it, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is an independent country, and it is quite legitimate- it always has been- for Australian governments to include aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, unless you are a colonialist, in their aid programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find great difficulty comprehending why the honourable gentleman excluded the figures for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, unless it was to make a point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must recognise that the previous Government was the first government to reduce aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did so at a most sensitive period for the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The arrangements we worked out for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, which we have always maintained we must have - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any assessment of Australian foreign relationships and defence there is a growing belief that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> could well become a problem area of worrying proportions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To speculate on this becoming a reality is to ponder a <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> deprived of its only substantial and permanent revenue- the great mines on Bougainville. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could not conclude my comments on <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> without pointing out that Australia can take much comfort from the fact that the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock)  is our Foreign Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  sincerity of purpose has been appreciated by the leaders and people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> at all levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second level is a situation such as we have seen in relation to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> or Timor where sudden confrontation situations can develop literally overnight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Extraneous references to the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> have also been removed from some provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I direct a question to the Foreign Minister which concerns the Torres Strait border with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister will remember announcing in June of this year that agreement in principle had been reached with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Foreign Minister concerning a new seabed boundary and a protected zone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> any international support for its position? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s own international support is a matter for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to judge for herself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, of course, primarily his duty to look after what he assesses to be <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s own interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we require are discussions between the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and our own Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 32 of the Science and Industry Research Act 1 949 requires the approval of the Minister for the exercise of any power or function by the organisation which exclusively affects <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> or Norfolk Island and requires the Minister to consult the Minister for External Territories before giving such approval. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill seeks to repeal section 32, thus recognising the independence of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the fact that there is no Minister for External Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the House would know, there is an agreement between the Australian Government and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government about the shareholding of Air Niugini. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has 60 per cent of the shares, Ansett has 16 per cent, TAA has 12 per cent and Qantas has 12 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is that the Prime Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has written to the Prime Minister of Australia saying that the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government wants to take up the option that is in the agreement between the 2 governments for it to purchase the shares held presently by TAA and by Qantas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must also point out that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is an independent nation and the agreement provides for the takeover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In due course the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government will be informed of the attitude of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that of that amount, a special allocation of $238m is being made to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will note the significance of the contribution that is being made to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and I will return to that shortly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can remember speaking in this chamber 5 years ago when the Russians were beginning to make their influence felt more particularly in the Malaysian Peninsula by establishing formal relationships and doing the sorts of things that could well be done by one country or another in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us return to the subject of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say again that we are contributing $228m in the 1976-77 financial year to the assistance of the maintenance of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as an independent nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is one very obvious fact relating to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and that is that if Bougainville should secede a very precarious and sensitive situation would arise because the only real and substantial source of income of that nation would suddenly disappear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that the Bougainvillians will ever adopt in their hearts and minds the general attitude towards <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that they are part of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should their feelings grow to the point where they secede from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> a very sensitive and delicate situation would arise in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> because that nation would quite suddenly find that it has been deprived of its only source of economic vitality, that is, the income that it derives from the huge copper project on Bougainville. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At that time no-one expected independence to come about in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as early as it did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should face up to the fact not with apprehension but with at least some realistic understanding of the possibilities that should the rather grim situation arise where <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is deprived of its only form of financial vitality it could become the base for people who might like to buy in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Mr Chairman, it is with great pleasure that I rise to support the estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs, and in particular the bilateral aid estimates for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having been fortunate enough to have served in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Administration for 2 years during the fascinating period immediately prior to self-government and independence, I can assure the Committee that our continuing assistance to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> undoubtedly is one of the most significant and useful aspects of our foreign aid program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our expenditure for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in 1976-77 will be more than $22 8m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our current aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> forms part of the commitment this Government made in March this year to provide $930m to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> over the 5 years commencing from 1976-77. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This commitment ensures that the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will receive at least $180m in direct social and economic aid for each of the 5 financial years commencing from 1 July this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a definite guarantee of a certain minimum level of assistance will be of enormous advantage to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in planning its own Budgets and general financial arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Committee will be aware, on 16 September this year <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> celebrated its first birthday as an independent nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was just over a year ago that Australia voluntarily relinquished control over <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after 9 1 years of rule in Papua and some 6 1 years of rule in New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That period of Australian administration of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is, by and large, a period that this country can look upon with reasonable satisfaction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That we made some mistakes in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> there is no doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, on balance, the record of Australian governments of all political persuasions and of the officers of our administration on the spot in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is both competent and just. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we have left <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> with 3 notable legacies which our continuing aid should help to maintain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difficult terrain of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, coupled with its 600 or so tribal groupings, meant that a highly decentralised system of district administration was in fact the only viable means of running the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a measure of the effectiveness of the administrative system which we left behind that the new Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has seen fit to more or less leave it intact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only during the Japanese occupation of part of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> during the Second World War did we temporarily place the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> under military authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, we properly prepared <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for a workable system of parliamentary government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each of these 3 legacies I have mentioned of Australian rule- a sound administration, the maintenance of law and order through civil courts and the civil police, and a workable, democratic Parliament- will, with our continued support of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, help guarantee her stability and that of the surrounding region until well into the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a future <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has ahead of her if her current performance is any guide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s main export productscopper, copra, coffee, cocoa and tea- continue to hold their position firmly in international markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But overshadowing all these favourable developments is <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s immense potential for the development and export of her vast mineral wealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Current exploration work by the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd at Ok Tedi is but one of several projects that will eventually make <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> one of the wealthiest nations in the South East Asian and the South West Pacific areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is worth noting that faith in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s future is obviously shared by that nation’s white population as the vast majority of the permanent residents of that section of the population have remained there since self-government and independence and seem to be content to remain for the years to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before concluding I would like to refer briefly to one other specific item in our aid estimates for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That expenditure is indicative of the enormous importance of an efficient civil aviation network to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, for without it the interior of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would still be an unexplored and undeveloped wilderness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore commendable that our aid program has recognised the importance of the necessary support facilities for aviation in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by saying how appropriate it is that the present Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  still has as his responsibility <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During his time as Minister for External Territories and in the period since then he has been in large measure responsible for the excellent relations Australia now enjoys with independent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our aid program to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is a reflection of the continuing goodwill between our 2 nations, and without hesitation I warmly commend it to the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I must add that I support the general approach of the Government of aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both the level and the forward commitment are well tailored to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> ‘s needs, for the level of aid is such that the growth of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government spending will have to be financed internally while the forward commitment encourages the planning that will make for effective development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, by giving untied rather than project aid, Australia is encouraging <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to take full responsibility for its own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other members of the Committee are  Sir Cecil  Looker, a former  president  of the Austraiian Associated Stock Exchanges- he has also held the position of  chairman  of the Melbourne Stock Exchange and director of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Development Bank- and  Mr R.  T. Madigan,  chairman  of Hamersley Holdings Ltd and of IOL Petroleum Ltd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government was fortunate in securing the services of  Mr Hay  who has a distinguished record as a diplomat and as Administrator of the Territory of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from 1967 to 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite sure that as a conscientious officer and former administrator of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> he is skilled in administrative processes and is able to link into the report the views of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and some Aboriginal community leaders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all 3 major international issues involving Indonesia in the last 15 years the Liberal-National Country Party coalition has played an essentially weak and subservient role- during the confrontation with Malaysia, the takeover of West <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the invasion of East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Fraser  (Mr Fry)  and  Mr John  Middleton of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> greatly impressed delegates when they spoke on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Events in Timor have caused considerable anxiety in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which shares a common border with Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said in my opening remarks an impressive speech was made by John Middleton of the Parliament of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> at the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association’s conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Might these generals not be tempted to repeat their operation against East Timor at a time when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is still facing serious problems in establishing national unity? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will become the last island of democracy if we are not careful because, as my friend, the honourable member for Hunter said, what is to stop <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from being next? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One only has to read the telexes hung in the refreshment room to know that the Chief of Staff in West Irian was asking the Chief of Staff of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to suppress the people from crossing the borders there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has also demonstrated its concern for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> veterans by providing substantial increases in their pensions as from November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These increases have been effected by regulations under the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> (Members of the Forces Benefits) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He patronised <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by expressing partisian views about internal party politics there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has patronised <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and managed to infer that Washington is naive in pursuing a policy of  detente  with Moscow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other political matters in relation to ASEAN were widely discussed as was the future of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, cultural exchanges, a common view about aid and the way aid should be brought forward, and a common view about inflation and the need to overcome inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, what will the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> think of this sell out, especially when it has come about so readily and has been accompanied by a script of deception that could almost have been written by the Jakarta generals themselves? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The program forges new initiatives as far as our aid programs outside <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Prime Minister aware that when the Prime Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> visited China recently he was welcomed with various greetings which referred to his country as now being released from colonial aggression? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: Will he consider making an appropriate response to what I consider a gratuitous insult to Australia and to tens of thousands of Australian citizens who have lived and worked for many years in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Nobody in Australia and, I believe, nobody in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will accept that as in any way being an accurate description of the relationship which the 2 countries have at the present time or have had at any time in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the introduction of the Bill last year, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has become independent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill protects the long service leave rights of persons who were in public employment in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> prior to independence, who worked for the independent state of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after independence and who then entered, or in the future will enter, Commonwealth employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 47E of the Public Service Act to protect the sick leave rights of persons who were in public employment in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> prior to independence, remain there after independence and then enter Commonwealth employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, of course, we sold them to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly a fanpart of it goes to one area, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, where we do have economic, moral and social obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of looking at the legalities of the situation it is interesting to look at how our own High Court, in dealing with cases which I think related more to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, has been in a bit of a dilemma in the past as to whether its powers were virtually under section 122 of the Constitution or what is known as the external affairs power, which is placitum (xxix) of section 51. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time of which I spoke the then Court of Appeal was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: Since the Premier of Queensland will be holding discussions on Fraser Island with him in Canberra today, will the opportunity be taken to discuss other current matters, recently raised more than once in the Parliament, such as the seabed boundary between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Aboriginal health? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was an agreement entered into between the then Department of Civil Aviation and the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for the setting up of a joint airline to be operated by Qantas Airways Ltd, Trans-Australia Airlines, Ansett Airlines of Australia and Air Niugini. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was offered the full operation but it wanted to involve Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What concerns me is that after that agreement was reached between the Chief Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the Minister for Transport in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and 2 Australian Ministers,  Mr Morrison,  Minister for External Territories, and myself, the Minister for Transport, we now find that the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government is trying to get out of that agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now find that the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government, the Government of a country for which Australia has done a considerable amount and has provided substantial financial assistance along the lines I just read to honourable members, is trying to get not the whole Australian involvement but just the Australian Government involvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was good enough for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to take the money of the Australian people in the form of airports and the navigation facilities that were provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, having got all those things, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> wants to kick TAA and Qantas out of the operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last Thursday he was reluctant to answer my question whether during his meeting with the Premier of Queensland he would take the opportunity to discuss such matters as concern both governments as the seabed boundary between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Aboriginal health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>by leave- I visited Port Moresby from 6 to 8 November to sign the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> /Australia Trade and Commercial Relations Agreement on behalf of the Government of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Sir Maori  Kiki signed on behalf of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Agreement will come into force when notes are exchanged between the Government of Australia and the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> notifying compliance with their respective legal requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trade between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia has always been an important feature of the special relationship which exists between the 2 countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1926 Australia has accorded special duty free entry to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1950s Australia obtained waivers from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to accord extensive duty free treatment to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> primary and processed primary products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time 95 per cent of Australian imports from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> enter free of duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is an important market for Australian exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1975-76 Australian producers exported approximately $170m worth of goods to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This represented 49 per cent of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s total imports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is Australia’s eleventh largest market for all exports and the third largest market for manufactured goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until the Agreement just signed comes into force trade relations between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will continue to be governed by the Memorandum of Understanding relating to interim trade and commercial arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Memorandum, which was signed in December 1973, was intended to cover trade relations between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the period between self-government and independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the trade between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia has traditionally been free of duties and other restrictions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Agreement was drawn up on the basis of the following 3 aims: To continue and extend the duty free and concessional conditions of access for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> exports into Australia; to allow the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government to develop new industries and to protect them from import competition; and to enable the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government to pursue its social and economic objectives through the encouragement of capital inflow consistent with its investment guidelines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was recognised by both countries that Australia, in entering into this Agreement, should retain the right to protect its industries where it is considered that they are threatened with serious injury by imports from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly the Agreement provides that a free trade area is established consisting of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia and that subject to certain exceptions specified in the Agreement trade between the member states should be free of duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The memorandum was signed during the lifetime of the Labor Government and indicated its initiatives and wish for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to be put on a true economic footing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be difficulties about the economic relationship between our own country and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be difficulties in that country in its dealings with other Third World countries and other developed countries, in the building of its industries, in their protection, and perhaps in some of the concessions which are granted to the industries which will be built up in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and will produce the same lines of goods as those produced in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously we will see the same sorts of problems resulting from the agreement with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be hoped that Australia can successfully monitor the build-up of industries in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the impact they have on industries in Australia so that the period during which those industries are built up will be smooth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, it is in the interests of all political parties in this country for us to encourage the build-up of industries and skills and the diversification of industry in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-24-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All cement used in Darwin is imported from overseasfrom such places as Korea and Taiwan, and approximately 90 per cent of timber is imported from Malaysia and/or <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> with the balance mainly from Western Australia and minor quantities from Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-46-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Customs Act 1901 to give effect to revised rules of origin, made under the Agreement on Trade and Commercial Relations between the Government of Australia and the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and to omit the word ‘sativa’ from the definition of cannibas plant in the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, the request by the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government to purchase the Qantas and TAA shareholding in Air Niugini adds to the doubt that surrounds future plans of Qantas by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and seek leave to incorporate in  Hansard  the whole of that agreement from the 1973 annual report of the Department of Civil Aviation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, all resources contained within the protected zone, outside Australian territory and the Australian territorial seas generated by that territory, should be shared equally between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lastly, outside the eastern and western boundaries of the protected zone <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should be allotted the seabed north to the mainland median line and Australia the seabed south of that line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the real problem is the sharing of any other resources which may be found within the area an equal sharing of such resources between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would seem to be a very sensible and practical compromise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An internationally recognised commission comprising representatives of Australia, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, Queensland and the Islanders formed to administer the sharing of resources would overcome many of the difficulties or frictions which are likely to arise if the Torres Strait Islands and the seas around them are divided by a sea bed line or by any other sort of line <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has emphasised that the continued wellbeing of the Islanders is linked to the conclusion of a satisfactory settlement with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> over this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that whilst we agree, particularly in the case of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, with giving the Minister discretion to waive the one-half rule, it is perhaps appropriate on occasions when that power is used for the Parliament to be notified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have no objection at all to encouraging this discretion to be used in order to see that the economic independence of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> may be assisted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These 3 Bills are consequential to the signing of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Trade and Commercial Relations Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Agreement provides a basis for economic co-operation in the interests of both <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fortunately the resources of Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are generally complementary and provide a mutually satisfactory and non-competitive basis for trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The list of exemptions on the schedules to the Agreement under the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1976 is longer than would be in the interests of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some goods which might be traded in the future are excluded from the Agreement reducing the potential value of the Agreement to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is also contrary to the long-term interests of Australia because self-reliant development in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and reduction of its dependence on Australian aid depends on expansion of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> s overseas markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government could have been considerably more generous in the negotiation of this Agreement in view of the high trade imbalance between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such good sense would have encouraged economic development in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the long run without substantially affecting the interests of Australian industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been some criticisms of the Agreement in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular it ensures access to Australian markets for goods produced in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Agreement is not designed to provide better access to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for Australian goods than for those of any other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has a unique responsibility to encourage development in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential that the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> people be entirely free to choose their own development but this does not relieve Australia of the responsibility to be a facilitating agent in that process to the extent desired by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agreement between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is the essence of these 3 Bills and I merely wanted to devote myself to that aspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that trade with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, given the unique relationship to which the honourable member for Adelaide rightly referred in his speech, would have been of such a nature as to prevent the honourable member from trying to score a mere debating point by saying that the agreement could have been more generous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any trade agreement can be more generous for either participant but the fact is that under this trade agreement total duty free entry is accorded to products of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> coming into Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, Australia’s position with regard to entry of our goods into <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is limited to most favoured nation treatment; in other words, we are at no advantage over any other third nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think we can rely upon the Government of Indonesia, nor do I think we need to be unduly afraid of Indonesia, but we do have to ask ourselves what we would do if Indonesia’s next step were to do something about <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us presume that Indonesia considered the situation in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to be so unstable that it was a threat to them, and from what Indonesia has said about Timor I can imagine it doing that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went to Queensland, after serving as Police Commissioner in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, to serve the Queensland Police Force, the Queensland people and the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mineral exploration expenditure in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is another subject dealt with by the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have since agreed, as had the previous Government, to a request by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that the life of the transitional provisions be extended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extension will permit deductions for exploration expenditure incurred up to 30 June 1978 in pursuance of exploration rights held at the time of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> ‘s independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are transferring the ownership of this land to the Aboriginal people in the same sense as we transferred the ownership of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> at independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They also relate to employment in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Persons concerned will have certain rights if in the future they have to join or do join the Public Service or statutory bodies after leaving <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The long service leave Bills contain provisions to ensure that persons in public employment in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> prior to Independence who worked for the independent state of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> after Independence and who then entered or who in the future may enter Commonwealth employment will get entitlements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously this is a most important provision as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> moves to nationhood and replaces Australian nationals with its own trained staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It concerns the state of negotiations last weekend between Australia and the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government over the Australian border. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government accept the proposal for a seabed line through a protected zone? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be grossly unfair on my part to give an indication of the view of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on this specific question when it has asked at this stage to examine the matter further and to look into the implications of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is fair to say that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been extremely co-operative in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Indonesian archipelago, together with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, would be an important factor in any offensive military strategy against Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Dr Teichmann also expressed the view that the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was likely to dissolve into a series of secessionist movements, and the same could well occur with Indonesia during the next 10 years or so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In May of this year the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence decided to investigate the boundary between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A sub-committee was appointed to carry out this investigation which to some degree was restricted as the question was already the subject of negotiations between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has plans to establish two medium frequency (AM) broadcasting stations at Lae, each with a power of 100 000 watts, but no dates for the commissioning of these stations have yet been set, so far as Australia is aware. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-94-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave- The Australian and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> governments have agreed that the arrangements under which the Construction Agency of the Australian Department of Construction has been operating in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should be terminated and the Agency withdrawn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 2 governments have decided on this course of action because of the increased capacity of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> works authorities and the somewhat reduced size of the current <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> works program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Construction Agency, which replaced the Department of Construction’s regional organisation at the end of 1975, originally had a staff of approximately 200 comprising expatriate Australians and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> nationals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Satisfactory arrangements have also been made for the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> nationals to be employed with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Public Service, or in the private sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The staff of the Agency deserve tribute for the work they have done in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have been involved in many aspects of infrastructure development in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> including the provision of transport facilities, water supplies, communication networks and power stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many projects such as the Nadzab airport development, the Ramu hydroelectric scheme and the Bank of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> building come to mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The facilities of the Department of Construction will continue to be available on request to the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on terms which may be agreed between the 2 Governments from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable members I present the following documents relating to defence arrangements between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>: A joint statement by the Australian Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>; a status of forces agreement which will be registered with the United Nations; and two separate exchanges of letters between the Australian Minister for Defence and the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Minister for Defence, Foreign Relations and Trade, concerning: Consultations regarding the use of Australian loan personnel in politically sensitive situations; and an arrangement for the supply support of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Department of Defence by the Department of Defence, Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will note that they closely follow the arrangements in force during the interim period since <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> independence, as set out in documents tabled by my predecessor in the previous Government on 9 October 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They demonstrate, in a practical way, the importance Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> attach to a continuing and close relationship in the defence field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agreement between the Australian and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> governments to sustain their close co-operation in defence matters and the joint affirmation of their intention to consult at the request of either about matters affecting their common security is not the less historic because so readily agreed, nor the less significant- for each and for others- because their friendship is already so firmly and so openly established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Parliament may look with pleasure and with no little pride upon the fact that in this new era of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s independence and national sovereignty it has joined with Australia to re-affirm a clear and mutual interest in close co-operation and consultation in defence matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government continues to seek by direct negotiation between the two countries continuing support and co-operation in defence matters with Australia, not by any formal defence treaty but by mutually acceptable arrangements between the two Governments and by frequent consultations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will note that, under the arrangements, Australia will continue to assist in the development of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Defence Force through the Defence Cooperation Program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This program, to which the Government has allocated some $ 1 2m this financial year, will be planned in close consultation with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government and will be responsive to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I commend the Australia-<span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> defence arrangements to the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because there is a copper mine on Bougainville the residents there believe that they ought to secede from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The exception is <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, which was an Australian colony, an Australian mandate and later trust territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was under Australian auspices that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was brought to independence and nationhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I turn very briefly to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much has been said already about our relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is imperative that our present close relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> be expanded and developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The southern coast of Papua is only about 5 kilometres from the northern part of my electorate; so all the people in the electorate of Leichhardt, including myself, are very much aware of the significance of our relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several times recently I have been questioned on why we give so much aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that as the former colonial power we have a great responsibility to help the splendid efforts of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government in developing the country and improving the sometimes very low standard of living of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most difficult problems with which I am faced is the definition of the boundary between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the Torres Strait. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, as then, I welcome the agreement which has been reached between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that a protected zone should be established in the area confirming the traditional rights of the Torres Strait Islanders and the coastal Papuans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Torres Strait Island leaders are agreed that the resources of the Torres Strait in the protected zone outside the Australian islands and the territorial waters should be shared equally between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support what was said by my colleague, the honourable member for Leichhardt  (Mr Thomson),  about <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told then, as we were told about the independence of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, that with the removal of the Australian and other armed men from the area bloodshed and wholehearted slaughter would take place between the people who lived in those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told that we could not take any steps towards giving <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> its independence; that we must keep it as one of our colonies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many Australians are afraid that if the aggression against Timor goes unchallenged that the Indonesian Government which has already absorbed West New Guinea-now West Irian- will make demands upon the newly independent nation of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, superannuation payments and payments for loss of salary to retrenched Australian public servants from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> are included in the Government’s aid classification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is inconsistent with the Government’s agreement with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government to exclude these termination payments and retirement benefits from aid to that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has had this type of health service for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Lang made a good point when he said that we should exclude from our figures for overseas aid subscriptions which we make to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is almost morally part of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason we have a moral responsibility to assist <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, our assistance to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> should be something quite separate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The Malaysian representative had something similar to say, as did the representative from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of example- these examples have been given before but are worth repeating- Australia has undertaken to provide <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> with at least $180m per annum over the next 5 years, largely in the form of budget support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the remaining 50 per cent represented Australian Budget aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1975-76 it was $148m, a significant proportion of which would have been expended by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the purchase of goods and services from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ultimate effect of the sentiment expressed by the Opposition would be that all Australian relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> could be endangered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I understand it, for example, were the Australian armed forces to second, say, computer operators, people skilled in that technical kind of work, between this country ‘s armed forces and say the armed forces of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> it could be done under this clause, but were the clause to be deleted another whole set of formal procedures would have to be followed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For various reasons, no doubt now lost in the various files of the Public Service Board and other places, it was decided to add to the original organisation virtually the entire staff of the then Department of External Territories because nobody knew what to do with them as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> approached independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless among our special achievements since taking office no doubt pride of place must be given to the major increases in our bilateral aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the South Pacific in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first case our commitment to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> guarantees to that nation that we will spend over a 5-year period commencing in 1976-77 at least $930m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision to set up the aid agency was warmly welcomed by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, for example, yet despite the great emphasis Australia places on relations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> the agency was abolished without any consultation to ascertain whether our chief aid recipient would be seriously disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He pointed to the type of aid Australia had given to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, which has not increased that country’s debt burden, as being closest to the ideal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The significance of the area becomes clear when it is realised that New Zealand is our fourth largest market, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> our fifth largest market and the Pacific Islands the twelfth largest market for Australian exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He criticised the then Government because aid principles were not stated in the tabling of the Bill by the then Foreign Minister,  Mr E.  G. Whitlam, knowing full well that an advisory board was to be set up and that the staff of the Agency would nearly all come from the Department of External Territories and that in the early days the Agency would be overwhelmingly concerned with the phasing out of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has always been a selfish motive in Australian aid policies but now that the Philistines have taken over in the Liberal Party our aid policy will be totally self-directed with perhaps the exception of our aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, which should be regarded as a special case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is not sensible the aid agency must be clear and show the large portion of its budget that goes to student supervision and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the minor part that goes to the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But those who indulged in what I refer to as cant and hypocrisy and wearing flowers and hearts on their sleeves today proclaiming the importance of aid programs would do well to recall that under the aegis of a special relationship with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, it was Labor that slashed aid programs to that country, and not just in any year but in the very year in which independence was to be reached by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>- the most sensitive period of her development towards nationhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of just increasing aid for one year we gave a 5-year rolling program of such magnitude that the Finance Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> went to international forums and said that Australia’s program of aid and development assistance to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was a model for all other countries to follow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Other additional provisions include: $2m for payment of termination benefits to former employers of the Australian Staffing Assistance Group in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and pension payments to former employees of previous administrations in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>; $6.6.m for the Australian Broadcasting Commission; $3m for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation; $5.5. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The facts are as follows: In September 1975 I left Australia to visit <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and then went onwards to attend a conference in Iran. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This subcommittee has completed its initial report, which dealt with the territorial boundary between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the Torres Strait area, and this was presented to Parliament on 9 December 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>IDA has also lent relatively large amounts to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and that country is expected to receive further credits in future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have specific arrangements with New Zealand and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and I think that all Australians would see those arrangements as being proper arrangements with 2 very close neighbours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As if that were not enough, only today I have had a report that in the rice industry there is a dispute between the Federated Storemen and Packers Union and the Federated Millers and Mill Employees Association, as a result of which it seems that 1 100 tons of bagged rice destined for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and a cargo of 20 000 tons due to be loaded at Portland will not be loaded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge in this respect the important influence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in encouraging the Papuans and New Guineans and the Australian Government, which was the colonial administrator of the then Territory, to change the emphasis from an almost exclusive preoccupation with capital intensive development to one which tended to develop towards equal emphasis for labour intensive activity within the economy aimed at mobilising more traditional forms of economic activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, figures provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that in 1973-76 3.1 per cent of the total quantity of coffee imported into Australia came from Brazil and 37.2 per cent came from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-9">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because they are our near neighbours- they are not our nearest neighbours; <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is that- we should do our level best to understand those characteristics and to shape our relations with them accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770824_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It created a powerful impetus which influenced Singapore and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> also to ignore Indonesian aggression in that small country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs: Did a delegation of the most senior <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> departmental heads visit Canberra recently for discussions about Australian aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> delegation leave angry and frustrated by this snub? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, I ask whether the Minister intends to make a statement to the House about a recent incident where a Joint Intelligence Organisation agent approached an Australian academic in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to spy against that country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will that officer be withdrawn from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister investigate and take action on these incidents which have caused a further rupture in relations between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Now, on a question concerning <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, he tries to imply that the relationship has been ruptured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the action of his Party when in government in 1975 which led to the most disjointed and disappointed series of talks on the side of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on aid questions shortly prior to or shortly after the date for independence when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> was seeking to determine its budgetary allocation for the period immediately after independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Talks at Kirribilli in 1975 stay in the minds of officials and Ministers of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to this day and will do so for a long time hence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We worked out a five-year agreement with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and that agreement has been hailed by  Mr Julius  Chan and others-  Mr Chan,  I remind the House, is the Acting Prime Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> at the moment -as an example for other donor countries to follow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agreement was reached in an atmosphere of appreciation of the way in which Australia was responding to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s requests and not imposing its own views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government, appreciative of the certainty that is inbuilt into the agreement on aid, was nevertheless proposing a further form of agreement that could be utilised over the remaining three-year period of that agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a further update of an agreement which, as I say, was hailed by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In regard to the final aspect of the question asked by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, I discussed this matter last night with the Acting Prime Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>,  Mr Chan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will anyone in this chamber say that if trouble erupts on the border between West Irian and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that we should stand by in silence and do nothing as in fact, to our eternal shame, has been our attitude with respect to East Timor? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from the obvious comment as to why there should be any distinction between East Timorese and the Papua New Guineans, I feel entitled to ask: What guarantee can Australia offer, on its past track record, to our colleagues in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that their situation would be handled in a different way if an act of attempted incorporation occurs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, if a country near Australia- it may be New Zealand or <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>- wanted to obtain a senior defence scientist, a computer operator for its defence force or some specialist, but not a person who will engage in warlike activities, why cannot that country place an advertisement in an Australian newspaper? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The latest moves by the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> with which the Australian Government seems to concur, places the security of the people of the Torres Strait, particularly of” the islands of Dauan, Boigu and Saibai, in peril. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is he aware of the existence of official maps of which I have copies here, one published in 1974 by the Division of National Mapping, another one published by the Division of National Mapping in 1949 and one issued by the Surveyor’s Office in Brisbane in 1892, which show clearly that the Australian border lies between those islands and the mainland of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After our examination of the original documents, I can state that the reality today is that in approaching the Torres Strait negotiations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, as part of our negotiations from the Arafura Sea to the Coral Sea, I set to proceed from a proper basis at law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The law clearly stated that these islands belonged to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> from the original decree in the latter part of the last century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it means that at law, in the attitude of the Queensland Government, in the attitude of the Torres Strait Islanders and in the attitude and decisions of the Federal Government and of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the islands belong to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been a tendency on the part of this Governmentthere was also a sign of it under the Labor Government- to think that some of the islands in the Torres Strait should well be transferred to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Has his attention been drawn to the report in the  Canberra Times  of 8 March 1978 by Frank Cranston where he stated that a proper sharing of the Torres Strait waters between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> leave within the Port Moresby administration the Queensland islands which lie to the south of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> coast, that a regime is being sought with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which will ensure protection for the traditional fishing rights of the people on the disputed islands without circumscribing the generality of Port Moresby’s prerogatives down to an agreed median line and that although the Governments have agreed in principle over the issue, the drafting of the legislation giving force to it is expected to prove difficult; if so, is there any substance in the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-45-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he having discussions with his counterpart in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> concerning a 200-mile fishing and economic zone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-45-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the substance of the report, I invite the honourable member’s attention to the joint statement which the then <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Foreign Minister,  Sir Maori  Kiki, and I issued on S June 1976 concerning agreement on a number of points basic to a Torres Strait settlement in which it was stated,  inter alia,  that: ‘<span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, in view of the wishes of the Torres Strait Islanders which  Mr Peacock  had stressed, has accepted that Australia will retain all Australian inhabited islands.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-45-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore incorrect to suggest that a delimitation of territorial seas or of 200-mile zones between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would leave those islands under <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> sovereignty or administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-45-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was also stated in the joint statement of S June 1976 that: ‘a zone will be established in the Torres Strait to protect and preserve the traditional way of life and livelihood of the Torres Strait Islanders and the residents of the adjacent coast of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, including fishing and freedom of movement, both north and south of the seabed boundary.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-45-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore correct that the Austraiian Government has sought a regime which will ensure protection for the traditional fishing rights of the local inhabitants of the Torres Strait, and has obtained the provisional agreement of the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to the establishment of a Protected Zone for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-45-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government’s position in further negotiations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will be to reach an equitable and permanent settlement which will embody these points of provisional agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-45-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been agreed that the Australian territorial sea around the islands of Boigu, Dauan and Saibai, which will lie to the north of the seabed boundary, will be three miles, and that there will be a line delimiting the territorial sea between these islands and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-45-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The joint communique issued by the Prime Ministers of Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>,  Mr Fraser  and  Mr Somare,  on 11 February 1977 stated that: ‘provisional agreement had been reached on the location of a seabed boundary running some 1200 miles from the Arafura Sea, through the Torres Strait and out through the Coral Sea.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-45-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>and (4) I invite the honourable member’s attention to the joint statement of 10 February 1978, and to the statement which I issued on 31 March 1978, concerning interim proclamations of extended maritime jurisdiction in the area between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-45-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the intention of the Australian and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Governments that final and permanent arrangements in respect of the delimitation of territorial seas and 200-mile zones will be decided upon in the course of the resumed negotiations to reach an equitable and permanent settlement on maritime boundaries between their two countries and on all other issues relating to Torres Strait. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-45-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave- I wish to inform honourable members that, in my discussions in Port Moresby last week with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade,  Mr Olewale,  we agreed upon the principal basic elements which are to be included in the treaty to be concluded on maritime boundaries between our two countries and on other matters relating to the Torres Strait. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that honourable members understand that because the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Parliament is at present in recess, I have agreed with  Mr Olewale  that we shall each present to our respective parliaments in two weeks time a fuller outline of the principal basic elements to be included in the treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will know that Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> have been engaged in these negotiations over a period of years, beginning before <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> moved to independence in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There could be no such lines until <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> became independent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> governments have approached the negotiations with great care and concern in order to arrive at a solution which is equitable in human terms and lasting and beneficial in its consequences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a statement on 31 March 1978 I said that research had shown that the small uninhabited islands of Kawa, Mata Kawa and Kussa, which lie very close to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> mainland but which have often been shown on maps as part of Queensland, were not among the Torres Strait islands annexed to Queensland in the last century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I added that the Australian Government had accordingly informed the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> that, in the eventual treaty, Australia would recognise them as part of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the Second World War that Territory was administered in union with the Territory of New Guinea and, as the third schedule to the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Act 1949, as amended up to the time of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s independence, makes clear, islands within the Torres Strait that were not part of the State of Queensland continued to be within the bounds of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> immediately prior to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will be clear from what I have said about the status of the Kawa and Kussa Islands that no question arises about any transfer of Australian territory to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From a constitutional point of view and assuming that the Government’s views about the historical position are proved to be correct in the legal sense, I make the following comments: The treaty to be agreed to by the governments of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia does not involve any transfer of land territory and does not involve the transfer of any territory from Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An important point to note is contained in a report which has been tabled, concerning the boundaries between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and in which my colleague the honourable member for Hawker  (Mr Jacobi)  has expressed a view with which I find myself in complete agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Currently the Government is negotiating with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> concerning the Torres Strait border and economic zones and fishing zones wil be a part of those negotiations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I look forward to the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  on the current state of negotiations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> on the Torres Strait border, which I think is due to be presented within a fortnight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall be very interested to see the outcome of negotiations with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> concerning the Torres Strait area because I believe that Australia clearly has the right to claim a 12 mile territorial sea around its islands, both inhabited and uninhabited, in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Has the Government ‘s attention been drawn to the public comments of an Indonesian diplomat in Port Moresby that if Indonesia wanted to invade <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> it would do it now when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is still weak and that it would not wait until later when <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> becomes strong; if so, what is the Australian Government’s attitude to this statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-11-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Government, on the information in its possession, assure the people of Australia that they are not likely to see in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> a repeat performance of what is known to have happened in East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-11-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Indonesian Government has stated as firm policy its support for the independence and sovereignty of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-11-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the islands around to our east, and New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- In my statement to Parliament on 1 1 May 1978 I informed honourable members that, in recent negotiations with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade,  Mr Ebia  Olewale, we agreed upon the principal basic elements which are to be included in the treaty to be concluded on maritime boundaries between our two countries and on other matters relating to Torres Strait. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this statement I wish to present to honourable members an account of the principal basic elements which the Australian and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Foreign Ministers have agreed will be included in the treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Foreign Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is presenting a similar account to his Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before proceeding to speak about the treaty elements, I wish to recall that Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> have been engaged in these negotiations over a period of years, beginning before <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> moved to independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the package of elements which is now emerging provides for a fair and equitable division of sea and seabed resources between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia across the whole area traversed by the proposed lines of delimitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourthly, arrangements will be established in the Torres Strait area which are designed to meet fully the particular needs of the people of the area, including the people of the adjacent coastal area of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, with regard to traditional movements and traditional fishing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the treaty, Australia will recognise <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> sovereignty over the islands of Kawa, Mata Kawa and Kussa; <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will recognise Australian sovereignty over all the Australian islands in the Torres Strait shown on map 1 1 as lying north of the seabed line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As shown on the maps, the territorial seas of the Australian islands north of the seabed line, and of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the area between Boigu and Dauan will be a maximum of three nautical miles, and a territorial sea boundary will be delimited between Boigu, Dauan and Saibai and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The licensing arrangements will have regard to the desirability of promoting economic development and employment opportunities in the Torres Strait area including the adjacent coastal area of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the people of the area will be consulted about these arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subject to the phasing arrangements specified in the paper I have tabled, the sharing of the commercial protected zone fisheries will be on the basis that Australia will have an overall share of 25 per cent of the commercial fisheries in waters under <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> jurisdiction; <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will have an overall share of 25 per cent of the commercial fisheries in waters under Australian jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The share in the territorial seas of the Australian uninhabited islands north of the seabed line other than Turnagain, however, will be on a 50/50 basis and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will have 100 per cent of the commercial barramundi fishery near the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> coast, excluding the territorial seas of Saibai, Dauan and Boigu. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Third State operators will not normally be licensed to exploit those fisheries unless agreed by Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Outline of principal basic elements agreed upon on 5 May 1978 between the Foreign Ministers of Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to be included in the treaty to be concluded on maritime boundaries between their two countries and on other matters relating to Torres Strait. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia will recognise <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> sovereignty over the islands of Kawa, Mata Kawa and Kussa and the smaller islands appurtenant to those islands and over their territorial seas, subject to delimitation as necessary to be specified in the treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will recognise Australian sovereignty over the inhabited islands of Boigu, Dauan and Saibai and the smaller islands appurtenant to these, islands, including Aubusi, Moimi and Kaumag and over the nine Australian uninhabited islands lying north of the seabed delimitation line, that is Turu Cay, Kerr Islet, Deliverance Island, Turnagain Island, Pearce Cay, Black <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The territorial seas of Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> between Boigu and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and between Dauan and Saibai and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, will be delimited along two agreed lines as broadly indicated on the maps. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The breadth of the territorial sea of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> along its southern coastline between the meridians 142 03’ 30” East and 1 42  5 1 ‘ 00 “ East will be a maximum of three miles and will not extend south of the two territorial sea delimitation lines or the straight line linking them as indicated on the maps. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extent of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> territorial sea, which will not in any event extend into the area south of the agreed seabed line, agreed areas of Australian territorial sea to the north of the seabed line, or the agreed area of Australian fisheries jurisdiction north of the seabed line, will depend on the base lines or archipelagic lines adopted by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in accordance with international law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will not in future extend their territorial seas across the seabed delimitation line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The treaty will provide for equitable arrangements to be made by <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in respect of the holders of the Australian petroleum permit Q/10P in those parts of the permit area that will fall on the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> side of the seabed delimitation line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the administrative process of issuing licences, the relevant authorities of the two countries will have regard to the desirability of promoting economic development in the Torres Strait area including the adjacent coastal area of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and employment opportunities for the people of the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provided these levels remain within the optimum sustainable yield of the fishery concerned, they will not be reduced for five years from the date of entry into force of the treaty but, over the subsequent five years, levels of ‘take’ may be adjusted progressively so that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will have an overall share of 25 per cent of the ‘take’ of the commercial Protected Zone fisheries in waters under Australian jurisdiction and Australia will have an overall share of 25 per cent of the ‘take’ of the commercial Protected Zone fisheries in waters under <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> jurisdiction, subject to the following: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the territorial seas of the Australian uninhabited islands north of the seabed line, other than Turnagain, the ‘sharing-of-take’ formula will be 50 per cent Australia/50 per cent <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will have 100 per cent of the take’ in the commercial barramundi fishery near the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> coast, excluding the territorial seas of Saibai, Dauan and Boigu, and this ‘take’ will not be included in calculating the overall percentage share of ‘take’ in the commercial Protected Zone fisheries under the agreed ‘sharing-of-take’ formula mentioned above. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>- Negotiations on Maritime Boundaries and on other Matters Relating to Torres Strait-Ministerial Statement, 25 May 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  had delivered a statement relating to negotiations on maritime boundaries between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, particularly as they apply to the Torres Strait. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note that in this latest statement the Minister obtained leave to incorporate in  Hansard  the elements of the basic agreements which were reached on 5 May between the Foreign Ministers of Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to say that we find <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> a most welcome neighbour indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a former colonial responsibility <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has now developed into a strong, resilient political group very well disposed towards us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We note that the maps produced deal with a number of areas, namely, the seabed resources delimitation line; the swimming fisheries resources delimitation line; the protected zone; the limit of the Australian territorial sea north of the seabed line; territorial sea delimitation lines between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Boigu, Dauan and Saibai; and the basic extent of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> territorial sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also await the reaction of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Parliament to this report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It sets out how those commercial fisheries shall be shared by both <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the Australian nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said- I think it is rightthat the Torres Strait Islanders have always enjoyed access to the three islands, the sovereignty of which has been predicted as suitable to be recognised as belonging to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia should acknowledge that the existing border is a legitimate grievance to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and that a delineation of the seabed boundary south of the existing boundary is a realignment that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> can reasonably expect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The resolution of such a question should not be allowed to be impeded by purely domestic constitutional difficulties in Australia, which have nothing to do with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and which <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> can legitimately claim should not adversely affect her interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government should make every effort to ensure that the inhabitants of the Torres Strait Islands are kept fully informed and are consulted in any settlement that is negotiated with the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Australian Constitution the National Government is responsible for the conduct of Australia’s foreign relations including negotiations of any settlement with the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in regard to the boundary separating our two countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As long as Australia exercised external responsibilities for peace, order and good government’ on behalf of the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the border issue was very largely academic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the run up to independence this matter was in fact raised in the Australian Parliament in 1971 and the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Parliament in 1969 and 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very fact that the 1879 line lacks the essential attribute of precision, and that this line lies only a few hundred metres from the coast of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> must necessarily be a source of grievance, if not even offence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That this is so was acknowledged long before <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> became independent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At independence, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> assumed the rights and obligations conferred upon it as a sovereign state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The evidence indicates an intention on the part of the government of Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to reach an acceptable settlement involving a re-alignment of present boundary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The establishment of a protective zone in the Torres Strait to preserve the traditional way of life and livelihood of the islanders and the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, to be administered by a Commission having representation from all parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The failure to concede to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> the rights proposed by the two Governments could well lead to the following consequences: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> may pass its ‘National Seas Bill’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would create overlapping and conflict of claims between the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government as to respective areas of influence and jurisdiction, both national and international. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the desirability of this option could be countervailed if transfer of the islands could guarantee a comprehensive and permanent resolution of differences with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Defence Department made quite clear in its submission to the Sub-Committee that the over-riding defence consideration in Torres Strait was to prevent an unresolved boundaries dispute becoming a source of friction in a general sense between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally it is necessary to discuss the legal and constitutional issues involved in the changes that are proposed regarding Australia ‘s boundary with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia should acknowledge that the existing border is a legitimate grievance to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and that a delineation of the seabed boundary south of the existing boundary is a realignment that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> can reasonably expect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The resolution of such a question should not be allowed to be impeded by purely domestic constitutional difficulties in Australia, which have nothing to do with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and which <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> can legitimately claim should not adversely affect her interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government should make every effort to ensure that the inhabitants of the Torres Strait Islands are kept fully informed and are consulted in any settlement that is negotiated with the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Australian Constitution the National Government is responsible for the conduct of Australia’s foreign relations including negotiations of any settlement with the Government of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in regard to the boundary separating our two countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The failure to concede to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> the rights proposed by the two Governments could well lead to the following consequences: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> may pass its ‘National Seas Bill’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would create overlapping and conflict of claims between the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Government as to respective areas of influence and jurisdiction, both national and international. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Equally, one assumes, reference to the map, that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has exercised its right with the exception of the area encompassing the fishery resources delimitation zone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those initiatives led to the independence of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and the laying of the foundation for this agreement which I trust will be a lasting and very sound agreement between both countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is fishing within that 3-mile territory limit on a commercial basis subject to the ratio of 75 per cent for Australia and 25 per cent for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fear was expressed that a sea-bed line would cause the three nothern islands of Saibai, Dauan, and Boigu to be in an enclave in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without detracting from what the Labor Government did so far as <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is concerned, I point out that the first interdepartmental committee which was established on this question was set up in 1972 when I was Minister for External Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, it is proposed by the Bill to give servicemen of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and certain civilians accompanying them, limited sales tax concessions for importation of personal effects, furniture, household goods and motor vehicles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The concessions, which are a little more liberal than those available to ordinary passengers arriving in Australia, are required in fulfilment of Australia’s obligations under the Status of Forces Agreement between the governments of Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I rise to join with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Defence Minister,  Mr Mona,  in denouncing the disgraceful actions of the honourable member for Lalor  (Mr Barry Jones)  in recent times in mounting a campaign for publicity purposes which has failed to elicit any new information and which has cast a slur on the Australian Armed Forces, a slur on historians in this country and a slur on the archivists of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1976,  Sir Albert  Maori Kiki, then  Deputy  Prime Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, wrote to the then Minister for Veterans’ Affairs seeking a special pension similar to the Australian service pension to be paid to bona fide <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> ex-servicemen from the age of SS years until death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because the honourable member for Lalor has come under fire for raising the matter, I thought it would be useful if I reminded the House of the actual atmosphere of the time, of the dreadful atrocities of which the Japanese had been guilty and of the crimes that in fact were committed by the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, many of whom were arrested and tried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My reading of that Act is that it is probable that at that stage the people involved presumed that the people of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> were subject to the Defence Act and subject to military authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fourth provision of the Bill is designed to give servicemen from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> limited sales tax concessions for importation of such items as personal effects, furniture, household goods and cars, and is required under the Status of Forces Agreement between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Stated succinctly, Australia’s attitude obviously is to have a positive and understandable interest in the maintenance and development of good relations between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780816_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Indonesian response has been to stress the good relations it has with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as well as the importance it attaches to them, and Prime Minister Somare has indicated that <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> will continue to maintain a dialogue with the Indonesian authorities over the border. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780816_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to speculation and reports on the matter, it is of interest to note that  Mr Somare  when addressing the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Parliament on 14 August about the border situation emphasised ‘that far too much is being made of the whole issue’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780816_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Quoting Prime Minister Somare again, because this is a matter related to his own country, he also said in the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Parliament on 14 August: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780816_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The specified categories are children under the age of 1 8 years; crew members; accredited diplomats; persons who arrive in Australia but are deemed under the Migration Act 1958 not to have entered Australia, that is, persons who remain at the airport and persons who do not disembark from a ship; persons covered by the Status of Forces Agreements with the United States and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>; and persons being deported or extradited from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I read the projected agreement, a fair amount of sea space will be surrendered to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for commercial fishing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are sea people and have over the years lived at a subsistence level based on the sea; but if they are ever to have anything at all going for them in a commercial sense all of the fisheries of the Torres Strait area must be preserved for them- not for the Australian fishing industry or the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> fishing industry but for them alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in view of the seriousness of the situation for Australia’s exports to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, I have instructed officials of my Department to confer with officials of the Australian sugar industry to prepare formal notification to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade challenging the EEC on its behaviour in respect of Article 16 of the GATT to see whether we cannot take some positive action to stop this dumping. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In answer to a question yesterday concerning the dumping of sugar in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by the European Economic Community, he indicated that his Department would be consulting the industry on what measures Australia will be taking against the EEC under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I mentioned to the House yesterday how incensed the Australian sugar industry and I are that it is now dumping sugar on the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> market with a subsidy content equivalent to about three times the world price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be of interest to honourable members to note that the region did not include the reefs north of Cape York because of the continuing discussion over the international border between <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fifty-one per cent, or over half, of our aid next year will go the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognise that we have a major responsibility to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, a responsibility which we must continue to bear, although I think that the very fact of that responsibility which countries such as Canada, Sweden and Norway do not have may be a further argument that the proportion of our resources that we devote to overseas aid should be perhaps greater than that of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the problems of the bias towards <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> in our aid- the fact that over half of it goes to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>- is that it also runs contrary to one of the basic principles of the Development Decade, and that is the urgings of nearly every international body that the advanced societies should give first priority to the least developed of countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, I think it would clearly benefit Australia- and also <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>- if Australia could play a more active international role in diversifying <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>’s sources of aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A diversification of sources of aid for <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> would enable Australia to pursue a more diversified and imaginative aid program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been put on notice tonight by the honourable member for Bonython  (Dr Blewett)  who indicated quite clearly that the quantum of aid to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, quite apart from its nature, ought to be re-examined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was another element of the Hayden Budget which created grave uncertainty at the most sensitive period of time and which almost tore asunder that close trusting relationship which had been developed with <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> by successive LiberalNational Country Party governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The year in which it was entering into independence was hardly the year in which to commence the slashing of aid programs to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our aid program to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> has been described by the  Deputy  Prime Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> as being not merely the most enlightened in the world but as an example to all other developed countries to follow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and New Zealand over the past five years or so Australia’s exports have accounted respectively for 50 per cent and 20 per cent of the value of imports into the two markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While the provisions of the Migration Act 1958 apply to Papua New Guineans entering Australia, as they do to other overseas nationals, over a long period there has been unrestricted movement of Papua New Guineans and Torres Strait Islanders between some of the islands in the Torres Strait and the adjacent coastal areas of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Papua New Guineans and Torres Strait Islanders moving in that limited area for such traditional purposes have not always held passports or visas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-11">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In a statement to the House of Representatives on 25 May 1978 the Minister for Foreign Affairs described the principal basic elements which the Australian and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Foreign Ministers have agreed will be included in the treaty to be concluded on maritime boundaries between the two countries and on other matters relating to Torres Strait. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-11">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Within this zone the Torres Strait Islanders and the Papua New Guineans who live in the adjacent coastal area will be able to continue their traditional activities and to move about freely for these purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In establishing the Agency, the Government will be in a position to learn from the experience gained by the operations of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Minister for Foreign Affairs will recollect that on 2 November he and the Foreign Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> initialled an agreement covering the sea bed border between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But by having the agreement of all the Islanders, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and ourselves that there be a protected zone which within it guarantees the sovereignty of Australian islands, that all Islanders remain Australian, that the Islands generate a territorial sea, that the customs and traditions of the peoples of the region are guaranteed and enshrined in a treaty, I can justifiably say that the settlement is unique. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave- Honourable members will be aware that at my meeting with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade,  Mr Ebia  Olewale, in Daru on 2 November, we adopted, and agreed to submit to our respective governments, the text of the treaty that is to be concluded on maritime boundaries between our two countries and on other matters relating to the Torres Strait. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I also inform honourable members that both Governments have agreed that the treaty will be signed in mid December at <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> House in Sydney by the Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers of Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It incorporates in formal treaty language, and with the necessary degree of precision, the principal basic elements which I had agreed with the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Foreign Minister would be included in the Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are delighted to say that that is also recognised by our very good friend and neighbour, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Further, I congratulate the Foreign Minister and now  Deputy  Prime Minister of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, the honourable Ebia Olewale, with whom I share an electoral boundary in this area for his foresight, patience and dedication to the national interests of his country in the reaching of this agreement; it could not have been easy for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Subject to that priority, the Treaty settles the delimitation between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> fishing zones in the Torres Strait area; within the Protected Zone, it provides for the equitable sharing between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> of the catch of commercial fisheries, as outlined in my statement to Parliament on 25 May this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-58-162">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where does that sort of double standard leave Australian credibility with other countries such as, for example, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> which is perhaps as much affected by Australian policy as Australia is affected by American policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Treaty will probably not become fully effective until late in 1979 or 1980, since ratification cannot take place until legislation has been enacted by Australia, <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> and Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the Treaty’s provisions, including arrangements for the sharing of the area’s natural resources, will be the subject of continuing negotiations and co-operation between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee feels, however, that the more important matters covered by the Treaty are: Firstly, retention of Australian sovereignty over all the islands with the exception of Kawa, Mata Kawa and Kussathree uninhabited islands lying close to the coast of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the delimitation of the seabed resources between Australia and <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fifthly, the confirmation of fishing rights in territorial waters for local inhabitants of the islands of Aubusi, Boigu, Dauan, Kaumag, Moimi and Saibai which have been retained by Australia under the Treaty, and, sixthly, the guarantee of freedom of movement by Papua New Guineans and Torres Strait Islanders within the protected zone to engage in their traditional activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One hopes this includes the rights of Australians to visit the mainland of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> for traditional purposes to gather water from wells. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are exotic animal and plant diseases and illegal immigration from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem of animal and plant diseases passing to Australia through the Torres Strait from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> is at present only potential, but in view of the prevalence of certain very serious animal pests in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, such as the screw-worm fly, the Committee recommends that quarantine procedures in the area should be considerably strengthened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Illegal immigration from <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to the Torres Strait Islands and eventually to mainland Australia is a well-known practice, and one which poses a major risk of disease entering Australia through animals brought into Australian territory by Papua New Guineans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the Committee heard evidence from the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs on this question last August, the Department has taken measures to identify Papua New Guineans living illegally in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result, almost 200 returned voluntarily to <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, and 5 were deported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I see it, if the terms of this Treaty are to the advantage of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> then they cannot be to the advantage of the Torres Strait <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Except in the case of <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span>, to which it shall refer separately, the Government has decided that, pending conclusion of delimitation negotiations with these countries, median lines in accord with Australia’s maximum legal entitlement should be used for the interim delimitation of the AFZ in areas between Australia and its neighbours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although my Department has no direct responsibility in the matter, officers assisted the three seamen concerned with money from the Merchant Navy Welfare Society, Brisbane and drew the attention of the <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> Consul and the Department of Transport and Civil Aviation in <span class="highlight">Papua New Guinea</span> to the living conditions on board the vessel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-56-22">[More…]</a></p>
