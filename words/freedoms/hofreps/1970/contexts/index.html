<ul>
  <li>
    <p>One concerns the proposition put up by the AttorneyGeneral  (Mr N. H. Bowen)  that no necessity exists to define certain <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> by certain positive statements because he considers that the method that always has been used in this country to be the more liberal way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposition that I wish to put to the Attorney-General is this: In clause 14 of this Bill positive statements are made as far as certain rights, <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and dignities in respect of protected persons are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently protected persons in this country in turn are entitled to certain <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and dignities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly object to the proposition that apparently non-protected persons in this country are not entitled to those <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and dignities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All those honourable members have talked about what is needed in Australia, the Liberal Party philosophy and how it protects individual <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all they cherish their <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did those changes come into effect last February and do they further restrict the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of the Polish people and make the foreign policy of Poland even more subservient to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor has evolved a practical program to ensure our basic civil rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>- to reshape our laws to meet the needs and aspirations of the seventies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and expresses the wish that one day the people of Hungary will have the opportunity to live in their country with the same rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> as those which are enjoyed by the people of the Commonwealth of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to say quite clearly now that I consider the processes of this Parliament, its right to the proper scrutiny of legislation and the duty of its membership to examine every piece of legislation which affects the rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of citizens as much more important than defeating Westinghouse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, the Government will ensure that any action taken is consistent with the various established <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-59-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is developed a conspiracy to subvert it can operate under the protection of the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> to which it is directly or indirectly opposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I am concerned, there are a number of fundamental <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> to which every person is entitled and of which he should not be deprived except by the due process of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second and possibly more insidious threat to any effective enjoyment of our <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> is an attempt on the part of many governments to disclose as little significant information as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is perfectly clear that we are placing on record that we want more open thought, more discussion, more <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and a more independent expression of attitude by this Parliament on foreign affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have given deep thought to this subject, and we feel that we want more <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and more open discussion in the Australian community, because we believe that the Australian community should be better informed on foreign affairs than it is at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, the profession’s wholehearted co-operation will provide it with the best possible guarantee of preservation of the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> which individual doctors now enjoy and the best possible protection of the profession’s own interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Communists believe they should get into a country and use all the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of democracy - free speech, free gathering, free association and no censorship - to obtain their ends until the country is brought to its knees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite honourable members opposite to name any of the other countries that they admire so much in which these <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> are permitted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This doctrine comprises the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of navigation and overflight, of fishing and of laying submarine cables and pipe-lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event, he has a right to make a free political choice within our democratic society, that is, to exercise certain liberties and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> which inherently belong to an individual within a democratic environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If approaches have been made, can he say whether the Governments of any of these countries, and which, have restricted democratic <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of political opponents not engaged in armed rebellion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe in private enterprise because of its respect for individual <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> - freedom of choice tempered by considerations of the public interest - for out of that in the long term will come the correct way to proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The member nations of GATT are known as and spoken of in the GATT as contracting parties, because they contract as members of GATT to forgo certain <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> in trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here, with all the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> that are afforded debate in this place, we can look for security against some of the difficulties and the dangers that I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that there are many times when the excuse that we are undermining <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> is used by those who themselves would desire to undermine the freedom and security of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the world in which we must live and make our contribution contains much rivalry for power, great ideological conflicts which directly attack our basic principles and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>, a world in which one great group of power holds the principles of the Charter of United Nations in defiant contempt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My recollection is that Gibbon said that Augustus was conscious that mankind is governed by names and that if he respectfully assured the people that they still possessed their ancient <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> they would submit to slavery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At stake in Australia today are the people’s <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>, which are being challenged by the way in which the Government is behaving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said there was legal provision for various democratic <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is remarkable, when young people are conscripted to go to a war and make the maximum sacrifice in some cases and a great sacrifice in all cases, ostensibly to protect our <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and way of life that companies such as Broken Hill Pty Company Limited and Mount Isa Mines Ltd, which are making booming profits this year, do not make sacrifices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I disagree with the Minister, as does the Community Standards Organisation, when he argues that ‘the concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and women who believe in the basic <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Berlin provides a classic example of a city divided into  2  parts, in this case West Berlin and East Berlin- and God forbid that we should ever see West Berlin denied the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> that the people of East Berlin enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are very important social issues which have been debated peripherally while the debate has continued, such as the individual <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of persons and the extent to which governments and parliaments should intrude into the homes and lives of people and the extent to which they should keep out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710223_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First, the Bill seeks to ensure that racial discrimination should be proscribed by law and fundamental rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>, without distinction as to race, should be guaranteed by law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The chief feature of that Bill, as honourable members will recall, and its pertinence to the matter now being discussed is that by the introduction of penalties we will be able to achieve what understanding and reason have not been able to achieve previously, notwithstanding that the resolution, as evidenced in the Schedule attached to the Racial Discrimination Bill, insists that we are to promote and encourage universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> for all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The result is that there is now agreement that the events which led to the ministerial changes have been properly responded to, but I do not believe that the House can easily press on to other issues without fairly acknowledging the valuable and honourable role of the honourable member for Lalor to this institution over many years and his honourable and unyielding commitment to the issues of personal rights, civil liberties and the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of a democratic society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-139-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the existence of an independent legal profession is vital for the adequate protection of the individual against the state- that point was made very well by the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott)-  and the proper protection of individual <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>, rights and property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I find that disgraceful, a breach of the spirit of our Constitution, and totally against the basic <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> that we in Australia applaud. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly do not understand why Qantas should be able to undertake agreements which are totally contrary to the foreign policy of this country and totally contrary to all the basic <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> that we have long cherished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A second case concerns the rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of the individual- subscriber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister examine all relevant Commonwealth laws to determine whether any rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> conferred on any citizen by those laws will prevail over any attempted subtraction from the citizen’s right to personal freedom or freedom of assembly by the laws of the State of Queensland? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One ofthe greatest <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> that we enjoy in Australia is religious freedom- the right to worship as we see fit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, the rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of the Australian people are the most jealously guarded in the Western world and are the envy of many nations both near to and far from our shores. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We witness almost daily the steady stripping away of individual <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>- of a person’s right to disagree and to have a meaningful opportunity to influence the management of the affairs of his country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To understand that issue requires the question relating to fundamental <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> to be resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take on board the point that the honourable member for Bonython so aptly made- and I share his concern- about the preservation of basic <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> in one’s own home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation that I am today introducing represents a balance between the needs of the nation for a strong, reliable and highly efficient security service and the need to preserve our individual rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it unbelievable that a government that talks about these religious <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> can introduce legislation to allow listening devices to be placed in the confessional, in the office of a solicitor, in the office of the medical practitioner, and in the office of an accountant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular the Commonwealth should seek to enhance the co-ordination of its activities with those of other organisations similarly committed to the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has to be kept secure is not simply a physical entity; the society which exists within Australia is one with standards and principles which secure rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> as well as obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That society is not to be safeguarded by a repudiation of those standards or those principles with the consequent erosion of rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am fearful of the infringements to the civil rights, liberties and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of the Australian people that have been upheld since federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australians, many of whom fought in these wars to overthrow fascist regimes and to protect the rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of the individual, are now being placed in an insidious position of having to look at the prospect of a new form of fascism in their own backyards of clean, respected Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am certainly hopeful that Australia will never curtail the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> or liberties of the people as has been done in some of the countries in South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do so because people listening to this debate might think that neither this Government,  Mr Justice  Hope, nor ASIO itself, has any regard for the individual rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government knows, as did  Mr Chifley  and the Menzies Government before us, that in this area there is a delicate balance between those individual rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and the security of our nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We value our <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and we mean to preserve them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of this great country of ours, Australia, where we have fought to preserve <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>, face penalties of up to $400 if they even think in imperial measurements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those imposed in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order … the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One needs to look at the amendments set out in clause 36 within the context of the whole range of measures that this Government has brought in to restrict the rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of people involved in industrial action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We share the same ideals and the same <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The civil rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of Soviet citizens are very much subordinate to the interests of the Soviet State; this is made clear in the Soviet Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The participating states will respect human rights and fundamental <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> including the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are able to make this report the Christmas best seller for 1979 then we will have played some small part in helping those who are still fighting for basic human <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If people had democratic <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>, the nationality questions would be resolved in a democratic manner inside the United Soviet Socialist Republics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Soviet Union now has some of the problems of the rest of the world in regard to these matters but, it does have <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is obvious to honourable members on both sides of the Parliament, having come from the kind of society in which we live, that there are other <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> which often transcend that, including the freedom to be free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that we could ever be fierce enough in the defence of our <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and of the standards which we require to ensure that the systems of authority within our community are answerable; even at times of crisis, they can be made accountable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is suggested that the following sub-section be inserted after sub-section (3):  (3a) Where, in proceeding in a court in respect of an offence, objection is taken to the admission of evidence on the ground that the evidence was obtained in contravention of, or in consequence of a contravention of, or in consequence of a failure to comply with, a provision of this Act, in relation to a person, the court shall not admit the evidence unless it is, on the balance of probabilities, satisfied that admission of the evidence would specifically and substantially benefit the public interest without unduly prejudicing the rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of any person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would lead to greater <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> for the dealers we all, with one accord, want apprehended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by inserting after sub-section (3) the following sub-sections: “(3a) Where, in proceedings in a court in respect of an offence, objection is taken to the admission of evidence on the ground that the evidence was obtained in contravention of, or in consequence of a contravention of, or in consequence of a failure to comply with, a provision of this Act, in relation to a person, the court shall not admit the evidence unless it is, on the balance of probabilities, satisfied that admission of the evidence would specifically and substantially benefit the public interest without unduly prejudicing the rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of any person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a guarantee of a double onus in this new section, that where there is a suggestion that one had evidence which is illegal and cannot be used, there is still a chance for the prosecution to say that the gravity of the situation is such that it is in the public interest to use it and that it would not unduly prejudice the rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of any person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by inserting after sub-section (6) the following sub-sections: “(6a) Where, in proceedings in a court in respect of an offence, objection is taken to the admission of evidence on the ground that the evidence was obtained in contravention of, or in consequence of a contravention of, or in consequence of a failure to comply with a provision of this Act, in relation to a person, the court shall not admit the evidence unless it is, on the balance of probabilities, satisfied that admission of the evidence would specifically and substantially benefit the public interest without unduly prejudicing the rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of any person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I find it absolutely incredible, when we are talking about such basic <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>, that we are encountering the opposition that we have had this afternoon and that we had in the chamber only last week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
