<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In conjunction with other nations, notably the United States of America, we wish to ensure that the people of South Vietnam have the right to live under a system of democracy, with free elections and all the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> that we in this country particularly enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Health made it abundantly clear that the care of the health of the people was the prime consideration of the Government in this matter, and I have no doubt that the scheme, consistent with the proposals outlined in the Government’s policy speech, will eventually emerge for the good health of the people of Australia and will be consistent with the responsibilities and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of the medical profession, whatever those responsibilities be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a tragic story but is also a story of great courage because when people seek to exercise their basic <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> the great sagas of the world are written. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And whereas our existing Australian Flag and our national anthem, ‘God Save The Queen’, are perpetual reminders of these hard-won <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and of the wise British principle of the division of power, so well reflected in our own Australian Constitution with its careful separation of powers as between the Crown and Commonwealth Parliament, the Senate, the State Parliaments, the GovernorGeneral and State Governors, and the Independent Courts of Justice, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Australian Government is granting freedom and independence to Papua and New Guinea, the once free Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are occupied by the Soviet Union and their citizens are continuously and brutally deprived of personal, civil and religious <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we bring migrants of various nationalities and ethnic groups into this country we give them the great <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of the country to enjoy all the basic things we have created. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> given to them they established this clandestine organisation which they felt could reconstitute from Australia an ideology, religion or attitude that was long past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Ukraine, a nation of some 50 million people, is deprived of those national and individual rights and human <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> which are deemed sacred in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will such cuts, if instituted: (a) limit the scope of valuable research; (b) interfere with traditional <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of universities; (c) abandon terms of service regarded as part of their contract by university staff many of whom are from overseas; and (d) reduce opportunities for international contacts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-46-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Everyone is entitled to all the rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> set forth in the Declaration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia, as a Member State of the United Nations, is pledged to achieve observance of Human Rights and <span class="highlight">Freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it were not so the result would be to destroy the very <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and rights that it has taken us so many years to achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conference declares that, so far as Vietnam is concerned, the settlement of political problems, effected on the basis of respect for the principles of independence, unity, and territorial integrity, shall permit the Vietnamese people to enjoy the fundamental <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>, guaranteed by democratic institutions, established as a result of free general elections by secret ballot . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the editorial in today’s ‘Australian’ said:  lt is a moratorium on ‘business as usual’ at home while a disastrous war continues in Vietnam; a harsh reminder of facts the Australian Government would prefer forgotten; an exercise of democratic <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> to express strongly-held convictions with due force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is  a  moratorium on ‘business as usual’ at home while a disastrous war continues in Vietnam; a harsh reminder of facts the Australian Government would prefer forgotten; an exercise of democratic <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> to express strongly-held convictions with due force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Law is the rule under which the lights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of individuals are protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To destroy respect for the law is to destroy something of everyone’s rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once that tendency develops there is always the risk that the basic <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> which everybody wants to enjoy may be lessened in some way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole of our Australian democracy is built around our complete <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to enjoy the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> that we have in our Parliament which enable honourable senators to speak on matters to which they want to speak and which are not necessarily germane to the discussion current at that time, I believe that it is very desirable, in fact essential, that they should have the opportunity open to them by moving as a matter of urgency that the Senate at its rising adjourn until some time other than the normal time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are getting a reputation all over the world for being racist and for denying the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> which are accepted elsewhere as the heritage of ail humans - the basic human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This repressive Government is destroying the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> to which we are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the exercise of his rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I venture to suggest that someone who has the reputation of having done a great deal to ensure that there was no recognition and respect for the rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of others and did not meet the just requirements of public order and the general welfare in a democratic society is someone who may well be not admitted to this country to carry on in the way in which he obviously has carried on in the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing in this Declaration may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> set forth herein. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> must have some limitations imposed upon them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The laws which are passed in this country are laws which are essentially designed to promote the freedom of the greatest number and because they involve restrictions on some they enlarge the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and abilities of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very difficult to do this because we must pre serve and maintain the basic rights of all Australians and preserve and maintain their <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, if we have a few people who oppose those <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> an(. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>create licence, that makes it tremendously difficult, just because of the difficulty of controlling them, to maintain the ordinary basic <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of everybody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Moratorium people are those who in this case say that on grounds of civil rights and people’s <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> he ought be allowed to come here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are prepared to support the erosion of our fundamental <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we deny fundamental <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>, my Party will suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Liberal Party denies these fundamental <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> to its own members, it will suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Labor Party breaks fundamental <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>, it is the entitlement of  Senator Marriott  and everyone else to get up in this chamber and denounce the Party for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must insist upon these fundamental <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> wherever they are threatened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not stand by while this Government makes a mockery of human <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>, keeps out of Australia people like  Dr Mandel  and keeps other people from visiting New Guinea because it is ashamed of what it is doing there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That they welcome the statement by the Honourable the Minister for Customs and Excise,  Mr Chipp,  that the concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and women who believe in the basic <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and that, as a philosophy, it is evil and ought to be condemned - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, insofar as the Democratic Labor Party has always supported the contention that reasonable charges should be borne by the people of the Australian Capital Territory, we have pressed accordingly for corresponding <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and liberties in the domestic, municipal and even Federal government areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us leave a few <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> with our growers, but let us also do the best that we can for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe we are leaving certain <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> with the growers so that they have a chance to use various methods of selling their wool - even private selling, if they so desire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So again we have <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> coming in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However much  Senator Young  likes those nice words ‘<span class="highlight">freedoms</span>’ and ‘democracy*, we will be moving amendments to the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was keen to mention <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>wonder how far one can take these <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> when they have placed the wool industry in the position it is in today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once an outside body uses that as a criterion to take action and is able to enforce this action then we can say goodbye to any concept of democratic parliamentary procedure, which is the very basis of the liberties and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and the national development of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are approving oi: the fact that they may be appointed and saying that they should show a sense of responsibility and not ask for undue <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> for those in universities which would not be granted to other sections of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, they recognised that respect for human rights and individual <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and the avoidance of any kind of discrimination constitute the indispensable basis of all social welfare development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard a lot of noise from the House of Representatives .over the last year or two about bringing in legislation to protect the offshore areas of this country, but we do not see any suggestion that any of the laws are likely to be implemented, because they will restrict the business <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of some of the friends of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we indulge ourselves in the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> to which I have referred and if we are prepared to pay even lip service to the fact that they carry responsibilities, of necessity these responsibilities involve some restrictions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I despise those who would undermine our society by the attacks they make upon the police who endeavour to preserve the rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of our people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we have those <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> in relation to the system, if we have the freedom to exercise the right to speak in Parliament, if we have the right of Parliament to exercise supervision over the Executive, then again we have the practical day to day necessities for the preservation of the rights and liberties of individual subjects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>At the same time it has to strike a sensible balance to ensure that those who wish to dissent and those who wish to demonstrate are protected and given that right so long as this does not mean that they interfere with the rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Really I suppose that the necessity to make this loan available to the Shepparton Preserving Company in order to rescue this industry in its present circumstances is almost as great as the reasons which drive us to make available at rates of interest which are lower than those applying generally in the community money for the purpose of building homes for the men who served this country in the hours when our <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> were being challenged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a black ban has been placed upon 5 farmers on Kangaroo Island by some trade unions because nonunion labour was employed during shearing, will the Attorney-General make inquiries to see whether any legal action can be taken to assist these farmers to defend their rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> against the militant actions of these trade unions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have become aware of the fact that black bans have been imposed by certain union organisations which apparently would deny to certain persons the right to engage in freedom of employment, which right has long been one of the things for which the trade union movement has fought.I think that not only is it a denial of ordinary <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of people to prevent them from continuing in their employment but also it is denial of what every Australian should regard as something basic to his country’s future and something which he would desire to protect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All [ intended to say, and allI think I did say, in response to  Senator Young’s  question was that boycotts and black bans are denials of essential <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> - denials which I believe all Australians abhor - and the easiest way of rectifying the wrong is for union members not to engage in black bans which deny to other persons the right to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clearly, it is the mark of any civilisation that society should be concerned about the various essential <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of man- his freedom of speech, his freedom of association, his freedom to voice opinions and generally his basic right to his humanity We know that in the interests of society there must always be some limitations which must be imposed upon absolute freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A basic provision of the legislation is to provide that everyone is entitled to the fundamental rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> set out in the legislation, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Universal Declaration proclaims in its first Article that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and Article 2 provides that everyone is entitled to all the rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> set out in the Declaration, without distinction of any kind, including discrimination on grounds of race, colour or national origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this Bill, we have made provision for committees of inquiry whose functions relate to the services provided to pensioners but I wish to stress that we will be consulting with the medical profession to ensure that, on the one hand, there is no abuse of the medical benefits system and, on the other, that the professional <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of doctors are protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The important point I make about the health insurance program and the changes which are taking place in the industrial relations field is simply that in both areas the Government’s policies represent an enlargement of the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am indeed worried that at a time when the Government is concentrating quite rightly on the economic problems which are severe in Australia it might do so to the detriment of the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> which we have enjoyed up till now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are many notable countries in the world which have demonstrated that a magnificent economic recovery can be obtained with, at the same time, the loss of a major amount of the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> which the community had enjoyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I end by centring my regard and giving an example of what can happen to our <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to refer to the Privacy Bill which was passed through the lower House of the South Australian Parliament, controlled by a Labor administration, in 1974 and to indicate to the House briefly how our <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> can easily disappear if an administration believes that it is being pursued by the media, as it would appear at least  Senator Withers  believes he is so pursued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this late hour I shall refer only to the relevant clause on how our <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> would have disappeared in South Australia had the Legislative Council passed the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>May I respond to the question first of all by pointing out what  Senator Walters  will know already, that is, that individual universities are autonomous organisations- and rightly sooperating under charters to protect their acadamic <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Act has a more general application to discrimination based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, and makes it unlawful for a person to do an act involving racial discrimination which impairs the enjoyment, on an equal footing of fundamental rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-18">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Helsinki Agreement, a copy of which I hold in my hand, contains very clear obligations which are headed in Part VII ‘Respect for human rights and fundamental <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>, including the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of that attitude the Senate, through its Regulations and Ordinances Committee, has protected the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and the rights of all Australian citizens for a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The taking away in the future of the right of the individual to choose his own vocation and employer is only one of the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> the Australian people must be prepared to forgo in the interests of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All these sorts of <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> are relative and must, in a sense, be examined on their merits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suppose the answer to their question is that they constitute the first cab off the rank in terms of relative <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>, because the evidence against the product of the tobacco industry in terms of health seems to me to be absolutely compelling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But underlying all our beliefs about the nature of society is a deep and enduring commitment to democratic principles, to <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of speech, belief, assembly and association and to the administration of society by legally enacted statute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That we believe one of the essential <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> which contribute to genuine democracy is freedom of access to information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-1-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to quote in this debate the 4 <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> which have been incorporated in the Charter of the United Nations and to which, I suggest, both sides of this House subscribe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is with these fundamental <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> that civil liberties are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We live in a world striving to find ways for men and women to improve their standards of life and, at the very least, to achieve one of the fundamental <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>- freedom from want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by referring to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which within its list of fundamental <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> talks about the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been mentioned already as one of the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> to which the Government is committed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A large part of those <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> which I have just mentioned is the right of the individual to choose his own employment and to choose to join or not to join any organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Covenant provides that each State Party is to ensure, among other things, that any person whose rights or <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> as recognised in the Covenant are violated shall have an effective remedy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth has proposed that a Human Rights Commission be established as a joint Commonwealth-State venture, that would examine and report on allegations of infringements of the rights or <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> recognised in the Covenant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once that has been done the legislation will fit in very clearly and closely with Liberal Party policy concerning individual rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is beyond me why the Opposition is so against individual rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I certainly congratulate the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia,  Mr Tonkin,  for the very fine campaign he is now leading to free South Australia from the tyranny of the Dunstan Government in relation to its shopping <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Polls have shown that well over 80 per cent of South Australians are seeking to enjoy the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> that Victorian and New South Wales people enjoy and they will vote accordingly at the next State election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst the Labor Party today raises this issue of shipbuilding <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> in South Australia are disappearing under the repressions of Labor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can he comment on any dangers to our <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> evident at the present time in some of our tertiary institutions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Specifically, the Queensland Aborigines Act 1971-1975 and the Torres Strait Islanders Act 1971-1975 and associated regulations limit the rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in Queensland in comparison with those enjoyed by other Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the representative system is to survive then we can no longer order our politics so that those of us who share basic under-lying assumptions about <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>, about the supremacy of the individual over the state, continuously light each other in essentially mock adversorial political battles … We must also have the courage to call a halt to the increasing growth of those institutions, the state, the unions, the bureaucracies which are weakening our resistance to incursions on liberty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have done in recognising land rights for Aboriginals is to offer the universal freedom of personal liberty and private dignity inherent in Liberalism to Aboriginals so that they may choose their own life styles and live by their own culture and enjoy the same <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> as all other citizens of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was not concerned about their rights or <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has taken it upon itself responsibly to bring in legislation to protect the rights and the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of individuals in this country, and that includes members of the trade unions in this country who at the present time are bring tied down by so many of the radical shop stewards involved in some of the trade unions throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very worried that if what I have suggested does happen we will more rapidly than I otherwise would have expected attain the status of some sort of banana republic which has the respect of no country which would aspire to democratic <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> equivalent to those to which I hope members of this Parliament do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have complete faith in the safeguards being sufficient to maintain- indeed, to expand- the <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> that we in Australia have cherished for so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a government which talks at great length about individual rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>, about increasing the freedom of choice, about putting money into people ‘s pockets and enabling people the choice of how that money is spent and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, several speakers in the Address-in-Reply debate- not all those speakers have been from this side of the chamber- have pointed out that there is a very serious and distressing disparity between what a Fraser Government is prepared to say about individual <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and liberties and what it in fact does on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the quorum was called I was pointing out to the Senate that during the AddressinReply debate speakers representing various political views have developed a theme, namely, the disparity between what the Government is prepared to say about individual <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and rights and what the Government is prepared to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view it is worse than useless- it is hypocritical- to talk about <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and about ensuring and guaranteeing the right of free choice and so forth if the Government is not prepared to put its money where its mouth is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a government is not prepared to establish programs to make resources available for people to exercise their <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>, those <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> on paper are useless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I am on this theme of individual <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and the importance of basic democratic rights to us in the Parliament I shall mention briefly the situation of broadcasting in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That fact stands in alarming contrast to the expressions of individual <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and so forth with which the Governor-General ‘s Speech was cluttered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The measures which have been announced today strike the balance between the need to respond decisively to the threat of terrorism and the imperative of preserving Australia’s character as an open society and the democratic <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> we all hold paramount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have also become aware that freedom of choice, freedom of association, freedom of speech and many other <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> which are sometimes glibly spoken of can be found only in a democratic society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I recall the parliaments that came after the Restoration and certainly after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, they passed a number of very great Bills- the Habeas Corpus Act, the Bill of Rights and certain great parliamentary measures- which brought about so many of our <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They relate to the powers of university authorities and the associations that exist on campuses; they relate also to the meaning, I believe, in this case in particular, of conscientious objection; and to the significant issue of the fundamental <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of individuals to which I referred at the outset, such as the freedom of association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That on the 10th December 1948, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted and proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which declares that, ‘Everyone is entitled to all the rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> set forth in the Declaration . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-0-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia, as a Member State of the United Nations, is pledged to achieve observance of Human Rights and <span class="highlight">Freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-0-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this situation I believe it is unfortunate that so many members of this Parliament still see the proper basis of our foreign relationships as being whether the country we are considering is communist or pro-communist rather than whether it observes human rights and basic human <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This perception, I believe, has led us to the excessively pro-Chinese stance that  Senator Georges  spoke about and to the claim that we should not be critical of the abuse of human rights or human <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> in countries such as South Korea or Indonesia for fear of upsetting trade with those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we sit back with complacency at the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea because we are justifiably horrified at the excesses of the Pol Pot regime, if we ignore the excesses of the Shah of Iran because he was pro- Western and then ignore the excesses of the Ayatollah Khomeini because he is allegedly anti-Marxist and ignore what his sort of religion will do to the women of that country and to the basic <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of people in that country, or if we remain silent about East Timor for fear of offending the Indonesians, we have no international standing and no right to be heard in international forums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the light of all the above allegations of racial discrimination on the part of the Queensland Government, I would draw attention to the fundamental <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and human rights which Australia guarantees to its citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is frequently contended in matters brought to my office that fundamental <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and human rights of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in the State of Queensland are limited or restricted or denied by the Queensland Government in its administration of Aboriginal and Islander Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition I have to report upon deficiencies in Commonwealth legislation, principally the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, in achieving even a proper inquiry into matters associated with the exercise of fundamental <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and human rights for all racial groups in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most people are prepared to accept some delay and some inefficiency in the workings of a democracy as the price they pay for safeguarding those <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is impossible within a democratic framework of government to protect those liberties and rights which are essential to our continued survival without some vigilance and some care directed to informing ourselves about the activities of those who would, by illegal or illicit and violent means subvert those liberties and overthrow those <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course the achievement of the desirable twin objective of political accountability and operational autonomy is always difficult, but a balance is required between the needs of the nation for a strong, reliable and highly efficient security service and the need to preserve our individual rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As my colleague  Senator Cavanagh  said, the special powers to be granted to ASIO, including powers of forced entry, search, removal of documents, bugging and the interception of mail, pose a grave threat to personal <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and open up a whole range of abusive activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that perhaps it is no coincidence that the Minister responsible for the introduction of the Norfolk Island Bill in this Parliament, with all the authoritarian apparatus it contains, with all the insensitivity it demonstrates towards democratic rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>, is none other than that same Minister, who is now in a different portfolio,  Mr R.

    <p>It is no use just looking at what they say; but if they say that with their system there will be greater <span class="highlight">freedoms</span>, more democracy and greater justice than under the systems existing elsewhere in the world, surely all of us have a necessity to examine how they do conduct their own societies so see whether their words and the claims they make about superiority of their system and the desirability of that system being adopted by other countries is borne out by what one sees practiced within their own society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>True it is that human rights are denned in this Bill as meaning the rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> recognised in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or in any relevant international instrument and true it would be that a general power under clause 9 ( 1 ) (c) to investigate matters relating to human rights would accordingly enable a good deal of the matters associated with the operation of the Covenant to be specifically dealt with; but our concern, for example, is with something like Article 4 1 of the Covenant which on its face is not concerned with the subject matter of any of these human rights but with the procedure whereby a state- that is, a country which is party to the Covenant- may declare its recognition of the competence of the international human rights committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without full consultation and full knowledge and understanding of administration and operations on reserves, Community Councils can only be regarded as fronts for achieving goals which appear alien to the enjoyment of fundamental <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> and human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>by inserting after sub-section (3) the following new sub-sections: (3a) Where, in proceedings in a court in respect of an offence, objection is taken to the admission of evidence on the ground that the evidence was obtained in contravention of, or in consequence of a contravention of, or in consequence of a failure to comply with, a provision of this Act, in relation to a person, the court shall not admit the evidence unless it is, on the balance of probabilities, satisfied that admission of the evidence would specifically and substantially benefit the public interest without unduly prejudicing the rights and <span class="highlight">freedoms</span> of any person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></li>
