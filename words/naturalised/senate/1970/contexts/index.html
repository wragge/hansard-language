<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It is also assumed in the information I give that  Senator Mulvihills  question refers to <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians of Yugoslav origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could the Minister give any indication of just what the position is concerning the <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian who is at present facing a capital charge in the Supreme Court of South Africa? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: What is the Government’s attitude  towards the deportation of migrants who have already been <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could he give the nature of these new issues and could he also state why this Parliament had not previously been informed of any action to protect Australian <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> citizens in Yugoslavia subsequent to that raid into Yugoslavia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Yugoslav Ambassador told the AttorneyGeneral that 3 <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians had been executed, did the Attorney-General institute any inquiries as to the conduct in Australia of the 3 persons concerned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attorney-General that 3 <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians who were originally Croatians had been executed, will the Attorney-General inform the Senate, firstly, where that conversation took place and, secondly, whether other matters were mentioned during that conversation; also, will he now give to the Senate in substance the whole of that conversation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 hope never again to meet the situation that I found in Darwin where a youngster said: ‘Yesterday I was <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>; today I can speak my mind.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter should be dealt with promptly, because if we are to secure migrants we will have to give social service rights to migrants who have been <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provided a person becomes <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>, he should be given that right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like him to be a <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise this matter because this Spanish migrant, who has sought twice to be <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>, has been refused naturalisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do a number of these persons have other children who are not only resident in Australia, but, indeed, are <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians, and does this policy discriminate against certain people, in that those who have no children can be admitted to Australia, but those with children who are minors are refused admission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700407_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cite the case of  Mrs Milena  Spicar who was <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> in January 1965 at Ashfield in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why was Basil d’Oliveira, a <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Briton of Indian descent, dropped from the English Test cricket team that will tour South Africa later this year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reply to (e) and (g):  Mrs Heisler  was born at Copenhagen and was <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> in Britain in 1948. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the question of land rights I point out that land rights are given to <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> British subjects from almost all countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The term ‘certain other persons’ is intended to include <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians and the Australian-born offspring of immigrants who require instruction in the English language, as well as those who are immigrants under the definition already described. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill describes them as ‘certain other persons’ which means certain <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians and the Australian born offspring of migrants who require English instruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask him whether he will look into whether the law can be altered to provide that <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians shall be treated for all purposes as Australians and not be liable to deportation or cancellation of citizenship except, say, in cases of substantial fraud in the application for citizenship? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to refer to a matter that was raised originally on 19th August when
               Senator Murphy  asked a question of the newly
            appointed Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  in
            relation to whether the law could be altered to provide that <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians
            shall be treated for all purposes as Australians and not be liable to deportation or
            cancellation of citizenship except, say, in cases of substantial fraud in the
            application for citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal was that
          <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians should be treated for all purposes as Australians and not be
          liable for deportation or cancellation of citizenship except for substantial fraud in
          application for citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think, however, before one examines what is involved in the
            proposition, that it is important to recognise that there is a period of time, between
            when a migrant comes into this country and when he is <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> and therefore
            becomes an Australian citizen, when he is liable to deportation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that section 13 of the Act indicates
            that a person who is in Australia, not yet <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> and therefore not an Australian
            citizen, who commits certain specific offences which are set out in the legislation,
            is liable to deportation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am dealing with the position between when he comes into the country and when
              he becomes <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question which was asked of me
          by  Senator Murphy  on 19th August last was a question
          which in general terms asked me to look into whether the law can be altered to provide
          that <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians shall be treated for all purposes as Australians and not
          liable for deportation or cancellation of citizenship except, say, in cases of
          substantial fraud in the application for citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should say in passing
          that there are provisions contained in the Citizenship Act at present whereby
          citizenship can be taken away from a person who has been <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> if there is fraud
          in the application which was made for the citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I
          would believe that we are in a position where, if a person is an Australian citizen,
          whether he be an Australian citizen by the fact that he has been born in Australia or
          whether he is an Australian citizen by virtue of the fact that he has been <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>,
          there ought to be an equality of treatment and these provisions do offend against that
          concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just recently I read of a Greek migrant in Melbourne who had made application on 7 occasions to be <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> and who, on 7 occasions, was refused in spite of the fact that he had been in this country for 39 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet this Government insists further that he shall not be <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the break-down on a nationality basis of the 27,343 persons who were <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (c) The Annual Return to Parliament of persons granted Australian citizenship during 1970-71 by virtue of the grant of certificates of citizenship under Sections 15 and 12 of the Citizenship Act, 1948-1969, provides both a breakdown on a nationality basis of the 27,343 persons <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>, and the countries of origin of the 7,750 persons who were registered as Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is a <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian of Dutch origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#debate-68">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of discrimination between Australian born and Australian <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> citizens visiting Fiji and the amount of the bond which some have to give was therefore not discussed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1954-55, when he became <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>, he did his training with the Citizen Military Forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The classic area of double standards, however, involves the cases of Greeks and Spaniards either <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> or unnaturalised who approach Commonwealth parliamentarians with problems which involve their dependants in those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-57-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We wanted to give portability to those who have worked in the Australian community irrespective of whether they had become formally <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be reiterated that the new provisions apply equally to all migrants, whether <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> or not, as well as to all Australians whether or not they are migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the recent misunderstanding that occurred over a French army call-up notice served on French-born <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian  Mr Thomas  Gable, can the Minister supply a list of nations who can or do make such a claim on people born in such countries, but who are now Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as to the particular case, I am advised the man in question was born in France and has since become a <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Australian Government received any reports of <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian Greeks returning to Greece for a short time and, being of military age, being either conscripted into the Greek Army or having to pay a sum of money to be allowed to leave Greece. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian male citizens of Greek origin have been called up for military service on their return to the land of their birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is because they do not, under Greek law, lose their Greek citizenship when they are <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those facts were, from recollection, that 5 - it may have been 6 - of the persons whose names were handed to the Press by the Yugoslav Government were <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But now, because it has come to light that <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians have been killed in other countries in acts of rebellion, the Government is trying to brush off the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs afford the Senate any information on the claim given publicity today that a <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian citizen who was not born in Yugoslavia on a visit to Yugoslavia  has been deprived of his liberty on the plea that he owes military service to that country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt, it involves the obligations which European countries impose upon their citizens, even though they have become <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> abroad, to undergo military service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the event of persons being convicted of sabotage and terror or conspiring to commit acts of sabotage and terror such as the recent bombings in Sydney, will the Government deport such people if they are not <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> citizens of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What steps can the Government take regarding deportation if such persons are recently <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> citizens of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, for all its talk, can always find out why somebody should not be <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the penalty which people who come to Australia as our guests should face, even though they become <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>, if they commit so many of these acts which are completely foreign to the Australian way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the New Australian Council of the Party be made aware of the oath of allegiance sworn by new Australian citizens when being <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> that I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen’; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today I received a letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr N. H. Bowen)  in which he said that on 12th September I asked whether any information could be given about a <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian citizen who was not born in Yugoslavia but who had been deprived of his liberty in Yugoslavia on the basis that he was required to do military service for that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Jurman came to Australia on 1st February 1965 having travelled from Austria, the place of his birth, and he became a <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Austraiian citizen on 29th September 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to an injustice done to a person holding an Australian passport - a  Mr Pilioras  an Australian of Greek descent who migrated to Australia in October 1953 and was <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> in I960. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After further inquiry the director told him that the Greek Consul-General had taken this action because when  Mr Pilioras  was <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> in Australia he surrendered his Greek passport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that officers of the Department of Immigration should advise migrants from countries such as Greece that have compulsory military service that irrespective of whether they are <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> in Australia they retain their former nationality and on returning to their former country, irrespective of how long they had been away from it, will be required to undergo military training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although there is a provision in the law that <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> citizens may be deported in certain circumstances, I believe and the Government believes that this should not be a part of the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is rather unfortunate for Opposition senators that they should have been making precisely that point this day because only this day - I am not divulging any secret knowledge - the parliamentary Labor Party resolved, at the instance of the Government, to amend the Crimes Act to provide that no <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian citizen shall be deported from this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Opposition senators say that we intend to act under section 30a of the Crimes Act in relation to unlawful organisations and that we intend to legislate for deportation of certain <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> citizens under section 30c of the Crimes Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The failure of the Senate to establish this committee of inquiry, together with the failure of the Government to establish a judicial inquiry, would be interpreted by <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Croatians as meaning that they are truly second class citizens; that they can be defamed under parliamentary privilege with no redress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Could honourable senators opposite go to a new Australian who has been <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> and say to him: ‘Is not it a terrible, arbitrary and excessive power being exercised by this Government which has now passed a law which says that you can no longer be deported?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a provision in the legislation, to which there has already been reference, under which persons who are not <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> and who are migrants can become members of the Public Service provided that, in the opinion of the Governor-General, there is no detriment to the national security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Carrick  said that it should be determined by the number of electors and that those migrant groups- the ethnic minorities which tend to be heavily concentrated in Sydney and Melbourne- should not be counted for purposes of determining electoral boundaries because they are not <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> citizens and do not have a vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Scott’s argument, namely, that the effectiveness of representation should be the primary factor determining the size demographically of an electorate, or he is saying that the ethnic minorities, which tend to be concentrated in the inner city seats, and consist of people who are not yet <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians, are not entitled to any parliamentary representation by the members who represent those districts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A company which achieves 5 1 per cent Australian ownership and has an Australian board- as outlined above- would be classified as a <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> company, lt would be able to proceed with new projects in its own right, in partnership with an Australian company, a <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> company or a naturalising company, within the Government’s guidelines for new projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Privy Council eventually decided that because they were <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian citizens and British subjects and owners of the vessel, the vessel was a British ship within the meaning of an imperial statute of, I think, 1799 and that the criminal law of England- in this case the Theft Act- applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a strong argument that in any official document the Australian Government should not appear to make distinctions between <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> and natural-born citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Briefly, I indicated at that time that many migrants who are <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians, or in some cases their children who are natural born Australians, may be regarded by their countries of birth, or of the parents’ birth, still to be citizens of those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The anomaly to which I refer is that part of the present Migration Act which makes it possible for someone who is a <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian citizen nonetheless to be deported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But regrettably that exercise was not accomplished, in my view anyway, with full efficacy and those provisions still remain in the Migration Act which make it possible for someone to be deported even though he is a <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well established that, as a matter of Federal constitutional law, persons can continue to be regarded as immigrants if they are born overseas and have come here from overseas, even after they have been <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I was seeking to make before the suspension of the sitting was that there are a couple of sections of the Migration Act, not proposed to be altered by anything in the Migration Amendment Bill 1979, which can be read in certain circumstances as enabling someone to be deported notwithstanding that that person has in fact become <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of law the situation seems to be that the concept of an immigrant is not necessarily one that ceases to apply when a persons becomes <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that they are not coextensive as a matter of law because a person can go on being an immigrant, as the law now stands, notwithstanding that he has been <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it is now possible under the citizenship legislation which came in in 1973 for a person to become <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> not after five years, but after three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments specifically removed from Crimes Act offences language which would equally have made it possible, so the argument went, for persons to be deported notwithstanding that they had become <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Bill seeks to repeal provisions which give to the Attorney-General the power to deport persons who are not natural born Australians- notwithstanding the fact that they may be <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians- and who have committed certain offences under the Crimes Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
