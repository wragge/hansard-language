  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can see no good reason why an act of discrimination against a person living in Australia who is not a <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian citizen should not attract the same provisions as acts of discrimination against persons who are Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Electoral Office strives to ensure that all eligible persons, not only those who become <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian citizens, apply for enrolment as soon as they become eligible to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Prime Minister aware that Germany has a contributory system of pensions and that these are not paid to German migrants to this country if they become <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian citizens? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Why does the Government insist that applicants for officer entry into the Royal Australian Navy be <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian citizens of at least 10 years standing if not Australian-born. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Agreement does cement the relationship with a country which the Minister said has already given to us over 100,000 people of whom 74% have seen fit to be <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> That in itself shows that not only are they establishing themselves but also they are undoubtedly prepared to accept the responsibilities of a new country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The term ‘certain other persons’ is intended to include <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians and the Australian-born offspring of immigrants who require instruction in the English language, as well as those who are immigrants under the definition already described. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my own electorate, largely because of the age distribution and partly because there are people who are not yet <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>, only 43% of the residents are enrolled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of these people are willing to become <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> but will not take an oath of allegiance to  Her  Majesty the Queen simply because they do not believe in monarchies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This law was enacted having in mind people who choose to come here to live and decide not to become <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I know of a case - and I would not think there would be very many people in exactly the same position- of a man who is now 75 years of age and who is a <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian citizen, having been <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> in 1962. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I ask him whether he has been <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>, in many cases he says no. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although he is over the age for an invalid pension and <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>, he is ineligible because he has not resided in Australia for 10 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of these people are <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> and many more are awaiting naturalisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope it will not be many years before we see the entry of an ex-migrant, a <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian citizen, taking his place side by side with his fellow Australians in one or our State Parliaments or in our National Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has his attention been drawn to a statement by the Acting Prime Minister of New Zealand,  Mr N.  Shelton, on 8 July 1970, that New Zealand had been trying for many years to have the principle accepted in its relations with Australia of no discrimination between natural born and <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conditions relating to entry into Australia are the same for persons born  in  New Zealand and those <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By administrative arrangement New Zealand citizens of European descent, whether natural born or <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>, may in general come to Australia without prior permission - from New Zealand or elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other New Zealand citizens, whether born or <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>  in  New Zealand are required to obtain prior permission to travel to Australia for any purpose except in direct transit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a Greek <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian 1 am disgusted and ashamed that these things should be allowed to take place in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he able to say whether <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian citizens from (a) Yugoslavia and (b) Greece are liable for national service when visiting their country of origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-42-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian citizens require a visa to enter New Zealand whilst British born Australians do not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-50-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All migrants to be <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> after 10 years in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many migrants have been <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> in each of the past five years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710310_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-3-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The percentage of enrolment varies according to the number of residents under age or not <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party wants to restrict the Redistribution Commissioners to a 10 per cent variation of the quota when drawing boundaries, not taking, into account the numbers of electors in those constituencies but the population as a whole, including a lot of new Australians who are not yet <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> and who have not yet got a vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously it is aimed at getting more electors into these large country divisions, making them even larger, and taking electors away from some of the electorates like Grayndler, West Sydney and Port Melbourne where there is already a high proportion of new Australians not yet enrolled who are wait ing to be <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the protests by the editor of the Melbourne published anti-Communist weekly and by many <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian citizens of Polish origin against the alleged action of the Polish Consulate in Australia in forbidding Polish travel agents in Australia to advertise in their newspapers, will the Government consider compensating publications which are victimised for printing facts to the best of their ability, in order to offset loss due to international trade sanctions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it the proclaimed intention of Australian Citizenship Acts to ensure there is no difference in the citizenship status of a natural-born or <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this provision apply not only to <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> migrants but also in cases where children of Australian parents who are overseas on business or as tourists, are born outside Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the intention, that <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> persons should have the same status as persons who become citizens at birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>, (3) and (4) The provisions of the Crimes Act are expressed to apply to all persons born outside Australia and not solely <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>., persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-14">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, why does the Department of Supply discriminate against <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> citizens? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no discrimination against <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> persons but it is necessary and proper, as I am sure all honourable members will understand, that inquiries be carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is be able to say whether many <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians of former German nationality now nearing or having reached retirement age are not receiving superannuation payments due to them from German sources? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-37-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I mention the number of people who are immigrants to this country, who have wanted to build a good life here for themselves, who have become <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>, who have put in 10, 12, 15 or 20 years hard work building the Snowy Mountains scheme and bringing about its completion, who have helped to construct Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such people have the problem of what the effect will be if they become <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My seventh consideration is this: How are our new settlers - new Australians - to know what manner of people we are, what is the ethos which guides and informs our attitudes and actions, and whether they wish to be <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> as Australian citizens? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In addition to that must we not go into the question of why 228,000 citizens refuse to become <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> even though they are eligible? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government supporters ask why people do not become <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> yet the Government penalises them if they do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the expectation of migrants in respect of social services, the availability of social service benefits including the age pension to <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians who have established eligibility; in other words, they have lived here for at least  10  years and have been taxpayers during that period, and should receive a pension irrespective of where they live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that only 53 per cent of Greeks eligible for naturalisation have become <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>ls ii also a fact that the late  Mr Leo  Buring, a distinguished Australian citizen who was <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> on his father’s certificate when he was only 7 years old, was compelled by the New Zealand Immigration Department, when he visited that country about 12 years ago at the age of 70, to also suffer the indignity of having to report to  a  police station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-44-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1’he New Zealand authorities advised in 1955 that <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian citizens were not treated as aliens in New Zealand or required to register as such.-  However until -October 1957 the New Zealand regulations required all <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian citizens to obtain prior permission to enter New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-44-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In October 1957, following representations by the Australian Government the permit requirement was waived for <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians for visits of less than three months and in December 1963 such persons were accorded unrestricted right of entry to New Zealand, subject to production of evidence of their citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-44-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it also a fact that many migrants in Australia are deterred from becoming <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> because dual nationality is not permitted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-59-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So even though they may work for 30 years after they have become <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>, they lose their rights for the first 3 years of their service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Riverina has quoted examples - and they are typical of other nationals - where a German who has become a <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian has not been able to receive his German pension on retirement and when he has gone to live in Germany he has not been able to receive his Australian pension on retirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposition which has hitherto been put by the Australian Government to European countries has been that while the Australian Government has received taxes and contributions from its <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> citizens when they were working in Australia, those other countries should pay their pensions when they went back to their homeland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That meant that 32 per cent of the people who could have been <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> had not been <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is now setting the clock back because if persons, whether natural born or <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>, are now to receive pensions when they live overseas they will under the Government’s Bill have had to live in Australia not just for 10 years, which is sufficient to entitle them to a pension if they continue to live in Australia, but for 20 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, it is important for us to try to protect, for example, the rights of certain German pensioners who, because they have become <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> as Australian citizens, have lost their rights to German pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of whether they become <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> in Germany or in Australia is not relevant to this point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We wanted to give portability to those who have worked in the Australian community irrespective of whether or not they had become formally <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Finally, let me reiterate that the new provisions apply equally to all migrants, whether <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> or not, as well as to all Australians whether or not they are migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will not go into detail but, as a result of representations made by the Minister,  Mrs Gable  and her 2 sons have now been <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> and an unfortunate incident in the Department of Immigration has been cleared up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The outer suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne have a minority of the population on the rolls because most of the people cannot be on the rolls either since they are not yet <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> or they are not yet adults. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there Is to be any reduction in our immigration intake, will he see that British, Irish and European people will be given precedence over people whose presence endangers, and will continue to endanger, the social, wage and housing conditions of Australians, whether bom here or <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that in respect of an Australian corporation operating in a community which already has within its shores somewhere near 1,500,000 people who are not <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> or who have not been in the country for very long, the provisions contained in this paragraph are unnecessary and may well inhibit the recruitment of staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If persons - whether natural born or <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> - are now to receive pensions when they live overseas they will have to have lived in Australia not just for 10 years, which is sufficient to entitle them to a pension if they continue to live in Australia, but for 20 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we did not pay pensions overseas to persons who had not been <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> we could exclude a large number of people - nearly a quarter of a million <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nearly a quarter of a million people who have come from other nations to live in Australia and who have qualified to be <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> as Australians have not been <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It transpires that 662,898 persons had been <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> up to the end of the last financial year, and the number of persons who were eligible to be <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> but who had - not been <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> was 311,952. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That meant that 32 per cent of the people who could  have been <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> had not been <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An important aspect of the Bill is that the benefits shall be paid irrespective of whether the person is a <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As previously mentioned, the new pensions will apply to all migrants, whether <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are all hopeful that migrants will eventually want to become <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> citizens and participate fully in our community, but if they for their own good reasons do not wish to relinquish their original citizenship we should not seek to discriminate against them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, at present a German migrant who may be in receipt of a German pension, should he become a <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian, would forfeit his pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intent of the Bill is to provide that in any reciprocal agreement this German migrant could become <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> without losing his German pension entitlement and, conversely, an Australian who is in receipt of some social service payment who goes to Germany and there becomes a <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> German citizen would not lose his Australian rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For some years the Government has applied the rule that Australians, whether they are native born or <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>, should have 10 years’ residence in Australia before they qualify for a pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may mention one in passing, even an Australian citizen who has been <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> can be deported from his own country - that is, Australia - if it is the wish of the Government to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I was saying before the mountain erupted, the Australian Labor Party’s amendment suggests that every migrant who comes to Australia should be <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> before he qualifies for an age pension and that after only 10 years in Australia he should be allowed to leave the country and take his pension with him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know families who have come to this country, the husband of which has decided to become <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>, but for her own private reasons the wife has been reluctant to do so too quickly, and sometimes many years have passed before she has become <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Labor Party is suggesting by its amendment that any person who does not choose to become a <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian should be ineligible for an age pension, a widow’s pension or any other pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said before this is discrimination in its worst form, that we in Australia would be sitting in judgment on the private motives of those who may or may not choose to become <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I could say much more, because I have many thousands of migrants, including <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> migrants, in my electorate, but because it is intended to pass this Bill before dinner I will now allow the Minister to conclude the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian pension is a good bit higher than most of the corresponding pensions in other countries, and we do not require a migrant to be <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> to be eligible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that a considerable number of migrants believe that a slur has been cast on the migrant community in general by the statement made on Tuesday by  Senator Murphy  and that many of them who are not yet <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> are fearful for their safety? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The latest incursion which worried me, as it worried my predecessor as Prime Minister and also worried my predecessor as Foreign Minister, was the incursion into a friendly nation by several persons, nine of whom had been resident in Australia and six of whom had been <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even though the electoral commissioners will distribute electorates on the basis of actual electors 1 hope they will also look at the matter from the point of view of the total population, realising that we represent not only people who will have a vote at the next election but also people who do nol have a vote either because they are too young or because they are not yet <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should be recalled that employees of ASIO make reports on a great number of people who, for instance, seek appointment or promotion in the Commonwealth Public Service, and on a great number of people who seek to be <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> as Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is why the Government has decided to amend the Crimes Act to prevent the deportation of <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> citizens and to repeal those sections of the Crimes Act which allow the deportation of members of declared organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This conjures up a picture of tens of thousands of British migrants seriously disaffected because they do not have the privilege of being <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> at a naturalisation ceremony and, instead, are seriously discriminated against by being able to acquire citizenship by registration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is clearly in the interest of Australia that our grant of citizenship be an exclusive one, that our political rights and obligations be the only ones to which <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian citizens are subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The House may recall that even before the Attorney-General made his statement in the Senate I took the opportunity to ask the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Grassby)  to give an undertaking, firstly, that no <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian citizen would be deported, and secondly, that even nonnaturalised Australian citizens convicted of some crime would not be deported to any totalitarian country if they had some political reasons to fear a return to that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to ask the Government to try to publicise in the migrant community the effect of this Bill so that the migrants - certainly <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> migrants - can be quite sure that they will not be deported from Australia and that they will not be sent back to any country which they fear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely the appropriate way to determine the numbers of electors in each State division is by means of a quota of electors properly enrolled and legally entitled to vote, not the number of people including the very young - even .the one and 2-year- olders and up to the 17-year old group - and the migrants who have not become <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> citizens of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As an example, in an area with 50,000 migrants, many of whom are not yet <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>, with 25,000 of them voting and 25,000 Australians voting there would be an electorate with 75,000 people and 50,000 voters, a vote in which the actual voter would be worth 50 per cent more people than in an electorate with a predominantly Australian grouping. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, a <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> company would, in the absence of special circumstances, be precluded from undertaking a project as a joint venture with a wholly overseas-owned company, as this would involve a departure from the 50 per cent guidelines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It should be recalled that often the presence of a high proportion of people of various migrant origin means that honourable members have to deal with not only their electors but also many thousands of people who are yet to be <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the old boundaries of my electorate there were two principal municipalities which always invited me to the ceremonies and sent me a list of those who were <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the query is raised I am told in a second-hand verbal way that if I make a written application I might get a list of those who are <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may proceed as a <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this category of being 25 per cent or more owned the company can be described as naturalising, which enables it to avoid Foreign Investment Review Board approval to develop a resource project on its own or with another Australian owned, <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> or naturalising company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On 24 October 1978  (Hansard,  page 2174) the honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  asked me a question, without notice, concerning pensions from the Federal Republic of Germany for German immigrants to this country who have become <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-49-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that many <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians and other Australians born outside Australia do not wish to have their place of birth stated on the passport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The place of birth of a <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Swiss citizen cannot, therefore, be deduced from that person’s passport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Fadden- who does not seem to have many so-called new Australians or <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians in his electorate- said that ‘we should not pander to the whims and wishes of those born overseas’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government goes out of its way to continue to insert the place or origin of these persons on passports, therefore clearly distinguishing between the passports of those who were born in Australia and <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a strong argument that in any official document the Australian Government should not appear to make distinctions between <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> and natural-born citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members make long speeches at naturalisation ceremonies about the benefits of becoming <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has restricted officer entry to the Royal Australian Navy to Australian born or to <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australian citizens of at least 10 years standing in order to protect the confidentiality of communications systems, traffic and cryptographic equipment used in the Service and to which Naval officers would inevitably have access by virtue of their service at sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The person working in the system has perhaps never been <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At some stage he puts in his application to be <span class="highlight">naturalised</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly, I indicated at that time that many migrants who are <span class="highlight">naturalised</span> Australians, or in some cases their children who are natural born Australians, may be regarded by their countries of birth, or of their parents’ birth, still to be citizens of those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
