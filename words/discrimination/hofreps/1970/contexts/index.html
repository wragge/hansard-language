  <li>
    <p>It was recognised that the existing Queensland legislation was designed to assist in protecting persons who, without guidance and assistance, could be subject to exploitation and that it was not, therefore, to be seen as <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On what dates, at what level, by what means and with what results have there been discussion with the Queensland and Western Australian governments since 3rd May 1971 (Hansard, page 2418) on the State laws whose provisions do not satisfy the requirements of the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Ministers discussed a range of matters including the general organisation of the administration of Aboriginal affairs; arrangements for consultation of Aboriginal opinion; recent legislative and administrative action in relation to Aboriginal reserves; problems and needs in the fields of health, housing, education and employment; and progress in combating <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-32-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of alt forms of Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> considered at the conference; if so, with what result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-32-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> practised by Australia in this respect based on skin colour: if so, what are the details? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710930_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> by other countries against Australian citizens on the basis of their colour meet with the approval of the Government; if not, why, does the Government apply <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against coloured citizens of New Zealand? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710930_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>ls there any evidence to show that Aborigines are the subject of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> by licensees of some hotels and clubs in country areas of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs will know that petitions are circulating in New Zealand calling on the government of New Zealand to act against Australian <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against New Zealand citizens of non-European and nonMaori racial origin and that yesterday notice was given in the New Zealand Parliament of a question critical of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: What protests and representations has the Government received from the New Zealand Government regarding the continuing <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against New Zealand citizens of non-European and non-Maori racial origin in entry requirements by Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Treasurer: What is the reason for what appears to be <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against a sector of the finance industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the second part of the question, I think the honourable gentleman should know or at least the House would know that on several occasions we have raised in the United Nations this question of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> on religious and other grounds and we have in particular drawn attention to the plight of Jewish people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What action is proposed by the Minister to remove this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister whether he can say what would be the effect on Australia of an immigration policy confined solely to sponsorship by Australian residents of relatives and friends, without the exercise of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that States’ Agents-General in London have complained to the Home Secretary regarding the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against and treatment of Australians entering Great Britain by immigration officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-19-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer him to a number of resolutions adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 14 December 1972, dealing with decolonisation and racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, which Australia supported and voted for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will ask that there be an examination of union rules to ensure that where there is any relic of this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against a person belonging to a union on the ground of race, the matter is brought to the notice of the union concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In cases of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> covered by the convention, they would then attempt to resolve the matter using their good offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, to what extent does this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> occur, and in what form? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is no improper <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, will the Minister refute reports that Australia is engaging in such <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there any evidence of police <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against Aboriginal persons in this area and, if regular weekly harassment is taking place, have the reasons for it been established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-45-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for Transport aware that the total Australian export shipment of oranges to New Zealand is at risk largely due to the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> exercised against Australian seamen by the New Zealand Seamen’s and Waterside Workers Union? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He appointed  Mr L.  Shilton as consultant to investigate allegations of police <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and to make recommendations about relationships between Aboriginals and the police, but no study group was set up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister have the report investigated as a matter of urgency, and if there is any truth at all in the report will he have all vestiges of this abominable form of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> immediately removed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, could the Minister indicate whether there has been any <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in assistance given to country areas in Queensland? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In point of fact there will be no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> whatever between the Northern Territory and Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not take up the time of the Committee for any period, because I know the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  wants to get on to the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Existing sub-clause (3) provides that Part II of the Act which prohibits racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, shall not apply to distinctions, exclusions, restrictions or preferences between Australian citizens and persons who are not Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can see no good reason why an act of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against a person living in Australia who is not a naturalised Australian citizen should not attract the same provisions as acts of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against persons who are Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister for Housing and Construction indicate whether there is any form of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in the manner in which accommodation is allocated in government hostels in Canberra or in other places in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, the stage would ultimately be reached where it would be quite impracticable to determine just where <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> should end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-37-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the great concern expressed by honourable members on both sides of the House on the implementation of certain recommendations of the Royal Commission on Petroleum, will the Minister comment on the findings of the Royal Commission that draw particular attention to price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and the activities of ACTU-Solo? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I leave aside some of the contentious recommendations and ask the Prime Minister: What action does the Government propose to take on some of the recommendations which would be deemed to be worthwhile and non-contentious, such as those concerning child abuse, <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against women, migrants, the handicapped, adoption and a national family policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These resolutions do not contravene the Commonwealth’s anti-<span class="highlight">discrimination</span> legislation (the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act 1975). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-73-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If, as was reported in the ‘Sydney Morning Herald’ of 12th January 1970, the honourable gentleman said that there was a policy of ‘glaring race <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in law in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea’ I say for my part that I know of no warrant for such a charge and that such a charge is utterly mischievous as well as being untrue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable gentleman used a comparison of that case with a case involving some indigenous inhabitants who had been charged with violence as a basis for saying that a difference in treatment between the two cases represented <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, all I can say is that the remarks of the senior magistrate in Rabaul are a complete refutation of the charge of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> made by the honourable gentleman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, at least today’s <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> on the grounds of race or colour is either formally disowned where it exists, or legally discouraged with varying degrees of conviction and success. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They range from the aged and needy in our great cities to the hungry people of India; from the orphans in Vietnam to the victims of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the provision of these there is, increasingly, <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against those living in new suburbs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked whether his attention had been drawn to attacks made by the Leader of the Opposition on the integrity of the courts in New Guinea and alleged racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this moment the Leader of the Opposition rose to his feet and burst in, saying that the matters which I purported to state could not be authenticated, namely, that he had made attacks on the integrity of the courts and alleged racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then the  Speaker  asked me whether I could vouch for the accuracy of the report; I take it, as I had mentioned no report, he meant the report of an attack on the integrity of the courts in New Guinea alleging racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So let us look closely, for instance, at the honourable member for Fremantle’s description, as a lie, of the charge that I had just made and which I swear to this House to be accurately based, namely, that the Leader of the Opposition had carried out an attack on the integrity of the courts in New Guinea by alleging racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a personal explanation later I challenged the Leader of the Opposition to deny that he had personally and publicly attacked the integrity of the New Guinea courts by alleging that there was a policy of ‘glaring race <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in the law of the Territory’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are motivated perhaps more than any other people to assert the manhood of the people of New Guinea in the face of a policy of glaring race <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in law, economic opportunity and wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me quote the Leader of the Opposition’s words describing how he carried out what is an undeniable attack on the integrity of the courts by alleging racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any situation, let alone one where racial tension has been inflamed to fever pitch by extremists, those words are a grave attack on the integrity of the courts on the basis of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last Thursday the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden)  added his voice spontaneously to the charges of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in the courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have tabled the Press release from the office of the Leader of the Opposition where, some days after these events, he referred to ‘glaring race <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in law’ in the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of what has transpired today, I believe that he stated this to imply that there was <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in the law in Rabaul. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would respectfully suggest to the honourable member for Fremantle that he should withdraw the imputation of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in the law in New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has taken every opportunity today, as has the honourable member for Fremantle to draw attention to <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in the courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that there was glaring race <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in the law in the Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we should not impose this sort of grossly unfair endurance and perserverance - this sort of self denial and, indeed, <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> - upon people in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When legislation was introduced for a married and single rate pension I moved an amendment on behalf of the Opposition that said it was <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> of the worst type and that there should have been a base rate for all pensioners with people most deserving receiving special assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> between married and single pensioners that this Bill deals with today, the anomaly the Government is trying to remove is one of the many that exist in the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> of the worst kind, anomalies by the thousand and injustices that are multiplied many times have come from this change in making married and single rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has now found that this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> occasionally has to be relieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is do <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, as the honourable member for Lalor said, on ihe part of this Government in favour of the rich against the poor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, if we are to have <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in education, it should be in favour of the underprivileged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been a government of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> - <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against migrants, <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against the farmer, <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against the worker, <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against the pensioner and <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in the matter of defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would now like to discuss a matter which was raised by the honourable member for Wills, that is, the question of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which the Post Office is allowed in this connection is in relation to articles which are blasphemous, indecent, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#debate-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister for External Affairs aware that the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations, instructed by the General Assembly, has addressed letters to all member states requesting them to participate in activities for 1971 which the United Nations has designated International Year for Action to Combat Racism and Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is true that in the recent General Assembly there was a resolution by the United Nations on co-operation to avoid racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose even the Prime Minister has had a member of the Communist Party in his audience on occasions but I should imagine that anybody with any <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> might not attend the right honourable gentleman’s meetings at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope those members on the other side who have legal1 experience - and I believe there are quite a number - will listen intently and appreciate the finesse with which successive South African governments have raised <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> to a fine legislative art. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole structure of South African society is based upon <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> between the different racial groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, I believe that in this way we could avoid the need for <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, as the honourable member for Kingston rightly said, and the bringing about of a lowering of the status of the general practitioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This seems to me to be an extreme <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against those persons who do not live in capital cities and it appears to me that the scheme has only been drawn up to assist only those who live in capital1 cities or other urban areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do so with the object of removing the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against patients who use the services of an ophthalmologist where that service involves the prescription of spectacles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill needs to be amended in the way suggested by the Labor Party to eliminate the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> where spectacles are prescribed and to provide encouragement, first of all, for the medical man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another important point which we should realise is that even though the Government has denied Commonwealth benefits to the patients of either ophthalmologists or optometrists there is still operating a <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against optometrists, particularly in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> does not exist in every State but in New South Wales the major open funds, the Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia and the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia, do provide fund benefits to patients of ophthalmologists but not to patients of optometrists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am very concerned at the statement by the Minister, that even if the Senate’s requests in this respect were effected there would still be financial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against the patients of optometrists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This leads me to hope that in the review of the ancillary services that the Minister has promised to make he will bring to the Parliament a proposal which will grant equal financial benefits without <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> as between the patients of ophthalmologists and optometrists in the matter of refraction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As 1 look around I see many colleagues in the Labor Party who over the years have fought in this House for recognition of the claims of optometrists and to ensure that there is no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> between ophthalmologists and optometrists in the refraction task. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to assure the honourable member that careful consideration is being given to a suitable programme to observe the year 1971 in Australia as International Year for Action to Combat Racism and Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia shares the concern of the United Nations at manifestations of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and intolerance and has frequently made this clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is this concern which led us in the United Nations General Assembly to vote in support of the resolution designating 1971 as International Year for Action to Combat Racism and Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, Australia is a party to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the Convention of 1956 on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery and the UNESCO Convention against <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> in Education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has signed the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> and the question of its ratification is under consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard the honourable member may be interested to know that the United Nations Association of Australia, along with other interested non-governmental associations has set up a National Committee to plan the effective observance of the year, named the Australian Committee to Combat Racism and Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While its programme is not yet finalised, I understand that it will include the dissemination of information about the relevant United Nations documents dealing with racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Equal remuneration without <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> based on sex means ‘(a) that remuneration for the same work at piece-rates shall be calculated on the basis of the same unit of measurement; and (b) that remuneration for work at time-rates shall be the same for the same job’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Government make representations to the New Zealand Government with a view to stopping this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-50-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That in itself creates a great <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against many of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, why does his Office tolerate this form of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-32-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am for moderation; for judgment in context; for an attempted appreciation of real as distinct from false sensitivity; for social responsibility by exercising <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>: for the instructive against the vicarious; in favour of the uplifting rather than the hurtful; and for restricting the portrayal of ultimate degrees of explicit experience in favour of some appeal to the imagination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that things such as race <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, apartheid and some of the propaganda of the Nazi Party are in fact moral issues but I would be the last one to suppress them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular there can be no excuse for this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against migrants, such as those from Malta, who so frequently come to this country in advance of their dependants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710223_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This deliberate <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against the Burdekin River scheme is one example of the mounting charges of bias and inefficiency that are being levelled against the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710225_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Nothing that the Minister has said has suggested that there has not been <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in this matter, when 5 women whom somebody thought they could intimidate along with a lot of others were imprisoned for 14 days for the purpose of intimidating them and when, for some special reason or other - whether it be political or some kind of view that one can go too far - no action was taken against me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems significant, however, that this debate on law and order was introduced during Easter week, which commemorated the life, work and teaching of a leading dissenter, a Man who stood out against racism, violence and <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether the Government is standing over you,  Mr Speaker,  but it is quite obvious that someone is standing over you otherwise you would not be allowing the blatant <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that occurs in this Parliament against the Opposition, particularly at question time when we can see it at its worst. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has moved this motion because it believes rightly - and certainly I would not have seconded the motion unless I believed it - that you,  Mr Speaker,  have time and time again exercised inexcusable bias and <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable member had been here longer I think that he would have known, perhaps better than he conveyed, the fact that there are those of us on this side of the House who have spoken, often with a lot of heat in the atmosphere, against this form of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The cricketers have completely overlooked the day to day change and current climate in South Africa and that firm support for the stand taken by the South African Cricket Association and their cricketers may be just the sort of pressure that needs to be exerted to end racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in cricket and permit South Africa to tour not only Australia but the rest of the cricketing nations of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, it would confront all Australians, and especially those concerned with the administration of sport, with the question of our tacit acceptance of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and political interference in sport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is room within any incomes policy for only one form of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and that is <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in favour not of those sections of the work force which are already glutted with affluence but of those whom affluence has passed by. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the same time, the use by State governments of a subsidy system to assist parents and voluntary organisations to provide pre-school facilities results in the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which characterises the later stages of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On what dates, at what level, by what means and with what results have there been discussions with the Queensland and Western Australian Governments on the laws of their States which do not satisfy the requirements of the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> (Hansard, 6th May 1970, page 1961 and 23rd September 1970, page 1583). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discussions about legislation in Queensland and Western Australia have dealt specifically with provisions which discriminate against Aboriginal Australians rather than generally with laws which do not satisfy the requirements of the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, we have to face the situation posed by the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that we will not be able to carry out our obligations in 1971 which the United Nations General Assembly has designated as International Year for Action to Combat Racism and Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And, as I have stated already, there was the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> and the group of 1966 international convenants on human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If that is not a clear case of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> 1 do not know what is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is this continuing neglect by the Commonwealth Government of the State education system and its continuing concentration on private education - and within that section its <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in favour of the non-Catholic private sector - that are causing this continuing inequality in government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at this Bill now and see where the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> lies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members on the Liberal Party side cannot understand this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, then they have thick skulls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the main reason for this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is the particular background from which honourable members opposite come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the independent schools - and let lis see the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> - what the Government is giving within a period of 4 years is an average of $73.82 for each student. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But compare that amount - and this is where honourable members have to see the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> - with the amount given to government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, there is the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Beazley)  pointed out, if honourable members look at some of the States they will see particular examples of the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, some of which are more flagrant than others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What was the (a) date and (b) tenor of the information which Australia has given to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the programmes and activities undertaken during 1971, which the 1970 General Assembly designated as International Year for Action to Combat Racism and Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-51-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What action has been taken on the Secretary-General’s suggestion that Australia should celebrate the Year by ratifying the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span>, 1966. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-51-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against naturalised persons but it is necessary and proper, as I am sure all honourable members will understand, that inquiries be carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (3)  Dr Eggleston’s  findings cannot, I believe, be said to indicate gross <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against Aborigines in law enforcement in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-37-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some instances of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> on the grounds of race are cited and 1 certainly see these are a matter for concern; but the study also indicates some aspect in which Aborigines find themselves in a favoured position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-37-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In each of these sections, in all parts of the nation, there are 2 groups which suffer particular <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, particular alienation: First the old, the widowed, the sick, the retarded - that enormous group of our fellow citizens who are wholly or mainly dependent on the community: “.nd, the young, the school children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Firstly, this either reeks of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> or of privilege. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think for honourable members on the Government side it would suggest <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against clergymen and others in religious services but from our side we suggest that there is a hint of privilege. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is not a matter of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> then it is a matter of privilege. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the removal of this privilege or <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, whichever it is, will help her to find her true place and her true mission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an odd sort of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> to practise against people who break a Commonwealth law in this way as against people who break other Commonwealth laws, because when the Commonwealth enacted the principal Act it did not take away from people sentenced under that Act their entitlement to remissions for good behaviour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>– My contribution to the consideration of the Treasury estimates deals with the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> to which our society subjects single women of various categories in obtaining finance for housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wanted to make a brief reference to the fact that in this year, the year designated by the United Nations to combat racism and racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, the Government has done virtually nothing through our school system to try to eliminate one of the great blights upon our society- - racism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The supposition that there is <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> between Aborigines and whites in the administration of justice has been tested by several academics and by the Opposition’s Aboriginal Affairs Committee, of which I am a member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>fact remains that there is <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in the payment of the subsidy, and this is an essential part of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One is the one to which I referred concering the need to lift the value of the house which attracts a grant under the home savings grant scheme and the other is the need to eliminate the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which, if this Bill is passed, unjustifiably will operate in respect of people who secure homes from State housing authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to put it on record, even if it has been done before - I think it has - that there is a fundamental problem of discretion, <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and philosophy of education concerning these 2 groups of tertiary institutions - the colleges of advanced education and the universities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> of salary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I  ask the leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard a schedule which sets out the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> at the 2 levels and shows the 1971-72 salary rates for NOPMs and assistants and the differential rates set in 1942. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have drawn migrants from 50 countries, and there is a great range of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> practised between all of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even today, those of us who have been concerned with migrant welfare and have achieved some assistance for family reunions, find that there is <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> continuing in the matter of the issue of visas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, in other cases there is no trouble at all, and this constitutes <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I submit that this Bill follows the 20-year-old pattern of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> between one migrant and another which has been practised by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government wants to discourage migration, all it has to do is to continue to practise some of the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that it is practising at the present time. ] <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I again say to the House that after pursuing a migration programme for 25 years we still have this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in conditions of settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> even in naturalisation, which is undesirable, ft may be said that the law has not been invoked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said before this is <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in its worst form, that we in Australia would be sitting in judgment on the private motives of those who may or may not choose to become naturalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister take immediate action to increase this amount to a reasonable living standard to guarantee to all married pensioners an income that is at least equal to that paid to other pensioners so that there will be no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against the younger wives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has not occurred in this case, but it is a good principle that there is no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As 1 have given an undertaking to restrict my comments on this Bill, I will come quite quickly to the point by saying that the people in the south east of South Australia were most disturbed quite recently, as the Minister for National Development  (Mr Swartz)  knows, because of the fact that South Australia was suffering from some form of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> as a result of a direct reduction in its acreage and the assistance provided for the planting and maintaining of the acreage which had been sought and agreed upon at a conference of the Australian Forestry Council in about March of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for National Development has, in some way, rectified his earlier decision in regard to the matter of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I accept that, but the honourable member’s general comment, if I may say so, sounded as though he was stating that there was severe <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against the small companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a Government which deals with a wage structure on the basis that people who are closest to it will be supported, on the basis of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and - I would tend to think- of hypocrisy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a certain amount of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against the older worker in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-30-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, and the age at which it may be experienced, varies according to occupation, industry, locality and the skill required; it is however not possible to specify its extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-30-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally speaking, semi-skilled and unskilled workers and some categories of executives are likely to suffer most from this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-30-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in order to avoid <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> between patients in the allied fields of optometry and ophthalmology in cases where spectacle lenses are prescribed, the Act specifically excludes the payment of Commonwealth benefits for attendances by medical practitioners which result in the prescription of spectacles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-30-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Works of art are largely exempt from Customs duty and the Government proposes that the sales tax <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against imported works should also be removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-92-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, the situation is aggravated where the depressed are a different racial group, such as negroes or Puerto Ricans, subject to <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, but it is bad without that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The extent of the disadvantage and, indeed, <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> to which this gives rise is illustrated by a table extracted from the statistics of the Department of Labour and National Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not think that any Minister in the House could say that what I have said tonight is not true with regard to <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> between Ministers and private members and senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The deprivation, <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and repression of Aborigines in the Australian society, whether they are fringe dwelling urban residents or living in rural communities, stand as a monument to the selfish and cruel indifference of this wealthy community of ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>ls he able to say whether the legislation of Queensland and Western Australia yet satisfies the requirements of the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> (Hansard, 13th September 1971, page 1220). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On what date and in what terms did Australia give the information to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the programmes and activities undertaken during 1971, which the 1970 General Assembly designated as International Year for action to combat Racism and Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> (Hansard, 13th September 1971, page 1220). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I rise tonight on behalf of a group of young Australians who feel cheated by their country because of an incredible piece of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The problem is definitely a Commonwealth one and there ought to be Commonwealth <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in favour of those States because of their particular disabilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This section of the Bill is part of the whole pattern of this Government’s <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against State schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposed granting of a mere $13.34m to all the State school pupils in Australia is an act of overwhelming <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the continual <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that this Government shows to pupils at government schools that disturbs me most of all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regard it as an act of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against under privileged children like these that while such huge grants are being paid out to schools such as the Methodist Ladies College at Kew, which is receiving over $500,000, and to Xavier Colleges, which are receiving over $250,000 - to children who do not need a cent from the Commonwealth Government - we have these under privileged children attending the White Hills Primary School who are receiving nothing from the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is part of the whole process of flagrant <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against those in need and, in particular, those at state schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What peculiar philosophical values lie behind this wicked sort of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and repression against literally more than 100,000 workers who in no way, in the overwhelming majority of cases, sought to be in this unfortunate position and whose personal tragedy at the moment is a result of all that the Government is doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had more than enough evidence produced in this place and in other places to show the socioeconomic <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which works so oppressively and so terribly against people from low and moderate income earning families that they literally cannot break through the barriers of social and economic <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> into higher education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are prepared to go out to work but this Government has decided to hobble them and as a result we find another area of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and deprivation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have taken a new attitude to nationality so that there is now no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against aliens who have qualified for pensions by residence; the residential qualification period has been reduced from 20 years to 10 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The biggest <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is made against estates that are comprised largely of one asset, usually a farming property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The positive <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in favour of Aborigines through the provision of special scholarships is another area in this vein. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at the new Commonwealth secondary scholarships scheme, the fact that for the first time since 1965 a means test has now been introduced into this scheme is in itself a condemnation of a consistent policy of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in favour of the children from more affluent families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To oppose this principle is to oppose the right of choice and is to stand on the side of restriction and <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say without hesitation that I believe most Australians are strongly opposed to the admission of people from other countries without any exercise of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Labor Party at its Launceston conference last year made a radical departure from its traditional immigration policy by proposing to abolish all forms of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The longstanding bi-partisan policy on immigration has unfortunately been abandoned officially by the Australian Labor Party, and its chief spokesman for many years on immigration matters, the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly),  has been unceremoniously dropped because he does not agree with the proposed removal of all forms of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The essential fact that the Australian people need to realise is that a Labor government would admit migrants from anywhere at all without <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and, therefore, regardless of their ability to be successfully assimilated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my opinion it is a system of massive and wholesale <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that the Minister is supporting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But where people have been able to cater for the needs of their children for years and have built up capital assets, we urge the Government not to make the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> worse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Magistrates have protested, as I have done, but the Government has done nothing to overcome the effects of that decision handed down by the High Court as long ago as 1962. lt is time that people in the Australian Capital Territory ceased to suffer from this type of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Government can cast doubts about the continued operation of, for example, the Economic Wool Producers and when it can continue to practise <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against independent wool buyers, the Opposition takes this as a measure of the Government’s dedication to this particular system of handling wool. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although this legislation applies to a relatively small number of persons,  Mr Speaker,  as approximately 760 Torres Strait Islanders and 40 mainland Aborigi nals served during World War II in the Torres Strait Light Infantry Forces, it is nevertheless important as another move in the Federal Government’s avowed intention to remove the last remnants of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> from the statute books. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As my colleague, the honourable member for Flinders, pointed out, a great proportion of this discriminatory legislation was not based upon <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> on racial grounds originally, but was part of the protective mantle which it was believed necessary to place around the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This state of affairs can only occur because some form of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, not necessarily conscious in the administration of the law in the courts but in the way the police operate and in the way the community accepts its duties in these matters, affects Aboriginal people more than it affects nonAboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I return now to the topic of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To retain the sales tax on contraceptives is an unjustified <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and penalty against Australian women wishing to practice responsible methods of family planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill is designed to make contraceptives cheaper and to remove the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against free choice exercised by women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take it that the charge to be laid against the new Government is that by leaving this tax on it was practising sexual <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in reverse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Real consideration for people as human beings, each with his or her contribution to make to society on a free and equal basis and unhindered by past <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, should be a basic aim in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to know why there is <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to grind that point any further because I wish to refer to another small matter in respect of which, if the government of the day is not very careful, the same error of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against some sections of the industry could be perpetrated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We need to educate the Australian people as far as racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The members of this House, as well as the public of Australia, are entitled to assume that the Prime Minister had this principle in his mind when he spoke to the public during the election campaign and made his promise to all Commonwealth public servants without <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The action of the Government has the most insidious implications for industrial relations in this country, lt is <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> of the worst kind by a government which in other areas preens its feathers of pride under a banner of non-<span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Public servants know that the reason why they are now all to receive an additional week’s leave without <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and without preferring one category of public servant to another is a direct result of the actions of the Opposition Parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the  President  of the Liberal Party in Queensland for the time being he knows, as well as anybody else, how much his Party has suffered from the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in Queensland of electoral boundaries which are gerrymandered in favour of the Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Right through the Minister’s speech he kept making statements such as ‘we should not accept regional <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>’, ‘the principle of substantial equality of representation between electoral divisions was almost eliminated’ and ‘every worthwhile authority supports the case for one vote one value and equality of electorates’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The speech sent a shock wave through the foreign shipping industry and produced reports in the British Press that Australia intended to practise flag <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is true, it would be an extreme example of cargo <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which is completely contrary to the liberal shipping policy which we and the shipowners of Europe and Japan have been advocating.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, I wish to remove any grounds for <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in matters of citizenship and employment against migrants or any section of any migrant community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The guiding principle for the Government in the vitally important matter of the grant of Australian citizenship is that there should not be <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> between different groups of settlers seeking to join the family of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has dedicated itself to enhancing still further the significance and repute of the title Australian citizen’; and in this Bill we ask this House to endorse a charter for the grant of that title, without <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, to all of our settlers who seek it and are worthy of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel there should be no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> between the sexes as far as this concession is concerned and I ask the Government to extend the Bill’s provisions to include these male members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the legislation now stands there is <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against those people who desire to spend their later years overseas rather than in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is sufficient to say that it has had a major role in promoting the acceptance and application of human rights in such areas as abolishing forced labour, promoting freedom of association and removing <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of the other 2 amendments adopted in 1964, one provided for the suspension from participation in the International Labour Conference of any ILO member State which had been found by the United Nations to be flagrantly and persistently pursuing by its legislation a declared policy of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> such as apartheid and the other for the expulsion from the ILO or suspension from the exercise of the rights and privileges of membership of the ILO of any member which the United Nations had suspended from the exercise of the rights and privileges of membership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the Government proposes to ratify them to demonstrate Australia’s firm opposition to all forms of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> such as apartheid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in this Bill there is <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and, I believe that proposed new section 146a is another clause which is designed to destroy arbitration in the way we understand it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But all he has done this evening has been to challenge a legitimate clause that in fact tidies up the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that has existed for quite some time under previous governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such is the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against which we fight, will continue to fight and hopefully will see eliminated from the legislation of this Parliament in this session. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand, the Government alleges a desire to remove <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in various pieces of legislation, particularly the immigration program; on the other hand, it continues legislation, particularly in the immigration area, which in fact perpetuates a number of those provisions which the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Grassby)  could well have removed if he was prepared to take upon himself the burden of undoing any sense of preferment “which is currently enjoyed by British citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition parties believe this to be not so much a matter of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> as a simple fact of the differing bases upon which integration can take place in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it observes not only the machinery of wise and impartial legislative procedures but also the necessary and contingent provisions for an Australian citizenship which, through the evolutionary processes of our history, indicate a course of action free from <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In using the word ‘<span class="highlight">discrimination</span>’ it would be unfair and unjust to accuse ourselves of deliberate prejudice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It conjures up a picture of thousands of would-be British migrants deterred from coming to Australia because they will face this fearful <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He coins emotive phrases such as ‘the family of the nation’, whatever that means, and ‘absence of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>’, with which people in a vague sort of way can identify themselves, but which mean very little unless their consequences are spelled out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I refer to the cessation of advertising in the United Kingdom, the trumpeting abroad of higher standards - mostly phoney - the publicity given to absence of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in selection and admission, and the general impression in Britain that the present Government is anti-British. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In office its supporters consistently applied a principle of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that is perhaps better described as the equality of liberalism, that is, that everyone was equal as long as a select and favoured few were more equal than anyone else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the previous Government <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> did not cease when the immigrant was naturalised; it continued beyond the date of the ceremony. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I must compliment the Minister on the fact that he has taken steps to attack the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that exists in the various States by the establishment of various task forces to look at the problems involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The immigration policy of the Government seeks to rid the nation of the inconsistencies, inequalities and <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that we believe should no longer be allowed to exist when we are seeking to bring people from various countries and to welcome them as citizens in their own right in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is - the Minister has lost sight of this - that the previous Government was not practising <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against nonUnited Kingdom migrants because it applied a different time factor for qualifying for naturalisation to the non-British migrant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such concern would be to find why people are pressured towards abortion; how unwed mothers might have proper care and hospital attention to give natural birth to their children; the procedures of adoption; the provision of government subsidised day care and after school centres for children of working parents; payment of equal tax rebates for dependants, rather than the present system of concessional deductions; increased welfare benefits for deserted and/ or unmarried mothers; removal of legislative <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and positive action to suppress social and commercial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against unwed mothers, de facto wives and illegitimate children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The ratification means that Australia is at last joining with the other responsible members of the international community in affirming opposition to <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment and occupation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It testifies to the Australian Government’s determination to remove <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment and occupation from the Australian scene, not simply by removing cases of blatant <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> but also by taking positive action to promote real equality of opportunity in employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> is an anti-social offence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To practise <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is to practice injustice, intolerance and all of the things against which a Christian nation ought to turn its back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To ignore <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is to ignore injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> in employment and occupation must have an adverse effect on the overall productivity of the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen examples in this Parliament of the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that comes from blind prejudice where certain members of the Parliament have stood in this place and made speeches based upon blind prejudice accusing upright, decent Australians of being enemies of the State and agents of a foreign power, based purely upon political hatred and political prejudice.. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not always easy to determine whether particular action constitutes <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>; it is very difficult indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I anticipate that the pursuit of the policy of non-<span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment and occupation will throw light on such cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This convention is a declaration of intent, a declaration of a government’s policy, in this case in respect to <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> on grounds of politics, religion, race, nationality or sex in employment or in employment opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The convention requires ratifying countries, first to declare a national policy designed to promote, equality of opportunity and treatment in respect of employment and occupation with a view to eliminating any <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in respect thereof, and, secondly, to pursue the policy enunciated in accordance with the range of action specified in the convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the purpose of the convention, <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>’ includes any distinction, exclusion or preference made on the basis of race, colour, sex, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin which has the effect of nullifying or impairing equality of oppportunity or treatment in employment or occupation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to emphasise at the outset that this statement and the ILO convention are concerned only with <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment and occupation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> can occur in a much wider range than simply in the employment field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, this convention is not concerned with these kinds of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any distinction, exclusion or preference in employment based on the inherent requirements of a particular job or special measures of protection or assistance provided for in other ILO conventions or recommendations are not deemed to be <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> within the meaning of this convention No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Measures affecting individuals justifiably suspected of, or engaged in, activities prejudicial to the security of the state are not deemed to be <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> under the convention, provided that the individual concerned shall have the right of appeal to a competent body established in accordance with national practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I want to make it clear that when we talk about <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment we are referring to <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> of that kind where the nation discriminates for its own protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that where <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is practised for the purposes of safeguarding the nation’s security, that <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> has to be justified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its workers education manual, Fighting <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> in Employment and Occupation’, the International Labour Office has pointed out that legislating against <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> does not necessarily remove <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need more than penal sanctions against <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we really need is education - to educate the public to resent and to turn their backs on <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and to reject <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> not because they fear penalties for <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> but because of a deep sense of the injustice which is entailed in <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are, course, long term tasks requiring the creation of a climate in which <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> will wither away by reason of the fact that people in our society will have become enlightened enough to want to see an end to <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, where there is legislation to outlaw <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, the obtaining of convictions can present difficulties and the number of convictions can give the impression that an anti-discriminatory policy is working whereas indicators relating to the relative employment positions of various groups can show at the same time that very little real change is occurring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should that need arise, my Government will not hesitate to legislate to prevent <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing, I am sure, on which the Parliament is united to a man is the elimination of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister for the Media  (Senator Douglas McClelland),  I shall be seeking the support of the media, particularly of newspaper proprietors, in publicising the policy and the avenues open to people who consider they are victims of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> on the basis of sex, action taken in the Commonwealth and State jurisdictions has brought legislation, awards and administrative practices into closer conformity with the convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An examination of the Commonwealth Public Service Act and Regulations and administrative instructions is currently under way with a view to removing any remaining traces of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against women in the Commonwealth Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any instances of sex <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in awards will be taken up with the unions and employers concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sorry to say that there is within this Capital Territory now a <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against women in the engagement of apprentices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There, may be some cases in practice where there is <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> on grounds of political opinion, national extraction or social origin within the terms of the convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may be and there probably are some cases of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in practice, but there is none in theory, or if there are any such cases in theory they will be removed as soon as we are able to identify them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has control over the CES and it will exercise that control to ensure and to guarantee that there is no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> at the level of the Commonwealth Employment Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Committees on <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> in Employment <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will establish machinery at the national and State levels to deal with allegations of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment and occupation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The National Committee on <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> in Employment will be organised on a tripartite basis and comprise an independent  chairman  and other representatives appointed by the Government plus one representative of employers and one of the trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pleasing thing I am able to say is that the Government is going to set the first example by cutting through all forms of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that are based upon a person’s politics, religion, sex, race or nationality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will be appointed because this Convention gives effect to a policy of no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> on the grounds of politics, race, religion, nationality or sex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main functions of the Committee will be to consider allegations of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment referred to it by State committees, to interpret the requirements of the national policy, to promote equality of opportunity in employment and to advise the Government on the necessary action to ensure full compliance with the policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So honourable members from both sides of the Parliament will be able to become involved in this laudable objective of removing completely from this part of the globe <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have already mentioned, the National Committee will be” asked to advise the Government on forms of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> not covered by the ILO Convention itself - for example, <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> on the ground of age, which is considered to require action in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ILO convention is concerned with specific grounds of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment, but it makes provision for extension after consultation with representative employer and worker organisations and with other appropriate bodies, into other areas where abolition of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> might be pursued, for example, <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment on the ground of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government therefore proposes that it will be open to the Committee machinery to receive and investigate cases alleging <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment on grounds beyond those listed in the convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is not content just to eliminate <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> on those grounds specifically referred to in the convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are determined to go beyond the requirements of the convention, to move into areas of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> not mentioned by the convention at all - al] areas of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> no matter upon what ground the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The National Committee will then be in a position to advise the Government on other forms of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment and occupation considered to require action in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One important result of the operation of the National Committee will be that for the very first time it will be possible to make an informed estimate about the extent to which <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment and occupation exists in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether this objective is achieved will depend on whether people bring examples of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment and occupation to the Committee’s attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main function of the State committees will be to consider allegations of breaches of the national policy relating to <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment and occupation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These women are those who are not at present eligible for a widow’s pension under the Social Services Act and who, with their children, have been subject to <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in the level of assistance available to them in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that we aim to end these anomalies, but the important thing about this Bill is that it is a clear demonstration of this Government’s determination to bring an end as quickly as it can to the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that existed against women and, in this case, certain classes of women such as unmarried mothers, deserted wives or wives who have been separated for other reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This form of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, which has been practised in the past, involves undesirable moral overtones. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill will remove such <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I previously mentioned, it will place all supporting mothers with children in the same position as widows with children and will remove the unjustifiable <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which has hitherto existed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I was much impressed earlier today to hear the very sincere words from the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  when he was talking about the International Labour Organisation convention and the need to abolish all kinds of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wanted to say how impressed I was particularly with the point he made that the Government intended to do something about <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the Government putting through the House last week a Bill which contained a most blatant kind of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> on the grounds of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out that it was only last week - I think that I am in order in referring to what happened last week - that the Government passed through the House a Bill which contained the most blatant <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, we have this unhappy, well meaning and sincere Minister coming into the House and making a statement that the Government, amongst other things, intends to abolish all sorts of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against age in relation to employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I wish to make is that by looking to legislation to cover special areas of need there is the extreme danger that in endeavouring to remove <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, as it is put, against particular groups with special needs we will in fact create a massive <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against those who form the normal groupings within the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> between the different family groupings within the community is likely to cause severe difficulty for the future generations of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I see no reason for the blatant <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> between Australian companies and Lloyds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The International Labour Organisation Convention is concerned that the existence of maternity benefits should not result in <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against women in employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 20 March, on the occasion of the inter- national day for the elimination of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, I reaffirmed our intention to ratify the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> as soon as the necessary legislative and other measures could be completed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  stated in the House on Tuesday, we are ratifying a number of other International Labour Organisation conventions as soon as possible, in particular those dealing with equal remuneration - drawn up in 1951 - and with <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in the fields of employment and occupation - drawn up in 1958. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This provision is designed to ensure that a maternity protection scheme should not make the employment of females more expensive for the employer than the employment of males, so giving cause for <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against female labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition does not regard the question of maternity leave solely as an industrial benefit, because to consider the proposition in that way is to introduce an element of positive <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in favour of working women who raise a family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet women’s child bearing functions undoubtedly have served as the basis  of  restrictions and <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill represents a significant step towards the removal of a very grave aspect of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against women in employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The ILO Convention is designed to overcome <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against married women in employment who have families, and this legislation certainly does that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It removes from the Commonwealth Public Service a selective and camouflaged <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which has no place in the Australian way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill is a milestone in my view in the drive against <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It must be gratifying to all those who for so many years have fought and struggled against <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against female employees to know that on this occasion this legislation will pass through this Parliament without opposition and that it will have support, in varying degrees of vigour, from all members on both sides of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would recommend to the Minister that he study the anomaly I have just mentioned and make adjustments because in my opinion there has certainly been a <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against the serviceman’s widow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 25 could be interpreted as imposing <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> between these groups of members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I understand the reverend brother’s comments, he appears to regard the report as discriminating concerning Catholics and he has announced that action will be taken in the High Court of Australia to prevent this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> concerning Catholics, the late Government’s policy, taken at the secondary level which applies to Nudgee College, allowing for $104 per capita a year, to rise by 10 per cent to $114 and then to rise by another 10 per cent to $125 - the rises for the primary level would be similar - in 2 years Catholic schools would have received over $80m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the main reasons for this amendment was to prevent this kind of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another reason for it was to prevent a different kind of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, that is, the charging of different prices to different producers for the use of a pipeline which should be available to all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know where the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> will be because the producers who supported the Liberal Party under a Liberal government will have access to the pipeline - anyone else will be left behind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Are these the only countries in the region where racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> occurs; if not, which other countries in the region practise racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, and does the Government intend making funds available for use in these countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-59-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>103- Maternity Protection (Revised), 1952, is concerned with ensuring that the existence of maternity benefits should not result in <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against women in employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-60-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that there would have been too great a <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in favour of one area if the Aboriginal study grant scheme had been extended to cover the full area of secondary education and special provision for isolated children had not been made at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-39-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is grossly unfair <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> to give some electors more say than others, and the insidious part of it is that because people in similar income groups tend to live in the same sort of area, unequal representation leads inevitably to <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> based on income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps the supreme piece of hypocrisy in the speech by the Leader of the Opposition was the reference to <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against the rural community and his charge that this Government discourages decentralisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I do wish to talk tonight on the basic philosophy - where it is discernible - of the Government on the one hand and on the other hand to talk about that section of the Opposition’s amendment which refers to <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against the rural community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that they protested about was that a few yards away is an area which has tertiary institutions that they would like to attend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Opposition accepted the great principle of wiping <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> but allowed the whole thing to be held up because of a gaggle of words involving a term which is hurtful and which has no legal significance, but which indeed would lend hurt to 1 million people in our country who have not yet applied for citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As recently as this morning the Minister for Education in the New South Wales Government, representing the Minister for Labour and Industry in the New South Wales Government, was heard to complain that my action in freezing petrol prices was some kind of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and that if something was not done about it he would have to take appropriate action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the election undertaking of  Mr Beazley  that all children whether at state or private schools would be equally the concern of the Labor Government, Labor, without a whimper from the Minister for Education, has blindly followed the Karmel recommendation of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against the independent schools in certain classifications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When a case was brought to my attention and it was proved that the person had been refused the opportunity to sit for the entrance examination because he was not a native born Australian I immediately issued instructions that he was to be permitted to sit for the examination and that this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in future should be removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In accordance with the Government’s stated policy I was anxious that the principle of equal pay be implemented so that female employees of the Australian National Airlines Commission were no longer subjected to wage <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> based on sex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-57-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it ever does try to do so, the application of Government pressure or granting of privilege by tariff <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, as is proposed by the Government, would be improper, as we all know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Measures which assist particular industries constitute forms of economic <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which, at least in the short term, can be to considerable advantage to the industries assisted and to the disadvantage to those who pay for the assistance, namely, other industries, consumers, or taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The magnitude of the problem that confronts us, and that confronts us ever more urgently, can be seen nowhere more clearly than in the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> even Australian girls presently suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Labor Party practises a form of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against country people by giving preference to metropolitan areas and to the cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the discussions that I have had with the Minister and from early reports, I have been informed that rather than rural areas receiving less per capita through the Australian Assistance Plan, any <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> will probably be in thenfavour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I am sure that the Minister would agree that laws alone cannot hope to eliminate racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> although they can serve to prevent its most disturbing manifestations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me that we should embark on a program of positive <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in favour of Aborigines in this generation in order that they may have equality in the next generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that such a program can be sold to the Australian people, that it is a reasonable and fair program for us to be putting forward, and that we members of this Parliament, irrespective of our political differences, should unite to convince the Australian people as a whole that it is necessary to spend money at this time, and even more in the future, to bring about positive <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in this generation in order that there may be equality of opportunity in the next. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one looks at the columns of the newspapers one will see reports claiming <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against Aborigines because they are not being allowed to drink as freely as does everybody else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet when one examines the cases one finds usually - not always, but usually - that this claim of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> has been raised against the publican because he has refused to serve Aborigines who have had perhaps a little too much to drink. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government is prepared to provide education in government schools for the children of wealthy parents without any <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> as far as wealth is concerned then why should there be <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in relation to independent schools to which the Government pays only part of the costs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is very important to look at price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and see what the prescription would mean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I come to clause 49, which deals with price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It imposes wide prohibitions on price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the general thrust of the prices <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> provisions runs counter to these anti-inflation, keeppricesdown concepts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, if one has a look at the prices <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> provisions one sees that they will require the supplying of goods on the same terms and conditions to all outlets, with some exceptions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is necessary that we have legislation which covers the significant areas affected by this Bill, namely, monopolisation, exclusive dealing, resale price maintenance, price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, mergers and the field of consumer protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I believe that because of the character of changes involved in this legislation, the failure to provide exemptions in significant areas such as monopolisation, in particular, but in prices <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> too, and the degree to which there is inadequate time provided for us or for members of the business community to scrutinise the legislation, it denies the very competition and stimulus for competition which ostensibly is the purpose for its introduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is banned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of this I am sure: There are some schemes of price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, including confidential discounts, that are advantageous to consumers due, amongst other things, to reduction in price because of the size of the contract and the cost to manufacturers due to economies of scale and, in many cases, the reliability of purchasers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> to retailers and manufacturers of this kind could well be anti-inflationary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have also mentioned the reasons why the clause relating to pricing agreements needs much more careful study and how some types of price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> are of advantage to the consumer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly if the same supplier charges different prices, given the same circumstances in regard to suppliers, there will be <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against those purchasers who purchase the article at a higher level than somebody else in the spectrum of the purchasing group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are of course the other provisions relating to monopolisation in clause 46 and those relating to price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in clause 49. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By contrast, this present legislation will prohibit the following practices: contracts, combinations in conspiracies in restraint of trade, monopolisation, exclusive dealing, resale price maintenance, price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and anti-competitive mergers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Perhaps this is an opportune time to say that in considering these clauses which deal with price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, mergers and certain other practices which are dealt with in the Trade Practices Bill - it of course really could be called the Anti Restrictive Trade Practices Bill - the Government recognises, and I certainly recognise, that the vast majority of businesses in Australia are conducted by extremely well meaning, responsible, civic minded men and women who are wholly devoted to their duties and to the weight of the task which they shoulder in trying to administer their businesses so that they can fit in with changing circumstances in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to clause 49, which imposes wide prohibitions on price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike other practices prohibited by the Bill, there is no provision for authorisations or clearances for price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To establish price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> under clause 49 it will be necessary to show 2 sales by the same seller to 2 different purchasers of goods or services of like grade and quality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As does its United States counterpart, clause 49 prohibits direct or indirect <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> not simply with respect to price but also in relation to the provision of services or facilities in respect of those goods, and the making of payments for services or facilities provided in respect of the goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This includes <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> relating to the manner and dates of delivery, after-sales service, co-operative advertising, promotional allowances and year-end rebates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is prohibited it must be shown that it will or may either substantially lessen competition or tend to result in a person being in a position substantially to control a market for goods and services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enacted in 1936 to tighten and supplement the price-<span class="highlight">discrimination</span> prohibition in Section 2 of the Clayton Act, the RobinsonPatman Act was intended to curb price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that unduly favours national over local sellers and to protect independent merchants from unfair competition from large buyers obtaining the benefits of price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The price- <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> prohibition has discouraged types of price differentials which might have improved competition by lessening the rigidity of oligopoly pricing or by encouraging new entry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I rise at this moment to discuss clause 49 of the Bill, relating to pricing arrangements or what is more familiarly called price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I made it clear when I spoke in this place yesterday that I did not like the provisions  of  sub-clause (4) which relates to restrictive practices - that is, contracts, combinations and conspiracies in restraint of trade, monopolisation, exclusive dealing, resale price maintenance, price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, mergers and matters of a similar kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sub-section (1) does not apply in relation to a <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in relation to prices if - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> makes only reasonable allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale or delivery resulting from the differing methods by which or quantities in which the goods are sold or delivered to the purchasers; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proposed sub-section (3) provides that the onus of proof in showing that sub-section (1) does not apply in relation to <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> by reason of sub-section (2) is on the party asserting that sub-section (1) does not apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It says: the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> makes only reasonable allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale or delivery resulting from the differing methods by which or quantities in which the goods are sold or delivered to the purchasers; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact of businesslife within Australia that price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> does exist on a very wide scale and as one of the previous speakers said, one has only to look at the food industry to see the massive diminution in retailing that has taken place and the tremendous growth in sales per head over the last 20 years in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because I was absent overseas at the time I did not have an opportunity in any of the debates on the various Bills implementing the Government’s Budget decisions to make my protest at what I regard as a most vicious kind of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in which the Government has indulged against the people who live in country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I raise a matter of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against women on the basis that they are women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The circumstances of this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> go back many years and could be laid at the feet of previous Liberal governments as much as at the feet of the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret that so far the Government has not been able to do anything about it, particularly as it has taken some steps forward in other matters of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To allow for <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against citizens on the basis of their wealth, colour, creed or race would outrage the ethical standards of our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only reason for a continuation of the present <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in respect of electoral representation is the cynical wish to obtain -and retain improper minority control of certain electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no room for electoral <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be an indictment of our democratic system of government to allow this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> to continue on the basis of geography. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that racial ill-will is becoming increasingly evident in our society and that this has been caused by financial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in favour of our Aboriginal people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to mention this aspect of the Bill tonight because I maintain that it is the worst example of sectional <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> ever visited on any one industry in the history of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the worst example of sectional <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> ever visited on any single industry by any Treasurer as far as I can tell in the history of the federation of the Australian States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that I would be booed today because this legislation, if I might say so again, on 6 points is the worst bit of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in my memory that has ever been brought to bear on the wine industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me make it clear that I have recently received messages from representatives of the industry that they realise that there was a <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in their favour in the old section 3U, that they recognise that this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> could not continue and that they realise that in no way is .mis removal of the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and the payment of the deferred tax over 5 years to be construed as a substitution for the repealed wine tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact some believe that the removal of this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> will make wine making companies less attractive for takeover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This amendment is one of the steps taken by the Government since coming to office in its endeavour to eliminate possibilities of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and promote opportunity for those women wishing to contribute to the economic prosperity of Australia as members of the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is an act of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and prejudice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to the words of an old friend who told me that the common denominator of religious faiths was the belief in the brotherhood and sisterhood of mankind and that those professing religious affiliations cannot show a better attitude to others than by application of brotherly love in positive <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> on a needs basis to children who must overcome financial, social and even family background problems, among their own, other religions and non-believers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Both  Mr Dunstan  and  Mr Hudson,  on the one side, and the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the honourable member for Richmond  (Mr Anthony),  on the other side, as well as many other people, would agree that <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> between children has got less and less and that the gap has been closed to a greater and greater extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I say also that the Commonwealth accepts the principle of a positive program of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in favour of the Aboriginal people in this generation in order that there might be equal opportunity in the next. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We challenge the Government, in this debate, to demonstrate its overall program to deal with inflation; how powers over prices and incomes would be incorporated into that program; that prices and incomes powers would have only a temporary role within that program; that <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against particular groups in the community and action against individual freedom of choice are not its intention; and to state that it will take a responsible lead by reducing the extravagant growth in public sector spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, as the previous Minister responsible for the operation of the tariff system, I must say that I am critical of the crude way in which this across the board reduction was made, without any <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> being applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the nondiscrimination will act unfairly and unjustly on certain industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, the decision had all the indications that it had been made hastily and crudely, because there was no consideration or <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in respect of special preference tariffs that are provided under the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement and less developed countries which are allowed to bring in certain commodities at a much reduced or concessional rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because I am concerned about allegations, which appear to have some foundation, of police <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against Aboriginals in Redfern, I discussed these reports with  Mr Maddison,  the New South Wales Minister for Justice, on 9 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-45-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, did the Minister discuss such matters as the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> by the Arab Muslims in the North towards the negroid Christians in the South. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Government going to have <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> with Aborigines owning title to minerals, v/hen no one else owns such a title? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the principal amendments to the Public Service is to remove from the Act any discriminatory terms applying as between males and females so that any inferred <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against females by specific reference to them is to be deleted from the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It supports the removal from legislation of this kind of any language which might infer that there is <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, or which not only might infer discrimnation but also would allow in the administration of the Act <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> to come about in practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said that, it is as well to remember that although legislation might not, in its terms, authorise any <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, the way in which a service such as the Public Service is administered could well lead in practice to <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some groups in Australia would like to see not only any language removed which in its terms is discriminatory, but also provisions inserted into an Act of this kind positively preventing <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As long as the Minister in charge of the Bill is prepared to acknowledge to the House that the Government will keep a close watch on all the administrative practices within the Public Service to remove any element of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, it is not necessary - certainly at the moment - to go so far as to put in this positive prohibition against <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in line with its own policy and it hopes that, this having now been achieved in a legislative fashion, it will run right through the Public Service and any element of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> will be eliminated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without moving too far from the subject of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> between males and females, it is as well to remind the House that, within the Public Service, <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> can apply in other directions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not find any legislative prescription dealing with <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against handicapped persons, but people who are so unfortunate as to suffer from conditions such as epilepsy find themselves in a difficult position, not only in private industry but also within the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have written to the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  about this, and I hope the matter can be taken further within the Public Service so that in practice <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, whether against women or handicapped persons of any kind, can be eliminated altogether. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Efforts have been made to eliminate <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, particularly in the field of employ- ment, in the Government’s own service and in employment generally, whether <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> be based on race, colour, sex or any other matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a case of: Yes, we have no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>; yes, we are not prepared to open the doors; yes, we will increase our intake; yes, we will decrease our intake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The tragedy is not only that the Australian Labor Party members of Parliament who are supposed to represent, protect and advance the interests of their electorates have, through neglect or inability, failed; the tragedy is that the policies of this divisive Labor Government introduce a very alarming note of economic and social <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> into the administration of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That would seem to be a <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against the use of these facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the report is correct, I also think that it is a <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against rural areas because in many senses technical colleges are not widely spread throughout rural communities as they are, for example, in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it has been put to me - 1 ask the Minister whether it is true - that there could be some <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against courses conducted by the technical secondary schools in Victoria out of school hours, very often at night, and for which in the past fees have been charged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is so, in areas which have no technical colleges and areas which have no technical training facilities and secondary school facilities are used for this purpose, out of normal school hours, there might be a <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against people attending a technical course at a secondary school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would certainly not be the Minister’s intention to have any element of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The tragedy of the Labor Government’s high interest policy is that specifically it is a policy of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against the small man and the average man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is limiting migrant intake, how does the Government justify the claim that there is no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is therefore <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against assisted passages from Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the past is concerned - it seemed to me that the new initiatives were being questioned - I should like to draw attention to the fact that the initiatives we have taken and the reforms we have made have been designed above all to abolish <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>idea, or wishing to suspend the easy visa system or wishing in fact to bring back <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, is out of touch with the majority of the Australian people and certainly does not represent the bulk of his colleagues because I have representations almost daily on behalf of the constituents of his colleagues, urging tolerance and urging that in fact as much as possible there should be if not an open door a friendly door, a good neighbour policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We abolished all the discriminations in citizenship but we had some extraordinarily interesting cases on file. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> of the worst kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ti was that kind of policy and that kind of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that we set out to abolish, and we have done it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But on behalf of the Government I must say that we have abolished discriminations, but above all we have set out to preserve the aspirations as well as the rights of migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are deliberately setting out to whip up and capitalise upon this latent element within the community - which they believe is still there and which they hope is still there, because if it is not their exercise today will have been wasted - so that they can score some petty political point from the Government in regard to the very humane, sen sible and rational attitude it has taken towards the question of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We propose now to send this mission to all of the countries in the South East Asian region and to South America and the Pacific region and have it lay down the criteria which will need to be followed by the resident tradesmen technical advisers in those countries in order that there will be no semblance of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> between people wishing to come to Australia from those countries and those who come from other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is unfortunate that this afternoon the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  must raise the question of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in such an important discussion as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said earlier that he was abolishing <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without seeking to embarrass the honourable member for Kooyong, I must say 1 am sure that his genuine ideas on non-<span class="highlight">discrimination</span> would be much closer to the Australian Labor Party’s policy than would the attitude and policies of the present Liberal Party spokesman on immigration, the honourable member for Wannon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are simply an extension of the policy that we have stipulated clearly in our platform, namely, the avoidance of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> on any grounds of race or colour of skin or nationality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only since this Government came into office that in the eyes of the world, more particularly in the eyes of the Asiatic nations, Australia has been genuinely regarded as a country which will accept people without <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and as equals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is terribly important for the future of this nation that Australia should be seen to accept these people as equals and not to persist with the sayings of the previous Government in falsely claiming that it had no policy of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course what upsets the Liberals today is that the Government has wiped out this policy of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I further call upon the Opposition in this Parliament and particularly the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden),  who at one time was the minister of State for Immigration, to tell us in this Parliament what their reaction is to the advice that has been given to this Government, to the national Parliament and to the nation by the Queensland Minister for Justice,  Mr Knox  - that we should return to the past, that we should discriminate, that we should repeal all the things that have been done to abolish <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and put it all back again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition has a responsibility to say where he stands, and I have given him a very courteous invitation to express himself because a senior member of the Liberal Party has called for a return to <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, a return to racism and a return to past policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Legislation will be re-introduced to permit Australia to ratify the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span>, which came into force in January 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

    <p>One expects him to be a man of that character because in 1967 he was elected by the people of Corio, an area renowned for sound judgment, discernment and <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In brief, the Bill prohibits the following practices: Contracts, arrangements and understandings in restraint of trade or commerce: monopolisation; exclusive dealing; resale price maintenance; price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>; anticompetitive mergers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The practice of price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is defined in clause 49, which has been redrafted since the earlier Bill was before this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, the clause is now expressly limited to <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that is of magnitude or of a recurring or systematic character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The prohibition of the practice applies where such <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in a market for goods, and the clause makes it clear that that market must be one in which the parties to the discriminatory dealing supply goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have spent a short time discussing the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against one very large section of the Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want now to turn to another form of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which has existed for many years in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I say is that I do not want to see <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is all very well to say that we will have no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>; we will open the doors to all and sundry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But then, of course, sooner or later there will be <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is the Opposition’s policy to allow pensioners to wait more than 12 months for an increase in pensions, that is its business, but we certainly will not tolerate that sort of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet there is a basic contradiction in this clause because it is dealing with price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The opinion that that provision conflicts with the encouragement of competition has been expressed by a number of learned people - by the report of the Attorney-General’s National Committee which studied the anti-trust laws in the United States of America in 1955, by the Neal report more recently in 1969 and by C.

    <p>Why those provisions were never made applicable to the monopolisation provision and the price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> provision in clauses 46 and 49 I cannot understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that the sharp decline in the number of food retailers could not be attributed solely to the restrictive trade practices of suppliers but trade abuses such as boycotting, price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, hidden discounts, hidden co-operative advertising allowances, resale price maintenance and exclusive dealing operated to the severe detriment of independent retailers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are economies of scale to be derived from differing means of delivery of goods, differing destinations and large drops as compared with small drops but these ought not to be used as a screen for price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> as between purchasers of like goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A corporation is prohibited from practising price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and a would-be purchaser is prohibited from attempting to obtain discriminatory prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the provision of services or facilities in respect of the goods; or “ (h) such other acts, things or provisions as may ties provided in respect of the goods, if the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is of such magnitude or is of such a recurring or systematic character that it is likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in a market for goods, being a market in which the corporation supplies, or those persons supply, goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> makes only reasonable allowance for differences in the cost or likely cost of manufacture, distribution, sale or delivery resulting from the differing places to which, methods by which or quantities in which the goods are supplied to the purchasers; or <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is constituted by the doing of an act in good faith to meet a price or benefit offered by a competitor of the supplier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It takes the view that the behaviour of price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is generally, in those circumstances, so much against the public interest that to delete the words ‘directly or indirectly’ and to substitute for them ‘knowingly’ would so weaken the legislation as to be a bad thing for Australian consumers and people seeking to obtain the benefits of the legislation the Government has introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand, if compulsory mobilisation of life insurance funds is intended and if preferential tax concessions are granted to any investment bond scheme, for example, then obviously an additional distortion in the capital market has been created and <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> would occur between borrowers on this market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have done more in relation to pensions than has ever been done before and that, of course, must be our first responsibility, to put real purchasing power into these people’s pockets and not to have them suffer the burden of economic <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> as part of economic recessionary measures which past Liberal-Country Party governments implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government, in a very forthright way, has acted to remove <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> from our laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The legislation that is before us seeks to remove possibly the worst form of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that exists in the Federal electoral laws of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The form of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> to which I refer allows over-representation to exist in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill seeks to remove from our electoral laws this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which has been tolerated and sponsored to a great extent by members from the other side of this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If ever there was a Bill which gave people the opportunity to show where they stood on basic democratic matters and on matters of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, this is it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are merely conservative and devious devices in order to deny adequate representation and to perpetuate <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against citizens who pay their taxes in the same way as everybody else and who live under the same laws as everybody else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that this Bill merely provides for the anticipated normal progress and development of a democratic society- a society which seeks to avoid <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against any section of its people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are absolutely fed up with the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, and I suggest that it should end once and for all here tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet this seems to be the argument which has been put forward by spokesmen for vested interests in the community trying to give some sort of cloak of respectability to this absolutely dreadful inequity and <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against lower income earners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are we in the hands of a government which, for economic reasons, after having created this monopoly of health care, will plunge into <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against certain groups, against services which will be provided and against ancillary services? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the making of payments for services or facilities provided in respect of the goods, if the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is of such magnitude or is of such a recurring or systematic character that it is likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in a market for goods, being a market in which the corporation supplies, or those persons supply, goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Clearly, the representations of the honourable member for Maranoa  (Mr Corbett),  whom I understand was principally responsible for the introduction of the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in favour of country lines, were successful in respect of the area about which he was concerned at the expense of areas such as those represented by me and the honourable member for McPherson  (Mr Robinson),  whom I know would readily agree with me about the problems confronting people in the fringe metropolitan areas in obtaining telephone services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that all the men in this House will be pleased to see that this amending legislation also gets rid of the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> single men have suffered under the previous defence service homes legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At a public meeting of 240 members of the rural community last Friday night certain policies were put forward as being essential to alleviate the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> currently being exercised against country people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> will persist even if it be decided to exempt incomes up to $5000, $7000, $ 10,000, or whatever, from the surcharge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the introduction of our universal health insurance scheme there will be no need for this sense of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and sense of injustice in that the pensioner medical service is available for some retired people but not for all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When that is brought forward the newly elected Legislative Assembly will be able to examine it along with the Trades and Labour Council, and I hope that before the end of the year we will be able to overcome this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against these workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the things that is going to heighten the sense of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in some parents of children at private schools as a result of the Government’s decision is that whereas $150 might in some cases be sufficient to provide for the cost of excursions and books and extras, if parents have only one or two children at a public school, that $150 is going to go like that even if a child attends the cheapest and most frugal independent school in the outer western suburbs of Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Bennelong also talked about <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against handicapped children and the boarding schools that are necessary to accommodate isolated children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Speaker, one of the more objectionable forms of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in the Social Services Act is the treatment accorded de facto wives of unemployment and sickness beneficiaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed henceforth that additional benefit be paid in respect of de facto wives of unemployment and sickness beneficiaries on a basis similar to that for de facto wives of pensioners, thus removing an unfair <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which now exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this could be supported as an interim measure for 2 reasons: Firstly, it is logical in these days of women’s lib that we should not have <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further, there is absolutely no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, in the treatment given, between our own international airline and any other international airline, or between any international airlines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A basic tenet of NEAT is that there is no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> on the grounds of sex, nor is level of income in itself one of the criteria on which an application for training is considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-55-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member mentioned that while he was in China he noticed that there was no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> between first class and second class airline passengers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I was there I observed very closely the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that existed between first class and second class passengers, so much so that I made reference to it to the Chinese who were accompanying the Australian delegation on that occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we do not intend to allow the people who depend on social security benefits to suffer the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and the denial which was the hallmark of LiberalCountry Party administration of this important area of public responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I point out that the honourable member for Mackellar, who talks about the need for a supporting fathers’ allowance, is the man who maintained <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against Class B and Class C widows who were receiving about $2.75 a week less in pension payments than Class A widows when he was Minister for Social Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> was eliminated immediately we assumed office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is gradually being taken away for 2 very definite reasons: first, the reduction in the number of migrants; and second, the broadened policy based on non-<span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and an ability to occupy a position in an industry with little thought for the long term future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government is very proud of what it has managed to achieve in the short time that it has been in office in terms of doing away with <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>- where it has had a measure of success- because <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> exists in a whole range of areas, as the honourable member for Hotham pointed out when he directed his remarks to the ex-nuptial child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But if one takes account of the fact that our young people in the community today are growing up with a far greater degree of honesty than perhaps people of my generation and of older generations had, one sees the reason for the lack of understanding by them of why these forms of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> are allowed to persist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An example is the savage punitive <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in unemployment benefits where a man with a wife and children got much less if he was drawing unemployment benefits than he would have obtained if he was receiving a pension of one form or another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We keep drawing attention to the cost of building, the increasing deposit gap, the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against people who are earning in excess of $ 1 50 a week and up to about $200 a week and the impossibility of that sort of person being able to buy a house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The elimination of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> has been one of the major preoccupations of the international community since the Second World War. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The International Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> (1965), which was signed on behalf of Australia by the then Minister for External Affairs,  Mr Hasluck,  on 13 October 1966, and to which 81 countries have subscribed, requires countries to prohibit racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in all its forms and to guarantee equality before the law without distinction as to race. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The United Nations has supplemented these instruments with numerous resolutions, conferences and programs designed to promote the elimination of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, the Proclamation of Teheran issued by the International Conference on Human Rights in 1968 observed that the implementation of the principle of non-<span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, embodied in the United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration and other instruments, constituted a most urgent task of mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Subsequently, the United Nations designated 1971 as the international Year for Action to Combat Racism and Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span>, and vigorous programs for the year were conducted throughout the world, including Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 6 December 1971, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a resolution urging further ratifications of the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Convention and this resolution was carried by 101 voting in favour (including Australia), none against and five abstentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The program proposed by the United Nations for action on the national level during the decade includes the introduction of legislation, where appropriate, to prevent racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Against this background, it has been the conscious policy of both Liberal and Labor Governments to eliminate all legislation in Australia that contains elements of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is legal <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> still in some Australian States against Aborigines, but my Government has told those States that those laws will be repealed by those States within two years, or if they are not, we will move in and repeal them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In its report of its activities of the year, the Committee stated that during the year it had repeatedly urged the Australian and State governments to repeal all legislation of a discriminatory nature and to take all necessary steps to ratify the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>You may be assured, however, that the Government is continuing its efforts to end all forms of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in Australia. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw honourable members attention to the policy platforms of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party on the issue of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1972 platform of the Labor Party included the proposal that the Australian Parliament should legislate against all forms of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> as part of a program to provide equal rights and opportunities for all persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal platform of the Liberal Party, as approved by the Federal Council in October 1974, includes proposals for the implementation and enforcement of legislation to promote equality of rights between all Australian citizens and to remove any form of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As no action has been taken by the Queensland Government on these matters, provisions were included in the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Bill 1973 to supersede the Queensland law that authorised the management of the property of Aboriginals and Islanders without their consent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to that I suggest that legislation not unlike the Age <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act of the United States of America should be introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Antidiscrimination measures are being introduced to counter racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and every other form of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that the Government or  Mr Grassby  can think of at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We should be contemplating seriously the introduction of anti-<span class="highlight">discrimination</span> laws to stop people from being kept out of a job because of their age? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to make racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> unlawful in Australia and to provide an effective means of combating racial prejudice in our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My predecessor,  Senator Murphy  as he then was, introduced a Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Bill into the Senate for the first time on 2 1 November 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill introduces into Australian law for the first time the obligations contained in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legislation has a vital role to play in the elimination of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and the enactment of this Bill is a fundamental step, a condition precedent, it could be said, that must be taken if Australia is to ratify the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The common law provides few effective remedies against <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in the exercise of human rights, whether it is based on race or colour or on any other grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proscribing of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in legislative form will require legal sanctions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These will also make people more aware of the evils, the undesirable and unsociable consequences of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>- the hurtful consequences of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>- and make them more obvious and conspicuous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is unlawful will make it easier for people to resist social pressures that result in <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In making racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> unlawful, the Bm follows the definition used in the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The BUI Will thus make it unlawful for a person to do an act involving <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which impairs the enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedoms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also deals in detail with racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> so far as it concerns access to places and facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The creation of practical and effective legal remedies against <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is an important objective of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Bill establishes formal administrative machinery for the examination of complaints of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> on a systematic basis and for the settlement of complaints by conciliation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also for this reason recognises that an emphasis on mediation and conciliation is a more satisfactory way of tackling individual instances of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and the tensions that are associated with individual disputes A Commissioner for Community Relations will be established as an independent statutory authority to undertake these tasks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill recognises the importance of developing programs of education and research and other programs to combat racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and to promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among racial and ethnic groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overseas experience has shown that the success of legislation dealing with racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> depends very much on the effectiveness of programs of this kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both governmental and community-based programs to combat racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> are necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Bill, the Commissioner will have the function of conducting and fostering programs of education and research to combat racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, and a Community Relations Council will be established with an advisory role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia will be required by Article 7 of the Convention to conduct programs of this kind to combat racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will provide the basis upon which Australia can comply with the obligations imposed by the Convention on Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill is based on the view that laws proscribing <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> are vital, but not in themselves alone can they be sufficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The educative role is at least as significant and the Bill recognises that there must also be effective and systematic enforcement of rights and the promotion of education and research, if the elimination of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in this country is to be achieved in fact as well as in theory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How can it be a savage invasion of privacy, a violent expression of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, when in fact it extends the right to spend money in respect of candidates from $500 to about $3,000 in the average case? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that the Minister’s claim of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against wives cannot be supported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least one eloquent body on women’s rights, the Women’s Electoral Lobby- an organisation whose members are never slow to find themselves discriminated against- has now stated emphatically that <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> does not exist in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable members I present the first annual report of the National Committee on <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> in Employment and Occupation for the year ended 30 June 1974, entitled: ‘Towards Equal Opportunity in Employment’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that we have to make a stand against <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> between the sexes and therefore we are not prepared to discriminate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should investigate conditions leading to <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against women in education, in the work force and certainly in the credit facilities available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to see some of the moves that this Government has made since coming into office towards eliminating the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against women in the fields of pay and opportunity of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot survive as people and we cannot proudly claim success in the campaign to remove <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against women unless we remember too all other groups similarly disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that does not alter the principle that if the foreign relations of this country are going to be conducted with any consistency and if we are ever going to achieve a situation in which the horrible racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which does occur in South Africa and which is probably a level of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which is duplicated in many countries throuhout the world is ever going to be broken down we are not going to break it down by hermetically sealing off South Africa from the rest of the world, we are not going to break it down by having no contact with the South Africans and we are certainly not going to break it down by preventing cricket contests between South Africa and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two avenues are open: One is to take the matter to the National Committee on <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> in Employment and Occupation; the other is to proceed through the Industrial Court under section 5 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: while the House supports the Bill’s condemnation of acts of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> it is of the opinion that the Bill should be substantially amended because it- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I begin by stating- I trust with some particularity; I hope, further, with some clarity- the Opposition’s attitude to the question of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> before I come to deal with the provisions in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first thing I want to say is this: The Opposition condemns, without the slightest sense of inhibition, racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are opposed unequivocally to racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say with no ambiguity and no equivocation that the Opposition is opposed to racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second matter to which I draw the attention of the House with regard to this Bill is that in the gathering of powers conferred upon this Parliament there is absolutely nothing which gives to this Parliament an explicit right to legislate upon the question of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was my kidney of government that signed the convention dealing with racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>- 1966 circa- and now the Bill is to be ratified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill seeks to outlaw racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and the various manifestations of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, I am seeking to assert the thesis that it is the view of this entire Parliament that racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, one of the disfigurements of the 20th century, should be silenced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill seeks to establish, among other things, tribunals relating to the hearings of matters with respect to racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second part of the Bill deals with the prohibition of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and it sets out what I may describe as the particulars of offences of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are proposing by dint of this Bill that the transgressions with respect to racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> should be solved by erecting an apparatus which would be more suited for a totalitarian country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seeks to put into legislative form the man who comes along and says: ‘Jones has treated so-and-so in a shabby fashion, which infringes Part II of the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Bill.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is unequivocally opposed to racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no doubt that in Australia since the white man arrived there has been a history of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people think that there is no racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the contrary, racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is found at the highest levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> exists everywhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Bill is long overdue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With such bigoted persons as those to whom I referred adorning the Opposition benches, is there any wonder that when they were in government they never introduced a Bill to ratify the International Convention on Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think such action helps the cause to the conclusion which I believe we are all seeking to see achieved, that is, a diminution in any <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> or racial prejudice which obtains in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has introduced the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Bill into this House after 3 Bills on the same subject had been introduced previously in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the words of the Attorney-General  (Mr Enderby)  ‘The purpose of the Bill is to make racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> unlawful in Australia and to provide an effective means of combatting racial prejudice in our country’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are dealing tonight with <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>- not only racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> but <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against people of different nationalities as well as of different races. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be said at the outset that <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> does exist in Australia just as it exists in every country in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we can legitimately divide <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> into 2 broad categories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are discriminatio by intent and <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> by inadvertence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the effect on the victim is manifestly the same, that <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which comes about by inadvertence implies no underlying hostility on the part of the discriminator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is important because if <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> comes about through inadvertence there are no underlying community attitudes which have to be changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not have any research figures to back up my assumption, but I believe that the great bulk of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> within Australia comes about not deliberately but by inadvertence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further matter that should be investigated at the Committee stage is that the Bill carries with it an underlying presumption that all racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is deliberate, which I dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is true that many cases of alleged <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> are unintentional, careless and when they are pointed out, mostly regretted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am merely pointing out that there are many situations where unintentional <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and racial intolerance do take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The objective we all desire- that of overcoming the radical prejudices and discriminations that characterise an uncultured society- must be sought as strenuously through the avenues of education and understanding on a broad general level as it is sought in post-event cases where <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> has actually taken place and the courts have become involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, in relation to unintentional <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, it could well be that this style of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is brought about by little more than a lack of understanding and awareness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One should also note that the Bill covers only racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To concentrate solely on racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is to run the risk of over.simplifying the issue of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> of any kind which cannot and must not be tolerated in any society with pretensions of sophistication. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is readily discernible and more easily demonstrable, but other areas of prejudice should not go unnoticed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could well be established that even though there are many individual cases of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, the Australian people have a basically good-spirited attitude to people from other nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Problems of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> can be engendered by immigration policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the main, whilst many migrants will be able to complain of individual instances of prejudice or <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that they personally have experienced, Australia has developed with their help and effort, largely free from significant racial or cultural prejudice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no doubt that much remains to be done before we can all claim that for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal alike equality of opportunity exists, the prejudice and suspicion have been eliminated and that <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> no longer exists in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is with that background in mind that we should assess the structure and functions of the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Bill as presented to the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That may be something of which people are in favour, but I believe that in the long term <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> of any sort should be overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome any attempt to overcome <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against individuals who are badly done by or disadvantaged, particularly Australia’s Aboriginal population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome the opportunity being provided to fulfil the obligations that Australia has undertaken with the United Nations in relation to the international conventions on the elimination of all forms of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must, however, remain cognisant of the need to avoid appearing to be encroaching upon the freedom of individuals, of the distinction between unintentional and wilful <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and of the need to ensure that the proposed conciliation procedures do not become an opportunity for persecution or character assassination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reiterate that much can be gained by the passage of this Bill, bearing in mind the necessary modifications that we of the Opposition will outline, not only by Australia as a nation showing itself to be mature enough to tackle the problems of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> but also by each individual who has for so long been disadvantaged by the sad deficiencies in our present system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen aspects in the last two or three weeks examples of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against certain people who have made applications for jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1975 we have suddenly found it necessary to introduce legislation to prevent racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, the Bill seeks to ensure that racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> should be proscribed by law and fundamental rights and freedoms, without distinction as to race, should be guaranteed by law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Third, the Bill embodies the principle that there should be established formal administrative machinery to investigate individual instances of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and attempt to achieve a settlement of issues by conciliation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourth, the Bill proposes that there should be fostered- and I believe that this is very important- programs of education and research and other programs to combat racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among racial and ethnic groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All compassionate and sensible people would aspire to end racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> has characterised modern history as man of different ethnic origins has achieved greater mobility enabling him to move rapidly from his own environment to the environments of other ethnic groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is to promote an understanding and an acceptance of the Act by developing and conducting research and educational programs to combat racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, I think there is evidence to show that, if anything, legislation that outlaws racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> has had some effect in countries where it exists, such as in Canada and in the United States of America where the Constitution is being used to outlaw it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is the legislative portion attempting to outlaw acts of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that many honourable members here would be staggered to know how often such <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> occurs, particularly as it affects Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The judgment is made by the person who is guilty of the act of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> not on the basis of the person’s suitability or unsuitability but solely on the basis of the colour of his skin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been plenty of instances of similar <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in which a person’s religion was a barrier to accommodation and employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether I can convince them that they are wrong but I genuinely believe that legislation used with <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, not used with the mailed fist, can be the framework for the next great push in Australia to eliminate racism and racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was at least gracious enough to concede that the sincerity with which members of the Liberal and Country Parties oppose racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is not in dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a difference of opinion in this House on this legislation but it is not a difference of opinion regarding the abhorrence of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>; it is rather a difference of opinion as to the best method by which the problem of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in our society can be handled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to canvass the evidence of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, much of which has already been alluded to during the earlier part of the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that in certain areas of Australia the level and the incidence of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is totally unacceptable and that methods must be devised to eradicate such incidence and to bring down such level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was expressly conceded that the best hope of advancing the field of the elimination of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> was to be found in the processes of conciliation and of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We concede- no, we go further, we totally endorse- the declared intention of this legislation to eliminate forms of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that process of conciliation fails we believe then and only then that there should be a right of civil action available to the person who complains that he or she has been the subject of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that there will be some on the Government side who will immediately say that the Opposition is speaking with 2 voices, that on the one hand we say that we are against racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> but on the other hand we want so to emasculate the Bill that it will not be possible for any effective steps to be taken against the incidence of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our society there is a very strong body of opinion- it was given eloquent expression by the honourable member for Gwydir  (Mr Hunt)that  we will not lessen the incidence of racial tension and racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> by passing fairly stringent laws about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that they have been successful, but I would ask the Government to consider the fact that, while there is a problem of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in Australia, there are significant differences between the problem that we have and the problem experienced in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the great difficulties about this legislation, because it is to have Australia-wide application, is that while there are serious problems in certain areas of Australia there are large areas of Australia where legislation in the form proposed by the Government could be quite inappropriate, for the reasons outlined by the honourable member for Gwydir  (Mr Hunt)  and others, particularly as it is a first go at some kind of legislative proscription of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This removed some anomalies and some sense of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which was felt by many retired people who, although on a pension, were not entitled to those fringe benefits under the previous arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there any <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against this fund? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It concerns me because in my view if this legislation is carried in its present form it will culminate in <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that women’s organisations should be drawing attention to the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against women which will be involved if this Bill is passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me hasten to say here and now that the whole idea behind this Bill- the prevention of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>- must be supported, but the manner in which these clauses have been drafted and the hidden meaning that appears to me to be behind them could spell disaster for many an innocent citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this amendment is to add a further category of persons or bodies to those categories already in clause 15 regarding acts of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in respect of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a commitment of all the major political parties of this country to make unlawful any incidence of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment whether it be on the grounds of race, sex, colour or political or other opinions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly the declared policy of the Opposition parties that <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> on that basis shall be unlawful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think that the addition of the amendment I have moved would catch another category of acts of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know the argument that an act of inciting racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is in some respects more despicable than individual acts of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, because the presence of intent by a person who incites an act of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> can hardly be called in to question whereas the intent of a person who commits an act of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>- certainly some of the acts of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> as they are prescribed in the language of this legislation- may not be quite the same malicious intent as that of the person who incites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, that notwithstanding, the Opposition feels that the penalty or the consequences for inciting an act of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> ought still to be civil matters and that they ought to follow the pattern which the Opposition has endeavoured to establish with its other amendments to the procedures to follow complaints of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognise that there are arguments to the contrary and that where there is a mixture of reasons some might argue that it is sufficient that racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> be a substantial reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Opposition believes that it should be the dominant reason for the doing of the act so that in all the circumstances it is fair to say that the reason why a person acted in a particular way was on the ground of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that quite deservedly it will catch a lot of people but it will also catch some people who have unwittingly committed acts of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We therefore think it is necessary in all the circumstances that there be no doubt that the reason why a person has done an act complained of is by reason of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Implicit in both the contribution from the honourable member for Bennelong  (Mr Howard)  and the honourable member for Moore  (Mr Hyde)  has been the difficulty of the task which is posed by this Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>combating racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and prejudices that lead to racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His role shall be merely to conciliate in an effort to effect settlement of differences which arise out of acts alleged to be acts of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I admit that the question of race <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is something in the hearts and minds of people, and it will not be resolved by law, the fact is that in this country the law is not only an expression as outlined in legislation but also it has to have the look of force or the effect of governmental power behind it before most people will take it seriously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday I spoke as strongly as I could on the fact that most racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in Australia, I believe, comes about through inadvertence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the first time that an Australian government has ever sought to tackle racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in Australia with a law of this sort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one seeks to enact a law for the whole of Australia one has to realise that there are different parts of Australia- different in the sense that racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> might be found to be more extensive in some parts than in others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think one of the Opposition speakers mentioned that in Australia generally racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, where it occurred, was often inadvertent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment provides that a person who is unhappy with the conciliation process, a person who complains that he or she has been a victim of an act of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and feels that nothing has been achieved can go to a civil court and commence proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction for any of the remedies which are set out in clause 26. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, the Opposition very sincerely asks the Government to consider the sort of procedure we have in mind, which admittedly is a softer approach to the treatment of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> than that desired by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand, there is the demand to eliminate acts of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition accepts that any acts which incite racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> ought to be made unlawful, and in fact the earlier sections of this Bill do make that sort of behaviour unlawful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again, this was part of the pattern of amendments put down by the Opposition which believes that acts inciting racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> should attract the same types of consequences as those acts themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Government means to maintain the special <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in favour of our Aboriginal people which is contained in some of the legislation, some of which I introduced into the House, and some of which subsequently has been introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one is a greater admirer of the common law and the ways in which it can achieve progress than I am but it has been a dismal failure in terms of trying to give relief where racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone has conceded that this is a serious attempt to do something about racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can express the sense of outrage that a civilised society feels about <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> of this sort where it exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament may by any law with respect to trade or commerce forbid, as to railways, any preference or <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> by any State, or by any authority constituted under a State, if such preference or <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is undue and unreasonable, or unjust to any State; due regard being had to the financial responsibilities incurred by any State in connection with the construction and maintenance of its railways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But no preference or <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> shall, within the meaning of this section, be taken to be undue and unreasonable, or unjust to any State, unless so adjudged by the InterState Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation, seen against the background of the racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> Bills and other legislation which the Government has introduced or proposes to introduce, is designed to remove from the Queensland legislation certain discriminatory laws or certain discriminatory sections of existing laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaving that aside, I state that we have all accepted in this House the fact that we need positive programs of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in favour of the Aboriginal and Island people to overcome the disabilities from which they suffer in order that perhaps a generation from now all people in this country may be equal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have earlier this day addressed ourselves to the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Bill which flowed from a resolution of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> from the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The chief feature of that Bill, as honourable members will recall, and its pertinence to the matter now being discussed is that by the introduction of penalties we will be able to achieve what understanding and reason have not been able to achieve previously, notwithstanding that the resolution, as evidenced in the Schedule attached to the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Bill, insists that we are to promote and encourage universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, we swing back to features of the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Bill which would necessitate that if one of these Aborigines from a reserve or, to a lesser extent, one of these Torres Strait Islanders who ethnically seem to demonstrate an all-round greater ability in their original state should apply for a position in this outside world and find that because of lack of opportunity he is not up to the job and preference is given to a non-Aboriginal, immediately, under the terms of the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Bill, an employer who decides to exercise that preference is liable because of all the reasons advanced for <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against the appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, from that time an element of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> was introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us accept that there is <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and that much of the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> directed against the Aboriginal race is most unfortunate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great misfortune suffered by Aborigines has been magnified greatly by the level of inflation which has made <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> a lot more real in some areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here again are the elements of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a second element in relation to <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and it is a new one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is patently and obviously a fundamental reason for the feelings of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that arise in the hearts of some people in certain areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I complete my remarks by saying that I hope this Government will do everything it possibly can to remove <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, I would like it to try to get at one of the main root causes of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which unfortunately in some areas of Australia today is getting greater and not less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we are here tonight to remove the discriminatory provisions that remain in the Queensland legislation, and to make provisions with respect to the people of the Aboriginal race of Australia and the race to which the Torres Strait Islanders belong for the purpose of preventing <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in certain respects against those peoples under the laws of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are those areas of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I saw this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in the Torres Strait myself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could reach the situation where, because of some <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> on a personal basis, an Aboriginal or Islander would not be allowed to rejoin his family or his friends in a reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not only in this area of workers’ compensation that this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against Western Australia appears but also under social services benefits legislation in relation to fees payable to a chiropractor and fees payable to a chiropractor under the repatriation services legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One very practical example of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is that fees payable to medical practitioners are available for tax deduction but those payable to registered chiropractors in Western Australia are not tax deductible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should hope that the Minister in charge of that legislation and of other fields that I have referred to will have a look at this matter to see that that <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is ended as quickly as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nowhere in technical and further education is <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in access more evident than in skilled training for apprentices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last week I participated in the debate on the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Bill- a Bill I had wanted to see introduced long before I came to this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The articles which have been appearing in the ‘Australian Financial Review’ in relation to section 49 deal with price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will be aware that section 49 of the Act prohibits <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> as follows:  . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the making of payments for services or facilities provided in respect of the goods, if the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is of such magnitude Or is of such a recurring or systematic character that it is likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in a market for goods, being a market in which the corporation supplies, or those persons supply, goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arising out of that inquiry one of several things could happen: The inquiry could disclose that there was no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> or that unfair preference was not being given to one individual or group as against another individual or group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750421_reps_29_hor94/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament may by any law with respect to trade or commerce forbid, as to railways, any preference or <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> by any State, or by any authority constituted under a State, if such preference or <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is undue or unreasonable, or unjust to any State; due regard being had to the financial responsibilities incurred by any State in connexion with the construction and maintenance of its railways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750421_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But no preference or <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> shall, within the meaning of this section, be taken to be undue and unreasonable,  or unjust to any State, unless so adjudged by the Inter-State Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750421_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They must laugh at the piety of the Government’s anti-<span class="highlight">discrimination</span> statements because they know that they suffer from massive <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One way in which such a possibility could be minimised is to enable anyone with a legitimate interest in industrial relations I use that phrase in the way it is used in the Queensland courses- to be given the opportunity to participate in the courses without <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will kill the whole mass of people who have served this government without any <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> of corrupted or not corrupted people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This burden can be overcome in 2 ways: Either by the mother, irrespective of the ages of her children, going to work, or by significant tax reforms so that the current <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against the single income family is removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Union suggested a number of measures to remove some of the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Darling Downs says, the mother who stays at home must now bear the brunt of the financial and social hardships because her deprived children suffer <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> among their peers in their schools and in their social activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both administrations in South Vietnam, i.e., the PRG and the Saigon administration are to be treated without any <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> whatsoever either both will participate in the Conference or neither will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of getting it cleaned up and removing some of the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would change the requirements dealing with marriage, which are a positive <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against single people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the new scheme there is no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against single people as there is under the old scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman was putting forward that there should be <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against tenderers on the grounds that they either derive from or have some association with companies overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other matter I refer to is the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in the application of the National Employment and Training scheme (NEAT). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these times, when the generosity of the Government is excelled only by the number of unemployed in this country I ask why <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against people wishing to enter theological colleges should be practised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as they are on the Government side, and in great numbers, and have been told of these happenings, if they are true men at least they should have the character or the courage to stand up in their Party room and demand the removal of this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government does not consider that this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> can be justified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing which the Corporation will do is to reform in the following areas: Firstly, the formulation of a series of standard policy clauses to protect policy holders from deception, fraud and exploitation; secondly, examine the need if any for the abolition of arbitration clauses; thirdly, the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against females in sickness and accident policies and in employment opportunities; fourthly, adequate laws are badly needed to govern the standard, training and monitoring of both brokers and agents; and, fifthly, simply, accurate advertising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regard this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> as indefensible and very much in need of correction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will the Minister investigate why this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> was shown by the A.B.C., particularly when it is realised the Leader of the Opposition had released during that period the Opposition’s 12 point aid plan for Indochina. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Renton, that insurance employees who are even lukewarm in their opposition to the Corporation may face <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in the form of nonpromotion? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is obviously sexist based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one breaks it down on a work class basis, one finds that 4 out of 5 manual workers are not covered by any form of superannuation and that more than 9 out of 10 females employed in manual work are not covered- further evidence of the sexist basis of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in superannuation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia should plan to avoid any conflicts or frictions arising from racial or national differences and while doing so should be liberal in admission to Australia of people of any race or nationality who desire to come, especially those who are suffering from reprisals or <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in some other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not reflecting on my friend, the honourable member for Maranoa  (Mr Corbett),  but I think this is <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against the people in McPherson, the majority of whom vote Liberal, while the majority of people in Maranoa choose to vote National Country Party of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the honourable member talked about <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in the latter part of his remarks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We shall also eliminate the restriction on single persons because we believe there is strong <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against women and men who are unmarried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Lewis’s advertisement also refers to <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against psychiatric patients. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, to the extent that there is <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, it rests solely with the New South Wales Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to such matters as the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Bill, the attempts to gerrymander the electorate in order to sustain an authoritarian system of democracy; and various Constitution Bills that were knocked back by the Senate and the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is there this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other provisions illustrate this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the policy of the Australian Government to apply the principles incorporated in the Declaration on Territorial Asylum without <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, and hence without regard to the identity of the regime alleged to be persecuting, or likely to persecute, an applicant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-48-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Apart from <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against people in private hospitals this adds to the confusion of health funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer next to the claim by the Government that it will end <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in hospitals with the introduction of Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that the Government is doing is introducing <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in respect of those people who believe that they have a right as Australians in a free society to be treated by their own doctor and to have the hospital ward accommodation of their preference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at the claim of no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does this situation relate to the suggestion that the Government is ending <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in hospitals in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is just introducing a new form of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate has amended the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Bill in a number of respects, the most important of which are as follows: First, the power vested in the Commissioner for Community Relations to commence legal proceedings where he is unable to effect a settlement by conciliation has been removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government would also have much preferred the inclusion of the offences relating to incitment and the promotion of racial hatred so that the requirements of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> could have been followed more closely in Australian law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation will declare racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> unlawful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commissioner will have power to engage in programs of education and research to combat racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It applies to a broader range of acts based on racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> than is found in overseas legislation and contains fewer exceptions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that the amendments will have the effect of replacing the blunt instrument of the Bill as originally presented with a process of conciliation and education which we believe will do a great deal more effectively to reduce the incidence of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in Australia than would have been the case with the Bill in its original form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt, as the AttorneyGeneral  (Mr Enderby)  said, that a common ground exists between the Government and the Opposition concerning the abhorrence of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was for that reason, and not because of any reluctance to oppose racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, that the Opposition moved the amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problems of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and racial tensions in the United Kingdom are vastly different from problems of the same nature in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no posturing about the Opposition’s attitude towards the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my colleague has stressed, we are as much against racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> as anybody in the land but we believe that the original proposals put forward by the Government were perhaps a little bit too enthusiastic in some areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it is a step forward in bringing about a realisation within the total Australian society that racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, which I firmly believe is largely inadvertent, should not be countenanced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of people are opposed to a racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is true to say that the basic solution to <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> lies with individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I personally believe that a racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> Act, as this will now become, embodying as it does the aspirations of our society for attitudes that ought to exist between individuals in the society will, in the end, promote the proper relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I and others like me are concerned about is that ultimately this Government intends to use the Superior Court to rule on all manner of matters such as <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, environment, children, women, motor accidents, the stock exchange, corporations and trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian and State Parliaments to pass Acts providing for human rights and civil liberties, and to take all possible legislative and administrative action and judicial proceedings to prevent infringement of such rights and liberties and in particular to prevent <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> on the grounds of colour, race, sex, creed or politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He says a Liberal government will use example, encouragement and specific legislation to rid our country of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So he is going to use legislation to rid our country of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>; that is apparently to ensure that there are not the great gaps between privilege in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He rejects any moves to deal with <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> yet he says in the same speech, 2 paragraphs away, that there will be specific legislation to rid our country of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people believe that this Budget should not have seen expenditure cuts almost across the board, that in fact there should have been more positive <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in favour of lower income groups, that huge allocations should have gone to deserted mothers and fathers, child endowment, public housing, child care and education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> on grounds of race, nationality, politics, creed or sex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause (f) of the policy which provides that there shall be no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> on grounds of race, nationality, politics, creed or sex lies at the heart of Australia’s immigration policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This offensive requirement, this denial of basic rights, this shameful example of political <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, is the personal responsibility of the Prime Minister, and he alone demanded it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision represents <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against every migrant in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hasten to say that in years this Government has done more to guarantee an end to <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against migrants than our friends did in the 23 years of their Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When did the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar),  who began this debate or the second  speaker  from the Opposition side, the right honourable member for Bruce, bring in any legislation or any administrative machinery to prevent <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against migrants or, for that matter, anybody else? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can he inform the House of any United Nations conventions against <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> between the sexes, particularly as they apply to sport? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-For some time there have been United Nations conventions dealing with <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was left to my Government to ratify the 1953 Convention on the Political Rights of Women, the 1951 International Labour Organisation Equal Remuneration Convention and the 1958 <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> (Employment and Occupation) Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret to say that none of these conventions dealt with <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in sport as regards sportswomen or sportsmen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not aware of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> on the grounds of sex being raised in any United Nations forum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not sure what the Government could do with respect to any <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which is shown against  Dr Malcolm  Colston when he seeks re-employment in the Queensland Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This in itself is <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against pensioners in the 65 years to 75 years group because they were already means tested and taxed as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and differential treatment and it is a betrayal of a promise by a senior spokesman for the then Labor Party Opposition that Labor would not take away any benefits already enjoyed by the blind people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister avoids the fact that the NEAT scheme contains other forms of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which the Government is pledged to remove. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition- and quite apart from what may appear to be sloganeering- we have a great deal of detail worked out in terms of major programs for the creation of equal opportunities for work, for removing <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment, but not by legislation tampering with decisions of the Commission, for training and retraining and for union and management training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The media is fond of turning the searchlight of truth or at least illumination on those matters where it can be suggested that there is some waste of public expenditure or where it seems that there has been some <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in favour of Aboriginal people which seems to be unfair vis-a-vis other Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are many people who, when looking at a program put forward in regard to Aboriginal affairs, are inclined to say: ‘This is <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in favour of the Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aborigines do not want this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people in those townships say that this is <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in favour of Aboriginal children, but if one goes to the places where some of the adults live and where some of these Aboriginal children live one finds very often that they live on a reserve and, notwithstanding the large amounts of money that have been devoted to Aboriginal housing, they may still live in a corrugated iron shed or shanty without electric light or a water supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable gentlemen know, in recent times we have enacted legislation directed at the Queensland scene designed to eliminate <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take this opportunity of saying that legislation is operative and I hope that wherever opportunities present themselves the Aboriginal people Will avail themselves of that legislation and seek legal advice, perhaps from my Department, in order to sweep away any of the relics of the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that remains in that State, as indeed it does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been great <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and this must be corrected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I bring to his attention the fact that there is <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> on the Commonwealth Railways with regard to people who have their goods consigned to Alice Springs for on-forwarding by other than the Government contract carrier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Government will give an assurance that such a remission will be provided so that <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against certain producers, particularly those in the granite belt, might be eliminated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They claim that it would cause some <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, some inequity or uneven incidence in the application of the levy to the States, particularly with respect to Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have accepted the principle of positive <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in favour of these people, and I applaud that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have laid down certain rules governing that positive discriminationbroad rules, the rule of law in general. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this area of positive <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> alone it is necessary not only that these people feel that they are being fairly treated but also it is essential that they succeed in what they are doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite obvious that the Liberal governments in those States have a conscious policy of cruel <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against people who pay rent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is the work the Government has done to combat <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The work of inquiry, investigation and research which lead up to the establishment of the committees against <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment represent yet another major step forward in opening up a true equality of opportunity for all the women of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the field of the protection of human rights, the Parliament will recall that very important law, the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act, which established a Commissioner for Community Relations and also a Community Relations Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>An earlier draft of the proposals was considered by standing committee ‘B’ of the Australian constitutional convention early in 1974 and the bill subsequently revised to reflect the principal concern of the Committee, which was that there should be no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> between States in any designation by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How does it expect to meet the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which would clearly arise between States as a result of some States imposing higher surtaxes on taxpayers than applies in other States? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should there be that <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> between States? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among those valuable initiatives was the decision to appoint a committee of the Immigration Advisory Council to inquire into and report upon the extent of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and exploitation of migrants, with particular emphasis on their use of community resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interim report the Committee put particular emphasis on several aspects of community concern for migrants and highlighted several areas in which <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> was practised against migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The National Committee on <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> in Employment and Occupation has endorsed this specific recommendation and has expressed the view that where any nationality requirement is justified it should be restricted to that of Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I believe that it should be regarded by the Government as a matter of urgency that this one area of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against newly arrived migrants should be eliminated by the positive action of the Government to give equal employment opportunities in the Public Service to all Australian citizens regardless of their ability to handle effectively the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, there should be no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> on the basis of income or ability to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Australian Legal Aid Office, the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act and the many other initiatives of this Government will help to right the imbalance, help to ensure that the migrant communities can play an active role in Australian society with a minimum of social cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In-line with its general policy towards apartheid, the Australian Government firmly opposes racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in sport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With flexible approach offered to teachers in the innovations program there was some hope that positive <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> could be provided, particularly in disadvantaged schools in areas of high migrant concentrations where the children have not mastered the language adequately, where they have very few facilities at home and very little encouragement, because of the difficult situation with their parents, to make the best of their education opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am certain that the Minister, coming from a country electorate in Victoria and being conscious of the fact that sometimes whether we like it or not air travel is the only convenient method of connection, not only for business but for pleasure, will appreciate the point I make that there should be no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> between air passengers from one State and from another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For this Government, the basic condition will be South Africa’s willingness and ability to move away from racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in sport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another effect is the price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> section of the Act which was borrowed by the former Government from a similar United States statute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I recently lodged with the Consul at the Russian Embassy a petition containing 2500 signatures protesting at the harsh treatment meted out to Soviet Jewry, decrying the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against them and highlighting the consistent refusal of the Russian authorities to grant exit visas to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There had been too much neglect, too much moralising, stigmatisation and <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against these women, and too much of that was to the disadvantage of the innocent infants who were their offspring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There would be few honest men in this Parliament who could not enumerate great numbers of incidents where women in this category had come into their offices and detailed not only the harrowing circumstances under which they tried to make ends meet and raise their children but also the problems of maintaining equipoise with their personality, maintaining their self-respect, maintaining their sanity in the light of the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that existed in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> between A, B and C class widows was removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Chairman  of the Committee has been associated with a company that has been embroiled in several investigations of the Trade Practices Commission, involving massive price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> designed to destroy competition by selling goods below cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister gives no reason for singling out price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and mergers as 2 particular areas for the attention of the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact is, as he points out, that if the pre- 1959 fund, which has not yet been distributed, is wound up, there is a real risk of unfair <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against these older superannuees who are already getting what I consider to be a bad deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So in this respect there should be no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> either for  or  against Aboriginals and those who misbehave in a way which upsets their neighbours should be treated in the same way as those whites who we know do misbehave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable members might note that the Government has flagged for the Committee’s special attention 2 practices -mergers and price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But what of proceedings under the proposed new section 163a relating to practices for which clearance is not available, such as monopolisation, exclusive dealing under subsections 47 (3) and 47 (4) resale price maintenance and price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that there was no public demand in the case of the price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> section of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In all these welfare issues that have been debated in the Parliament, I have noted that he has derived great hilarity from the concern expressed by the members of the Opposition about people affected by the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and the unfairness of the burden which has been imposed on these sections of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, two of the cuts cast serious doubts on Australia’s status as a signatory to the United Nations International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cut in the appropriation for ‘Committees on <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> in Employment’ is almost half of the total-$24,000 out of $50,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I referred earlier to the fact that the cuts cast serious doubts on whether we have fulfilled our obligations under the United Nations International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We became party to this Convention with the passing of the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act of 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the new Government has effectively prevented the full expression of the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act and has rendered impossible one of the key provisions of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Government is not prepared to allow the Council to be established, I ask the Minister whether he will give effect to article 14 ( 1 ) of the Schedule of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That article provides that a State Party may at any time declare that it recognises the competence of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> to receive and consider communications from individuals or groups of individuals within its jurisdiction claiming to be victims of a violation by that State Party of any of the rights set forth in the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>States Parties undertake to adopt immediate and effective measures particularly in the fields of teaching, education, culture and information with a view to combating prejudices which lead to racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and to promoting understanding, tolerance and friendship among nations and racial or ethnical groups, as well as to propagating the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But before I outline the ways in which the cuts have had this effect, it is worth noting the views of the present Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs when the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act was debated on 8 April 1975 and he was speaking for the then Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He talked on 2 distinct types of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister referred to deliberate and inadvertent <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the effect on the victim is manifestly the same, that <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which comes about by inadvertence implies no underlying hostility on the part of the discriminator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is important because if <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> comes about through inadvertence there are no underlying community attitudes which have to be changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This cut has totally negated the educational component of the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3 ) If so, is the reason for the present <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> due to the existence of the disease of bluetongue in the United States which is highly dangerous to the cattle and sheep population of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since bluetongue is now reported to be present in Canada <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> no longer exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, it was <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in favour of winemakers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have gone on public record as saying that if the decision making had been in my hands at the time the alteration was made, I would have gone ahead with this alteration because it was, I believed, a <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which should not continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this is to be the situation, all right; there is only one way to describe it- it is a naked and blatant exercise in Liberal <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> for those people who put the Government in power and to whose tune the Government dances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I share completely the view- I am sure all members of the Government share it- that there should be no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against individuals, I think it is fair to say that there would be very few cases in which individuals who did not have the benefit of some corporate existence would want or qualify for this type of assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the office of Commissioner for Community Relations was established it was envisaged that it would play a vital role in the community, that it would deal not only with specific complaints of instances of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> but also would actively initiate programs to rid our country of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and racist attitudes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How does he justify the sort of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that arises for a very large number of people in the community who, if they wish to stay within the basic Medibank cover for public ward and medical insurance and take out optionally hospital insurance for intermediate ward cover, have to pay a lot more in total than if they were to go directly to a private fund, including Medibank Private if it is the person ‘s whim to take out that sort of cover? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If our objective is not merely to express moral indignation but also to help end the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, we have to consider how best this will be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For this Government, the basic condition will be South Africa’s willingness and ability to move away from racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in sport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In line with its general attitude towards the apartheid system, the Australian Government firmly opposes racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in sport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The maintenance of sporting contacts with South Africa will depend on that country’s willingness and ability to move away from racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in sport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is opposed to racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in sport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if our objective is not merely to express moral indigation but to help end the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, we have to consider how this will best be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> based on the sex of the parent requiring assistance is against the spirit of this fundamental and quite proper principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I would be very much opposed to any <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have recently said publicly that the Department is now working on ways and means by which we can convert those unemployment benefits into work money, not in any sense of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> or to deny to Aboriginals their entitlement to unemployment benefit but to see that the money which would otherwise go into a community in that way and not be put to work is in fact put to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will recall that last year the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act was passed by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things that it did most significantly was to abolish <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> based, amongst other things, on ethnic origins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The creation of that Office and the appointment of this man to that position raised significantly the hopes of ethnic communities that positive <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in their favour may at last take place and that a good deal of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that took place so unfairly in the community would be stopped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately the parties now occupying the Treasury bench have a long history of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against persons with left wing leanings, as previous speakers have said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No similar <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is practised against persons with extreme right wing political leanings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  referred to the recommendation of the Trade Practices Review Committee to abolish section 49 of the Trade Practices Act which deals with price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs who is responsible for administering the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to stress that the Commissioner for Community Relations is a statutory officer with certain functions set down in the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act of 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government supports the principles on which the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act of 1975 is based and adheres firmly to the International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> which Australia has ratified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I made this suggestion simply because the booklet was not of a standard which in my view would bring any credit to the Commissioner or further the cause of those of us in the community who are opposed to racism and to <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> based on racism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All honourable gentlemen are opposed to racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and the Government is committed to its elimination in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say that there was absolutely no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> for or against these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of all, this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in favour of the advantaged and the inference that the manual worker is in some way inferior is surely poor justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not now labour the point about the great inequalities and the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> applying to the Aboriginal people for all sorts of reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to mention finally the National Committee on <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> in Employment and Occupation which was formed following ratification of Convention No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This country is bound by the Convention to monitor <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment and occupation, it having ratified that Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Committee, and the State committees, are quite crucial in ensuring that there is no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment and occupation but they have not been able to meet for months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that all the complaints about <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment and occupation are coming in to the staff of the committees but they cannot be processed by the committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Government really believes what it said in its policy speech last year about how it believed in abolishing <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment and occupation, the Minister should immediately appoint a  chairman  of those committees and allow them to meet and reduce the massive backlog. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member also referred to <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government wants to end that vicious <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which Labor inflicted on country people and begin to heal the breach between city and country people which was fostered by the Labor Party in its 3 years of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To date, no answer has been provided why this apparent <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is to be exercised against serving members of the defence forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it true that one of the reasons for the veto on publication of the booklet is ‘an unnecessary expense considering that <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is an everyday event’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What is this Government’s stance in relation to <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against ethnic groups in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Essentially, as I mentioned in the House some time ago, I did not believe that the standard of the booklet or the collection of material was such as to enhance any attitudes against <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in the community if it was publicly made available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why should there be such <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against large families? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of the House to a scurrilous advertisement that appeared in the  Australian  of 29 October last, which sets out the most infamous resolution ever passed by the United Nations, whereby Zionism was said to foster the growth of racism and racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Racism and racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, including apartheid, are abhorrent not only to the people of Israel but also to all other peoples of the world who similarly cherish democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Never let it be forgotten that the Jews themselves are the classic victims of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and that their martyrs over the centuries run into tens of millions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, this smacks of paternalism and <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and portends perhaps the Minister’s fears of the articulate and educated Aborigines of the south influencing their northern brothers and sisters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the honourable member for the Northern Territory that if <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is justified I believe in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course I believe in <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in a compensatory way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aborigines at the present time need a great deal of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in their favour, and we did establish a system of compensatory education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not speaking about adverse determination or accusing anybody of adverse <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Is there <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against a particular age group of blind pensioners relative to other blind pensioners which has been brought about by actions of the former Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the growing discontent amongst petrol resellers in various parts of the country at the effect of wholesale price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, particularly in favour of ACTU-Solo, can the Minister give any indication as to when the Government will announce its decision on the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Petroleum? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-This evening I wish to raise a matter of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless there is a strong case for continuing to pursue the elimination of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against women where it exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It would seem to me that the Australian Defence Force continues to be a bastion of such <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a sequel, it was necessary for the Australian Government to introduce the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act which was assented to on 19 June 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social, economic, ecological and environmental deterioration which are exemplified at the national and international levels by inequalities in living conditions, social segregation, racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, acute unemployment, illiteracy, disease and poverty, the breakdown of social relationships and traditional cultural values and the increasing degradation of life-supporting resources of air, water and land; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-41-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These policies must facilitate the rapid and continuous improvement in the quality of life of all people, beginning with the satisfaction of the basic needs of food, shelter, clean water, employment, health, education, training, social security without any <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, ideology, national or social origin or other cause, in a frame of freedom, dignity and social justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-41-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore the duty of all people and Governments to join the struggle against any form of colonialism, foreign aggression and occupation, domination, apartheid and all forms of racism and racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> referred to in the resolutions as adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-41-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Government has accepted the recommendation of the review committee that the prohibition of price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> be repealed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Pursuant to section 46 of the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act 1975 I present the first annual report of the Commissioner for Community Relations for the year ended 30 June 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One particular matter to which I would like to refer relates to the assertion that there is a widespread breach of our international obligations under the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The initiative to combat racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> was taken by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you reject a man on the grounds of his politics or his religion, he may change them to please you, but if you reject him on the ground of race in any way whatsoever by <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in regard to his land rights, there is no way in the world he can change his race to please you. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would  like to make it quite clear that there is absolutely no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> at all against the appointment to positions of permanent head of what might be normally termed outsiders in the sense that they are not members of the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that my colleague the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Antony Whitlam)  will be speaking on the question of price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> later in the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has said clearly that it accepts the recommendations of the review committee that price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and other matters need to be given a proper scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential that we look, in the Australian context, in which we have such an oligopolistic market structure, at price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is, I believe, a general acceptance that it has been useful in the area of price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in the United States, but it certainly took, at the least, 25 to 30 years for that to come about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In looking at that time frame we have to look at the difficulties caused by an intervening war and at the post-war period when it was not relied on and when it was not a matter of great litigation, but I believe the essential justification for legislation on price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> remains as valid today as it was in the United States 40 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at the basis upon which the Government has decided to repeal section 49 which deals with price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> brings price flexibility, and that price flexibility is at the very heart of competitive behaviour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Put shortly, it is that a law controlling price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> will have a long term influence on structural trends that will be pro-competitive by ensuring survival of small business interests that can continue to compete. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This whole area of competition law with which we are dealing is not something in which we will see rapid changes in market place behaviour since the Trade Practices Act came into operation, both in 1974 and certain provisions such as that relating to price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what the Commission said in relation to price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Trade Practices Commission refers particularly to the fact that it believes that in making its recommendations on the question of price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> the Swanson Committee very likely went beyond its term of reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would like to turn to section 49 of the Actthe price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> section- which this legislation proposes to repeal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> provisions were put into this Act as a result of the Murphy legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have discussed tonight in considerable detail the sections dealing with prices <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to commend to all honourable members the reading of section 7 of the Swanson Committee report, which deals with price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The section dealing with price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> has been the subject of considerable discussion because of the involvement and the conflict of that section with the operations of the Prices Justification Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members would care to look at an article by  Mr Charles  Filgate Giles appearing at page 555 of the  Australian Law Journal  of November 1976 they will see, under the heading ‘Price <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span>- s. 49’, some more detailed reference to the United States experience, which has been very similar to our own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While that prospect of uncertainty exists, is it any wonder that the price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> clauses have not been effective? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I can say that in moving around my electorate- the large city of Parramatta- I have not had people coming up to me and saying: ‘Ruddock, you have to maintain those price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> clauses because to do otherwise would have a disastrous effect upon small business’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to honourable members opposite that the provisions of section 49, which they are emasculating, section 47- there the Government is not putting in the provisions required for price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> particularly in the retail section of the oil industry- and section 73A, the link provisions, are .being ignored because the Government will be obliged to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They believe that section 49 has in many instances prevented unfair <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and that it has been a major factor in the survival of small business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Royal Commission on Petroleum recommended after an extensive study of petroleum marketing and a close observation of the effects of price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that section 49 be strengthened along the lines of the Clayton Act in the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is of the view- I agree with this -that price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> arrangements worked to inhibit price flexibility and did not encourage competition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the pretence of freedom, we know that there are inside the borders of the Soviet Union <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, persecution and worse of all who profess any religion because, as Lenin said, communism is necessarily militant atheism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some of these people in the Soviet Union had had the tremendous courage to face martyrdom to face deprivation, to face <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, to face persecution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has produced discriminations over a wide field of human endeavour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is social <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, whether it is the efforts of the people of Bega or of Kempsey to prevent houses being built in their street, or, the one more difficult to locate, the employer who refuses to give an Aborigine a job, or the proprietor of a hotel or a boarding house who finds he has no vacancies left if applied for by an Aborigine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The expenditure on schools and general public services in these townships is nowhere near comparable to the expenditure on an equivalent white township, and economic <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> resulting from the poverty of their general surroundings and their own personal position, and there is one which I recall at the moment negative <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So many favourite beliefs have to be challenged, so many people have to be confronted vigorously on the question of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> of all sons that it will only be with the full support of all Parliaments, both parties and both Houses, that this will be attacked effectively in the next few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was natural that in our first period of government we set about restoring women’s rights, and removing <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in all its social, economic or legal forms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognised that for women to take their place in society on a basis of dignity and equality it was necessary to remove <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and, beyond that, to meet the needs of women in overcoming handicaps. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We established committees on <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment and an inquiry into the educational needs of women and girls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And undoubtedly there is more to be done in removing <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and promoting sexual equality, but it is time we turned our minds to broader issues as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever party they belong to it is time the Government looked to safeguarding the ordinary rights of students to hold political opinions of their own without fear of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> at the academic level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act 1975 states clearly that the Commissioner should throw out a complaint if he believes the complaint to be quite frivolous, vexatious or not made in good faith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we do not want this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> not only in funding but also in courses so that we have a third grade tier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By condoning this situation we are condoning a far more subtle, and in the long term effects, a more drastic form of racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> than anything known or practised hitherto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 25 November 1975 the Women’s Trade Union Commission and the Queensland Women’s Trade Union Committee received grants of $40,000 and $500 respectively from the International Women’s Year allocation, to undertake activities which would assist women unionists and would work towards the elimination of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against women in trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-43-16">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does this apply to pensioners as well as to others and is it a form of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in that when a person is required to occupy a bed other than a standard bed he is denied cover even up to the standard rate although he may be prepared to pay the difference between standard and intermediate or standard and private ward cost? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government itself has seen fit to ignore recommendations of that Committee in respect of other matters, such as mergers and price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Again, price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> under section 49, which has been retained by the legislation before us, and perhaps there will be some further reference to it, is still contrary to the recommendation of the Swanson Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the second reading debate, such as it was, that we were permitted on the December legislative proposals that the Minister introduced, it fell to the Labor side of this House to champion the interests of small business and successfully to defend the repeal of section 49 in relation to price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other material which will be deleted by the amendment might raise accidental inferences leading to an undesirable narrow interpretation -for example, that conduct did not include price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposition that in some way the total effect of this legislation represents <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against the trade union movement to the advantage of private enterprise in Australian society is, in my view, a wholly unfounded proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Like the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Antony Whitlam),  I think it is of great significance that this Government, which came to power on the wave of being generous to business, understanding business and representing business, has been forced to retain section 49, dealing with price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, at the behest, perseverence and representation of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Royal Commission report ranges over such diverse things as the development of the Island’s economy, whether cows and horses should be able to continue to roam across it, whether duty free status should be continued, whether there should be a law library on the Island; matrimonial causes, legal aid, a prison and law enforcement, racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, unionism and social services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As my allegations subsequently have been proved correct and no malice was intended on my part, does my experience testify to the fact that the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act can in some instances work against the freedom and rights of everyone? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The activities of the Government from the time it took office have been directed towards getting rid of Grassby or, alternatively, of getting the Office into an area where he would be suppressed so that he could not carry out his role of providing protection against racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has decided to remove an element of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> existing in relation to the eligibility of married women to receive sickness benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>111.- <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> (Employment and Occupation) 1958- is in such a form that it is not mandatory for a ratifying country to enact legislation in order to implement its provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, when Australia ratified this Convention in 1973, the National and State Employment <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Committees were established shortly thereafter, on a nonlegislative basis, in order to give effect to its provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member will also recall, this nonlegislative approach which was adopted by the Commonwealth Government in 1973, had the support of all the State governments,’ as well as of the national employers’ organisations and the trade union movement, and the tripartite membership of the Employment <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Committees reflected this tripartite support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, because these Employment <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Committees were established by the Commonwealth, with the full support of all the States, there were no problems involving jurisdiction and no demarcation disputes, while the participation of non-governmental representatives, nominated by the employers and the unions, enabled the Committees to resolve complaints of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which they received in a way which may not have been possible if their membership had been restricted to the governmental level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, since the Employment <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Committees were established, the Commonwealth has enacted its Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act 1975 and, in addition, the New South Wales Anti-<span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act 1977, the Victorian Equal Opportunity Act 1977, as well as the South Australian Sex <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act 1975 and Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act 1976, have been adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As all this legislation applies, inter alia, to the proscription of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in respect of employment and occupation, at least on the grounds of race and sex, it does provide some legislative basis for giving effect to some of the provision of ILO Convention No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ill, even in respect of race and sex, has given rise to questions of jurisdiction, to demarcation disputes, as well as to problems of duplication, overlap and uncertainty, as well as to confusion among the Australian community, and very real difficulties from the point of view of the Employment <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances, and given these recent legislative developments, I am examining the desirability of discussion with the States, as well as with the national employers’ organisations and the trade union movement (through the National Labour Consultative Council), on the possibility of providing a legislative basis for the National and State Employment <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I agreed that the subdivision in toto should be removed, but to remove half of it on the basis that it is known which way the people will vote is a blatant <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against the people in that electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to mention one other form of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, and that is the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against persons who are Commonwealth citizens, in particular citizens from Cyprus and Malta and who therefore, under our laws, are not only entitled to vote after they have resided in Australia for six months but are compelled to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been no action that this House knows of to enforce the laws passed in 1975 against <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> generally and, in particular, against <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in the Queensland law concerning Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975 we gave Aborigines rights over their properties, we ended wage <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, we established their rights to have legal representation in courts and we ended the odious permanent entry system onto reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The authority of that legislation, in conjunction with the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act of 1975, the Aboriginal Land Fund Act and the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act of 1976 gave the Government, if those authorities were taken up, a great deal of clout in its relations with the Queensland Government in the matter of Aboriginal welfare and rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Between them the laws I have quoted would have removed odious <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> from the laws, regulations and by-laws in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless one has actually seen and experienced the situation, it would be hard to credit that, in 1976, such oppression could be practised by the Queensland Government and its agencies against a section of its citizens; or that a State Government daily flouts two Federal laws, namely the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) and the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government were thoroughly genuine in this matter it would have long ago taken up the authority available to it under the legislation that we introduced to eliminate racial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in all of its odious, oppressive and insidious forms in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer, for instance, to the Aboriginal Land Fund Act, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act, the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act, the Aboriginal Lands and Associations Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of that, not only was the authority under the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act not adopted but also the evidence is that the Minister prevented it from being adopted in defence of Aboriginal rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your letter of 7 December 1977 was also the first advice to me that the Commission had taken relevant legal advice in respect of the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By itself that might not have seemed so significant, although it is certainly worrying; but in association with other matters for which the Minister has been responsible, clearly what he was seeking to do was to impose a fiscal <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, a fiscal prohibition, on the Land Fund Commission which was very rightly seeking to exercise the authority available to it to protect the rights of Aboriginals in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seeks to strike down the very abuses of human rights, of which the honourable gentleman spoke- the discriminatory actions and legislation of the Queensland Governmentbut it does it in such a way that it creates a right in the hands of any Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander in Queensland to protect himself against <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> by reason of the provisions of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are still disadvantages, disabilities and <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> for farmers in this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he try to prevent such <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against persons who have generally given good service to a government authority? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It ill behoves one of the wealthiest men in this Parliament to be responsible for the imposition of such <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and disadvantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that were done, there would be no need for such mean and penny-pinching <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> to be imposed upon the more needy and the more deprived people in the community- the most trusting people in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I advance the thought to the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  and the Minister for Construction  (Mr McLeay)  who are at the table, that when considering forward planning for good, decent living for all Australian people, they bear in mind that under the arrangements for the payment of family allowances and tertiary assistance there is some <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against big families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the unemployment beneficiary in some sense morally less worthy, or is this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> one further piece of evidence to support this dole bludger syndrome which tends to lie behind much of the rhetoric of the Government on this question? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government regard this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> as being of minimal impact, as in a sense affecting only young people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that the explanation for this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>) If not, will he make inquiries to see whether some employers and companies follow a policy of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and will he take action to abolish the practice if this is the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There have been occasional such reports from the Commonwealth Employment Service, as well as complaints to the National and/or State Committees on <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> in Employment and Occupation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The latter Committees have been established as part of the machinery to give effect to Australia’s ratification of ILO Convention No.111 - <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> (Employment and Occupation), 1958. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (3) With its ratification (in 1 973) of this ILO Convention, the Government is committed to eliminating <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in employment and occupation on the grounds of, inter alia, race or national extraction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Employment <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Committees are available to receive, and take remedial action on, complaints of employment <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> on such grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, such persons who reside in New South Wales or South Australia, may seek redress under the provisions of the NSW Anti-<span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act 1977, or the SA Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act 1 976, respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister posed a series of rhetorical questions but he did not explain away the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> he exhibited last Saturday in the raid on the headquarters of ACTU Jetset Travel Service Pty Ltd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any reasonable assessment of what happened last Saturday, it was a blundering, unnecessary performance and a clear exercise of political <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> by a Minister who pleads the rights of democracy but practices the principles of partiality in support of those he wishes to advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The only other area of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and opposition to lower air fares has been against Australian Student Travel Service Pty Ltd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only construction that we can place upon the events of last Saturday are as follows: Firstly, they reveal the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> of this Government against the trade union movement and any efforts it makes to advantage the needs of its members; secondly, they reveal the Government’s inability to administer in an evenhanded, proper and responsible way its obligations under bilateral arrangements with nations and with the International Air Transport Association; and, thirdly, they reveal the Government’s blind and continuing opposition to the introduction of lower air fares. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is determined to introduce low cost air fares that will benefit all Australians without <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, including all members of unions and all people who are not in unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the Minister for Transport had an opportunity to consider a report today that Qantas Airways Ltd is applying <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against Jewish passengers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against Australian citizens of a particular faith, and that is of concern to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we are going to find this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in one industry vis-a-vis another or one company vis-a-vis another within an industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only are we going to find the initial <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> based on pork barrelling, as there will be in this new set up; we are also going to find that <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> compounded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is fundamental to our own Constitution that no person shall be subjected to penalties or to any form of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> based on his religious beliefs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our major responsibility is to ensure that people of Jewish faith in Australia and elsewhere are free to practise their faith without being subjected to any forms of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> or hindrance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It would seem to me that this Dutch born person who, incidently, as soon as he could became an Australian citizen, is having a form of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> practised against him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second factor in the Labor Party’s manpower policy would be the use of selective employment promotion measures to alleviate labour market disabilities of groups disadvantaged by poverty, <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, inadequate training and obsolete skills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a stark <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against the underprivileged, even in the private sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to clear the confusion amongst some ethnic groups concerning the implementation of the new air fare policy, will the Minister clarify whether there will be some <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against ethnic groups? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One dealt with a private dinner; three dealt with the economy; one was on export controls; one was on mineral exports; one- only one- was on the very serious question of employment; and one was on the question of Jewish <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> by Qantas Airways Ltd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The objectives specified in the Bill are as follows: The first objective is to prevent <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> in the payment of medical benefits for medical services rendered on or after 1 November 1978 which is, in the opinion of the Minister for Health, improper <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This term is defined in clause 3 of the Bill and, briefly, is <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> relating to the following matters: Chronic illness; age of the patient; limitation on the level of medical benefits payable under organisations’ rules because of the frequency of the rendering of professional services or the aggregate of amounts of benefits payable; or any other ground prescribed by regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To safeguard continued membership for those persons who, for example, are chronically ill persons, clause 5 of the Bill provides a new section  73BFB,  which entitles a person who believes cancellation of his membership to the medical benefits fund constitutes an ‘improper <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>’ against him to request the Minister to direct the organisation concerned to reinstate the person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where the Minister is of the opinion that improper <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> has occurred the Minister can direct the organisation concerned to reinstate the person without loss of entitlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the amendment prevents the Minister from approving a change to organisations’ rules which provides for a new table of benefits, or alters or affects contributors or benefits, if in the opinion of the Minister the change brings about an ‘improper <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final amendment in the Bill is in clause 9, under new section 73BFB, where provision is made for the Minister to make a direction to a registered organisation to reinstate a contributor whose membership has been cancelled on grounds of improper <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against any one country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781121_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would mean repealing legislation to protect individuals against <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> and persecution and repealing legislation to protect essential services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A very small increase in charges in other areas would obviate what I think is quite a severe <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against people who can least afford it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The raid can be described only as one of blatant political <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this legislation, improper <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> by a fund against a contributor must now be brought to the Minister’s attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the new rules on improper <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, is the Minister going to insist that the fund insure people over 65 years of age? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a contributor’s membership has been cancelled, the contributor, believing there to have been improper <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, can ask the Minister to direct the fund concerned to reinstate him without loss of entitlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One important point of the legislation is that the Minister will have the power to prevent <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against hospital benefits contributors where the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>, on or after 1 May, is related to the question of whether, having regard to a person’s medical condition, hospitalisation is necessary, desirable or appropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise again that that was not the only fund which introduced the limits to which we now refer as ‘unfair <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘improper <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>’ means a <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that is related to all or any of the following matters: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, they are defined as being people against whom improper <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is practised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand, we have the problem of maintaining equity for old people and the ability for them to obtain health care, whether it be hospital or medical, without <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second reading speech which details or explains the amendments contained in this BUI makes four points: Firstly, protection from improper <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> by a fund to cover chronic illness, age, limitation on frequency of services, etc; secondly, to protect subscribers in both the pre- and post- 1 November situation from rule changes made by medical benefit organisations; thirdly, protection from reduction below the 75 per cent level by any fund; fourthly, protection from arbitrary reclassification of the patient from a hospital to a nursing home situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> which the present Bill will not remove. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other aspects of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> have arisen out of the present scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely this is <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> is also possible because doctors have the capacity to bulk bill but they are not required to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Discrimination</span>, in whatever form, has no place in this land, and I hope that all parties in this Parliament agree on that point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation is directed specifically towards preventing or reducing <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against medical benefit contributors in relation to the scope and level of benefits available to them for medical services rendered on or before 1 November 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Bill, improper <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is clearly defined as relating to chronic diseases or other illnesses of a particular kind, age, maximum benefit rules applied by organisations, and any other prescribed matter referred to and decided upon by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said to the Director of the Hospitals Contribution Fund in a telegram I sent to him, I and my colleagues in this Parliament will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that legislative action is initiated to prevent <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> of that type. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to his point relating to improper <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> as it might apply to benefits for procedures, such as cosmetic surgery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> must, in the opinion of the Minister, be improper <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will only be when all the children in all of the schools in Australia receive the same teaching about our multicultural society and when all of them are given access to a second language that we will be able to say that <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> has been abolished and everyone is being given the same opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is blatant <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> by this Government, but such <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> is not unusual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-58-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a sectional government, a government of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-58-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first matter I raise is the failure of the Minister to mention- I do not know whether the report mentions it- the continuing <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against Australian Citizen Military Forces servicemen who served in theatres of war within Australia in the Second World War and who are excluded from benefits under this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-58-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>) Is he able to say whether this reversal of a decision was due to advice from Australian Government sources; if so, was any political <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> exercised and, in particular, was (a) the Australian Government a party to restriction of movement to representatives of minorities seeking international support for removal of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> or for compensation for dispossession of indigenes by later settlers in Australia and (b) an Aboriginal subject to refusal of a visa on account of unsubstantiated political objections raised by a State Government, but not applied in the case of non-Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-41-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 10 September 1976 I issued a Press release entitled ‘Minister Acts on Alleged <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> in Queensland’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, on the face of it, there does appear to be a breach of the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will be taking the matter up with the Attorney-General for him to communicate with the Commissioner for Community Relations to see whether there has been a breach of the Racial <span class="highlight">Discrimination</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In making its decision, the Government will take account of the views and comments it has received as well as significant changes in the market situation where widespread discounting with allegations of price <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> has been replaced by supply difficulties and virtual cessation of discounting at the retail level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some two weeks ago, I raised in this House the question of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against women who, having been widowed - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, you just have a look and see the <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> that exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me mention some further anomalies highlighted by this legislation which suggest either government neglect or deliberate <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> or, in respect of the honourable member for Darling Downs  (Mr McVeigh),  simply ignorance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No justification is offered for this <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against the unemployed and none can be offered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But these Bills do more than simply tolerate the existing welfare <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against the unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, there has been that kind of <span class="highlight">discrimination</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After three years of waiting, with all these promises that the anomalies were going to be put right, we get this gross <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against Commonwealth employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am surprised that honourable members on the other side are prepared to accept this gross <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against Commonwealth employees, but I suppose that it is consistent with the Government’s attitude towards workers generally, towards public servants and towards Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Have the examinations for admission to the Public Service been modified in any way, bearing in mind that these examinations have been an effective barrier against immigrants and their children from non-Commonwealth countries entering the Public Service, in addition to the legal <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The presentation of a petition containing almost 30,000 signatures to the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  last week indicates their grave dissatisfaction at what is effectively <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> against 700,000 Australians of Italian origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result of this admittedly narrow space in which the populations recognise that they can make their own choices, political <span class="highlight">discrimination</span> applied in a more effective way fulfils its stabilising function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
