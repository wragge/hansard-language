    <p>During the period November 1973 to December 1975 the Minister for Housing and Construction was responsible for (the then) Commonwealth Hostels Ltd- which activities included accommodation services to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-17">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As with all other countries from which <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are taken, Yugoslavia has a legitimate and reasonable interest in the number and occupational categories of those moving to immigration countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is not unique to the Yugoslav Agreement and in any event the benefits of this provision of the National Service Act are applicable to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from all countries irrespective of a migration agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through it we have benefited greatly by an infusion of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> of excellent personal quality and who are sought after by employers because of their industry and aptitudes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Agreement is intended to confirm Yugoslavia as a continuing source of such <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now a good thing to see the Government, with the urge to get <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and with certain avenues drying up, looking further afield and not discriminating politically against the countries from which <span class="highlight">migrants</span> might come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that respect this is a desirable approach and undoubtedly from what we have seen of the types of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have come to Australia these new <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will be very desirable citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, we oppose it and I hope it will not be long before the Government is able, by legislation, to remove that provision completely from the Agreement because we believe that that Act should be repealed as it applies to conscription not only of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> but also of Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With horizons still to be reached and with greater difficulty in getting <span class="highlight">migrants</span> this Agreement represents a step which, in this age, had to be taken and it is one of which we approve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the statistics which the honourable member for Maribyrnong has given are correct, the immigration programme of which we boast - and rightly so - is a concealed failure because apparently there are more abortions than there are people coming into this country, after deducting the number of departing <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, one of Australia’s early claims to attract <span class="highlight">migrants</span> was that we were proud of our tradition of every man having the opportunity of having his own home on his separate block of land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have come to Western Australia for a new start in life who have waited for more than 4 years for accommodation by the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is time we considered the enormous cost of bringing <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These figures may sound high but they are not when we compare them with the cost of bringing <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been a government of discrimination - discrimination against <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, discrimination against the farmer, discrimination against the worker, discrimination against the pensioner and discrimination in the matter of defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally I ask the Minister: If he is not in a position to answer my question now, will he initiate an immediate investigation into the allegations made in the newspaper article, and, at the same time, make available to all immigration officers, regardless of where they  aTe  stationed, up to date copies of the major Australian industrial awards in order that intending <span class="highlight">migrants</span> can be advised correctly as to the Australian wages and working conditions applicable to their particular trade or calling? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, 1 would say to the honourable gentleman that, naturally, in a migrant intake of approximately 180,000 this year, from time to time circumstances will arise where allegations are made concerning misinterpretation in information given to prospective <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to say to the honourable genleman by way of observation that in all of these cases investigations are carried out immediately because my Department is at all times concerned that it should reflect to prospective <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia a very accurate picture of circumstances here whether by way of social or industrial conditions and awards relative to wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that on this subject a two page leaflet is available to British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who claim plumbing qualifications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are refused recognition or a licence as a tradesman upon arrival in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are adequate precautions taken in overseas posts to ensure that intending <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with trade skills fully understand the requirements for recognition as tradesmen in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In October 1969 the National Health Act was amended to provide free health insurance for persons receiving unemployment and sickness benefits, for families with weekly incomes not exeeding $39 and for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> during their first 2 months in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Immigration: Is it a fact that immigrants are encouraged to believe that naturalisation will entitle them to all the privileges of Australian citizenship? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he aware of the concern and resentment of elderly <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who find that, in spite of naturalisation, they are denied the age pension because they have not been in Australia for 10 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly could not agree with the statement or inference made by the honourable gentleman that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are treated or regarded as second class citizens in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Good heavens, we are told that 175,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are going to arrive in Australia this year and approximately one-third of them are likely to leave the ship in the west and look for houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have kept closely in touch with the immigration programme over the years, not only because of my own interest as the Minister who first planned the post-war intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> but more particularly because of its vital importance to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, recent newspaper reports of a change in policy in respect of the transport of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia has concerned me somewhat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, experience has shown that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who travel by sea are better conditioned to take up a new life in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, 3 or 4 weeks on a ship provided opportunity, so far as <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Europe are concerned, to teach them English and to inform both British and European passengers more fully on such important matters as government in all its phases, education, housing, hostels, employment and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourthly, I under stand that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who arrive by sea are more contented and settle down to a new life more readily than those who travel by air, because these people are one day in London, for example, and the next day in Albury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, there is evidence to show that the returnee rate is higher amongst air <span class="highlight">migrants</span> than amongst those who come by sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also the important responsibility of placing <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in employment commensurate with their qualifications can be much better performed in the case of sea <span class="highlight">migrants</span> than those who travel by air. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They receive much earlier advice if <span class="highlight">migrants</span> travel by sea and they are therefore better able to make the necessary arrangements for their reception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another vital point in favour of sea transportation is that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> can bring their personal effects and household belongings with them on the ship without charge,, whereas if they come by air they are substantially limited in the amount of baggage they can take with them and any excess has to be paid by the Government or the migrant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the Sitmar Line which has transported <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration from the early 1950s and under official contract to the Australian Government since 1956. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no business connection with the Sitmar -Line but, like many honourable members on both sides of the House who have informed themselves as to the service being provided for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia by this company, I have a full appreciation of the excellent way in which it has carried out its contracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well known that with the advent of the Sitmar Line in 1956 stabilisation of the rates being charged to us by the shipping companies which carried <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia was brought about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> had complete access to all parts of its vessels; this did not obtain previously with other lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must also be remembered that Sitmar’s contribution to Australia has not been limited to the intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I would like to say to the Minister that this company has carried 250,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia without the loss of one life and to the satisfaction of those travelling on its vessels as well as to the contractual authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the excellent service given by this company is recognised by the Minister and that within any limita- tions that might apply he will see that everything possible is done to retain its ships on the Australia run, which could be in doubt if its services for the transportation of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is not utilised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The background to this issue is that in response to an invitation by the Government on 19th August last to all passenger shipping lines operating from Europe to Australia, 3 companies offered to carry <span class="highlight">migrants</span> by sea on a contract basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Up to 15,000 berths are to be taken at the option of the Commonwealth for the carriage of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Britain and northern Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that the arrangements are confined to Britain and northern Europe and do not include the transport of the balance of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from elsewhere in Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remainder of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> under the assisted passage programme from the northern area will be carried by Qantas Airways Ltd and/ or its associates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new transport arrangements negotiated by the Government involve a change of contractor and an increased use of air movement for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new contractor, Chandris Line, has carried <span class="highlight">migrants</span> for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the end of the 3-year period of the contract it is expected that approximately 75% of assisted passage <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will travel by air from Britain and northern Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already the movement of assisted passage <span class="highlight">migrants</span> by air has grown to half the total assisted passage programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This represents an exercise of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>’ own preference for this form of travel and is consistent with world trends in general passenger movement by air. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is underlined by the fact that programmes from areas where <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are now moved totally by air have not suffered in any way because of this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that, contrary to the impression given by the right honourable member for Melbourne, it is not valid to say that 50% of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> elect to travel by sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of commitments to sea berths it has been necessary in the past to have this proportion of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> travel by sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right honourable member for Melbourne also mentioned the advantage to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Europe travelling by sea in that there is provision for training in the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As 85% to 90% of the people carried under this contract are from Britain there is little weight in the argument that by curtailing sea travel we are denying <span class="highlight">migrants</span> the opportunity to learn English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no evidence at all available to me or to my Department which suggests that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> settle down more readily if they travel by sea, or that there is a greater returnee rate amongst <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who travel by air. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not see that the voluntary organisations or other people nominating <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will be disadvantaged because of air travel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be remembered that 50%, and sometimes more than 50%, of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> now travel from the United Kingdom by air. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The large air movement of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> over the past 10 years has demonstrated that the 88 lb of luggage a person provided for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming by air has been sufficient to cover the belongings that they wished to bring with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am confident, as is my Department, that the new arrangements for the carriage of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will prove to be effective in future years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of those recently settled, such as <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, are still in the process of buying their homes and the closure of the gold mining will simply mean that a substantial number of these people will be obliged to pack up and leave Kalgoorlie without a penny to bless themselves with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 preface my question to the Minister for Social Services by reminding him that yesterday the honourable member for Perth asked the Minister for Immigration whether he was aware of the concern and resentment of elderly <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who found that, in spite of naturalisation, they are denied the age pension because they have not been in Australia for 10 years and he referred to their complaints of being treated as second class citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, is it not a fact that the Australian Labor Party also required <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to become Australian citizens before being eligible to receive age pensions and is it not a fact that it was this LiberalCountry Party Government which removed this bar to the receipt of pensions by <span class="highlight">migrants</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government and its predecessors have done more in this field to help <span class="highlight">migrants</span> than any other government has done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will be happy to provide the House and the honourable member with a detailed account of what the Government has done in this field, but I suggest to the House that we have gone as far as it is possible to go in helping <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who meet some misfortune when they arrive in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true, of course, that pensions payable in Australia are vastly greater than the pensions available in the countries from which many of these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Wide Bay says, a lot of British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We arc told that, of some 185,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who will come to Australia in 1970, approximately one-third will settle in the West. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I contend it is unnecessary, just as it is unnecessary to require <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to meet a 3-year residential qualification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime are Maltese <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with British status restricted to a residential qualifying period in the same way as are aliens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there a residency qualification, notwithstanding naturalisation, of 10 years for eligibility for an age pension and 5 years for eligibility for an invalid pension for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from most countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, do some <span class="highlight">migrants</span> therefore receive the invalid pension until they reach the age of 65 years (for males) or 60 years (for females) and then lose all pension benefits until they have been in this country for 10 years and become eligible for an age pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Immigration whether his attention has been drawn to a recent article in a South Australian newspaper quoting  Mr Giordano,  publisher of a monthly bulletin, as saying that more should be done in the field of housing for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he comment also on the progress of the new flat programme for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and indicate when this programme will be applied to South Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>J recall seeing the article to which the honourable gentleman refers and, as 1 interpret my recollection of that article,  Mr Giordano  was suggesting that the Commonwealth should provide flats which could be sold to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> at low rates of interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of permanent accommodation for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> does not fall within my sphere of responsibility but I want to observe two factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>States are the principal suppliers, of relatively low cost housing for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement the Commonwealth has made available substantial sums of money to the States to finance these programmes but the Commonwealth has no control over their implementation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the second place, since the inception of the migration programme it has generally been agreed that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> should not be placed in a position of advantage or preferment in connection with housing or other facilities by comparison with native born members of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However this does not preclude measures being taken to offset the disadvantages at which resettlement places <span class="highlight">migrants</span> vis-a-vis the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to the latter part of the honourable member’s question as I recall it, I inform him that our responsibility as a Commonwealth lies in the provision of initial transitory accommodation for Commonwealth nominated <span class="highlight">migrants</span> which takes 2 forms, flats and hostels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What consideration has been extended to the proposal that a reciprocal agreement should be negotiated between Australia and Malta which would have the effect of extending to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Malta of British nationality the same social service benefits which accrue to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Britain and New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the total number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> resident in Australia who are eligible for naturalisation but who as yet have not applied for naturalisation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why do eligible <span class="highlight">migrants</span> not apply for citizenship? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall that, when I last checked the matter to which the honourable member refers, I ascertained that as at 30th June 1969 there were some 208,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> over the age of 16 years and residentially qualified for Australian citizenship who had not made application. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that a number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> do not make application for Australian citizenship results, I believe, from a fusion of factors which would include indecision at to longterm permanent residence in Australia; the fact that they may be waiting for other members of the family to become eligible before themselves making application; unawareness of the importance of citizenship; or being aware, the fact that they have not come to the point of making application or would prefer to become further established in the Australian community before playing a complete and meaningful part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has always been the policy of the Commonwealth Government that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> should become Australian citizens, not so much for the material benefits which this would confer upon them but rather because citizenship, once conferred, would enable them to play their full part as Australian citizens in the affairs of the community and to have the opportunity of total identification with the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave -  Mr Speaker,  one of the major new immigration initiatives to be taken by the Government in the course of this Parliament is in the area of migrant education - an area vital to the effective integration of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> into the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has approved details of a comprehensive programme of migrant education which will strengthen existing provisions and give effect to the policy announced by the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  on 8th October 1969 of Commonwealth financial support for new, improved and expanded facilities for the instruction of child and adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government recognises that the ability of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to communicate is fundamental to their successful integration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are short and long term social and human benefits for the migrant and for the community in encouraging and providing the means for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to learn English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New areas of need have become evident, and whilst there have been practical reasons in the past to concentrate on speaking and understanding the English language, the comprehensive programme now proposed will provide for more emphasis in the future to be placed on reading and writing English, on meeting the individual needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and on their citizenship education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The comprehensive programme will provide for: The expansion of existing facilities for the instruction of adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span>; the provision of intensive full time English language courses for those who must know English so that they can be employed in the occupations and professions for which they have been trained and are qualified; and classes for migrant school children with English language difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that a lack of knowledge of the language of the country sponsoring a great migration programme is the greatest barrier to the integration of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and their social and economic success. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am reminded particularly of the problem associated with the education of the children of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first, most obvious, and most severe problem area for many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst we deal with the problems of children and teachers and questions relating to the social and economic integration of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, at this stage there appears to be a much more lively interest being taken by the Government and organisations in the education of adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that a survey by the Department of Immigration indicated that about one-third of foreign born <span class="highlight">migrants</span> cannot speak English and that departmental English classes assist only a small proportion of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to say that women and <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the age group 30 to 39 years are largely missing from numbers attending English classes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One aspect of the migration programme that appears to come under criticism at this stage is that, whilst thousands of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are being brought to the country, the States are not being given a commensurate amount of money to provide education, housing and other factors associated with a great migration programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this programme is fulfilled in the way that the Minister has outlined today and comes to fruition as he has said, it undoubtedly will be a forward step in providing for the education of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and their integration into the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage I see no reason why it should be opposed - we may be able to improve it - and I join with the Minister in expressing the hope that it will allow the thousands of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who today suffer from not having a thorough understanding of the English language to integrate socially and economically and in every way take full advantage of the opportunities given to them in this country under the migration programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are great numbers of young <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from the Villawood migrant hostel going to that school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>7m for departmental other services include $1.5m for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, $4.4m for embarkation and passage costs for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, $2.2m for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, $].6m for war and service pensions and allowances, $].4m for other repatriation benefits, $5m for the Ship Building Division of the Department of Shipping and Transport, $1.3m for grants under the Aged Persons Homes Act and $l.lm for remission of taxes and fines under special circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What action has been taken to rectify the position discussed by Professor W. F.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The comprehensive programme outlined in that statement with respect to adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and’ intensive courses will provide remedies in a number of the areas to which Professor Connell referred in his paper ‘Education for Adult <span class="highlight">Migrants</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-33-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On Sunday night I had the pleasure and privilege of meeting about 40 medical practitioners, 5 of whom were <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from England. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In countries where foot and mouth disease is known to be prevalent or endemic and from which regular shipping services operate it is usual for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are defined as ‘rural’ types to be given visas which restricts them to travel by sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for favouring sea travel for ‘rural’ <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is because the longer travelling time reduces the amount of any chance virus contamination that may be present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We realise the importance of housing to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> but the honourable gentleman will well appreciate the overall exigencies which must guide Government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I do emphasise to the honourable gentleman that this number of returning <span class="highlight">migrants</span> must be seen against the record number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who will come to Australia during the course of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that the achievement during the course of the current financial year will be 8,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> more than last year’s record total and 9,000 more than the target at which we have been aiming for the present financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the reasons for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> returning to their homelands I point out that the studies which have been taken out indicate that rarely can these reasons be put down to single identifiable causes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In looking at this question one must appreciate that a number of people today recognise that we live in a time in which there is unparalleled mobility between countries, that a number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> do come to Australia without the intention of permanently remaining here, that some do pass on to other countries and that there are many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who return to their source countries for reasons which may be personal or related to their employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our studies indicate that these reasons account for a substantial number of returning <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Immigration a question arising from the clause in the migration agreement with Yugoslavia which provides that Yugoslav <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will not be called up for military service in Australia if they are 20 years and 1 month or more at the time when they arrive in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There will be greater provision of part time accelerated courses to meet the needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who for economic reasons cannot engage in full time instruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Advanced teaching techniques will be used to meet the needs of individual groups of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The full time intensive course of instruction which was first introduced early in 1969 is designed specifically to meet the needs of professional and other qualified <span class="highlight">migrants</span> for whom an adequate knowledge of English is a pre-requisite to their being suitably employed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a general rule only <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have reached a certain educational level are able to benefit effectively from this particular type of instruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 5 relates to the proposed new arrangements for the child migrant education programme as well as to existing arrangements for adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and for fulltime intensive courses of instruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Full-scale production of material designed specifically for child <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will possibly take two to three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt may be useful if I were to explain that schools which will qualify for financial assistance under the special programme for child <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will be those where a special teacher is employed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that in the future a great many settlers will come here from the United States, that as more come they will generate a chain reaction, and in future the United States is likely to become one of our major sources of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe we need <span class="highlight">migrants</span> at the rate we are getting them, and at the rate we can get them, but it may well be that in accepting the need for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> we are overlooking some real economic facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> corning from foot and mouth disease countries are carefully screened and if they are rural’ people (i.e. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some cases these ‘rural’ <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are allowed to travel by air (e.g. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The test of this is that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> go to a State depending on the opportunities available to them and depending on the reports they get from their friends and relatives already in the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A couple of weeks ago the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Lynch)  claimed great credit and announced with a very great flourish that the Government would be bringing in about 180,000 immigrants a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instead of marshalling the resources of the credit unions and encouraging this important work of providing homes for the newly marrieds, for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming into this country and for all of the people wanting to build this nation through building houses, as they must, the Government has remained cold and aloof from the human problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After the first World War the British Government financed <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to come to the south west of Western Australia and a group scheme was started in 1921 at Manjimup. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-29-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She might have noted also that Western Australia consistently is absorbing far more than its proportionate share of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A building industry spokesman is reported to have said: “After this finance trouble here, it could take years to instil confidence in prospective <span class="highlight">migrants</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The unsewered areas are the developing areas of our cities where most <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and most children live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700609_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By March, notwithstanding the big inflow of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and the entry of more and more married women into the work-force, the labour situation had become very tight, with job vacancies well above the number of registered applicants for work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700818_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that as Australia heads into the 1970s we face a far greater challenge in recruiting a skilled work force from the various countries from which we have drawn <span class="highlight">migrants</span> during the postwar period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think initially of the extension of the employer nomination service, the extension of our counselling services to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and the extension of our advisory services to skilled and professional <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time, as for the past 10 years, of the total worker component of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, we attract to Australia some 40%.I would expect that in the future, because of the initiatives that have been taken, we will at least maintain the 40% intake of skilled workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Would the honourable gentleman give permission to allow such <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to take an oath of allegiance to the Commonwealth of Australia as a voluntary alternative? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I say without hesitation that our appreciation of culture has improved since we have had such a huge inflow of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has there been an increase in the 1970-71 appropriation for the repatriation of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been an increase in that section of the 1970-71 Estimates which covers repatriation of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May 1 respond finally in this way: Although we will be spending this year approximately $500,000 under this item which covers repatriation of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> but also includes deportations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That includes the cost of the administration of the Department of Immigration and the bringing of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia, lt has been suggested that the cost of each migrant is about $10,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we are aware, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have made a significant contribution to the growth of this country but it is time we looked at our own Australian families and did something more positive for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also think that they are not exactly adverse to the continual increase in their domestic consumer market that nearly 200,000 extra <span class="highlight">migrants</span> per annum provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1945 when the then Minister for Immigration, the Honourable Arthur Calwell, introduced a programme to bring <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia in vast numbers the population of Australia was a little over 7 million. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Today, through the influence and impact of over 2 million <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, Australia has become a mini melting pot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if as much as 2% of our gross national product is required to meet the social capital needs of our new <span class="highlight">migrants</span> - surely an upper limit - our rate of investment remains quite high by comparison with most other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With a large number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming into the country every year there has been a great need for work to be found for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even when the rural sector of the economy is in good heart and flourishing there is not sufficient call from that source for labour, nor are the skills required for farm and station work in Australia readily available amongst the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have come to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have always supported the Government in the past in its policies arising from the fact that jobs must be found for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the secondary and tertiary sectors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1  have heard reference in the House to-day to the pressures on the provision of services - the millions of dollars required for education, the provision of water supply facilities, the National Health Bill and the provision of power, housing and many other like facilities for the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as they come in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These young people who because of high home costs and shortage of housing must have a working wife and put off having our most valuable <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, a family born here, are going to pay more for their family planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the influx of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and with thousands of young Australians reaching marriageable age, the demand is considerable from the private sector, from building societies and from housing commissions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The policy to bring European <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, initially in the unfortunate category of displaced persons, to Australia was developed by the right honourable member for Melbourne and has basically remained unchanged through the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For these reasons it has not been possible to measure the additional expenditure, on services of the types specified, required for the purpose of absorbing new <span class="highlight">migrants</span> into the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However it is proposed to examine this whole question, not only the costs but the benefits conferred by <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the cost-benefit analysis which T have arranged to be undertaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One matter that has been brought to my notice over the past few weeks is that thousands of Turkish <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have come into the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that the major financial difficulties of State governments flow directly from the Commonwealth’s immigration policy, whereby it spends more than S50m a year to bring <span class="highlight">migrants</span> here only to dump them mercilessly, relentlessly and unceremoniously into the laps of State governments to nurture, house, educate and employ them, without any consideration for the ability or otherwise of the authorities which must of necessity be the final link in a migrant’s rehabilitation in his new country - the local government authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The plight of elderly <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is another matter that has been overlooked by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We even apply these restrictions to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Commonwealth countries, such as Malta. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because we do not have reciprical arrangements with Malta, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from that country are not eligible for the age pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very briefly I want to bring to the notice of the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  a matter which I think exemplifies the need to amend the Social Services Act in order to give justice to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and Australians generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a time when we are clamouring for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> it is hardly a good advertisement for the world to know that in Australia under a Liberal government, firstly, a person over 100 years of age cannot get an age pension, secondly, he is ineligible for an invalid pension and, thirdly, no suitable employment is available to him and his only means of sustenance is $10 a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, I believe the Minister should adopt the policy of the Labor Party and make welfare benefits available to all Australians and eliminate the system whereby a person more than a century old is ineligible for welfare benefits which, putting it mildly, hardly assists our drive for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Secretary for Law also said when he introduced the Bill that it was necessary to have control so that the magistrates will have power to deal with these unemployed <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spreading the costs only over the 1.7 million <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have received assisted passages, the cost amounts to around $435 a bead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-57">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>cost savings to Australia for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>’ pre-  employment training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a resolution adopted by the annual convention of the New South Wales Division of the Liberal Party that the Department of Immigration should operate a more effective system of screening and selection to limit the arrival of undesirable <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place, as the House will appreciate, the governments of a number of countries from which we draw our <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, particularly those in the European area, take the view that under their nationality laws a former citizen of one of those countries does not lose his citizenship of that country if he acquires Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question which is to the Minister for Immigration by referring to a resolution adopted by the annual convention of the New South Wales Division of the Liberal Party that the Department off Immigration should operate a more effective system of screening and selection in order to limit the arrival of undesirable <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that I am unaware of the reasons which were advanced for it but I want to observe that over a quarter of a century in which Australia has had experience in the promotion of a high level immigration programme our record in relation to selection and assessment of the 2.6 million <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have come to this country post- 1945 has been very good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think of the reports we have received of the incidence of mental illness and crime among <span class="highlight">migrants</span>; of the reports that we have received on migrant youth; of the fact that the Australian system has been well commended by international authorities in the field of immigration; of the fact that our experience has been sought by other countries with high level immigration programmes, and finally of the fact that 2.6 million people who have come here in the post-war period have with some difficulties been effectively integrated into the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Western Australia the proportion of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to population is higher than that of any other State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that it represents those people and it does not represent the wage earner, the worker, the salary earner and those who come out here as <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and who have to build homes at tremendous cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pity of it is that so many of the people who are forced to accept this accommodation are <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have come to this country to escape this type of crowded community development so that their children might have a better future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He further advised me that the number of permanent and long term arrivals for residence of one year or longer in Australia between October 1945 and June 1970 was 3,385,676, of whom is is estimated some 2,696,000 were <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an inclination to blame <span class="highlight">migrants</span> for the shortage of housing, the demands on education, overcrowding of the cities and a number of other problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time it is wrong to blamethe <span class="highlight">migrants</span> for all these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where the Labor Party differs from the Government is that we say that, having brought <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia in their thousands, we have a responsibility to provide adequate finance to the State and local government authorities for education, housing, hospitals, and development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>State governments, starved of money by the Commonwealth, were left with the responsibility of educating <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, English and non-English, and the responsibility of providing hospitals, homes, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be necessary to set different targets, different types of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, and maybe to revise the approach to the accepted goals of the past in regard to numbers, types, educational and trade qualifications and matters of this nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present scheme was introduced by the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell)  when he was Minister for immigration in the Chifley Government, and it has been continued by succeeding Liberal and Country Party Governments.I think it is a matter for some pride, that Australia has absorbed some 2.6 million <span class="highlight">migrants</span> since 1945. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sure, there have been strains on housing and education, and, sure, there has been a tendency for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to settle in the already crowded cities of this continent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the Second World War, Australia has been fortunate in being able to attract a reason ale number of suitable <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to this country, but these conditions may not always prevail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past, the numbers of immigrants coming to Australia has varied with wars, disasters, booms and depressions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today, with economic buoyancy in Northern Europe and less unemployment in Southern Europe, it has become necessary for Australia to look farther afield for suitable <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And let us avoid the traps of other nations; let us continue to bring to this country only such <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as can be readily integrated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, unlike the honourable member for Deakin I do not go so far as to agree that there is a need to set up a committee of inquiry and then explain why we ought to keep on increasing our intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very crux of an inquiry by such a committee is whether we should in fact continue our present rate of intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eighteen years after Captain Cook, Captain Phillip arrived with a fleet of ships bearing our first <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the immigrants came from the finest families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The others were carefully selected for their qualities and the selections were confirmed by some of the finest judges in England, litis planned immigration policy continued for a number of years with the immigrants being housed in cosy little migrant hostels at Port Arthur in the south, at Botany Bay on the east coast and Moreton Bay in the north. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gradually this method of government selection of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> fell into disuse and good old private enterprise took over with the expected bumbling and stumbling that is usually associated with the selfinterest of private enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another major innovation would be an in-depth study of up to 10,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the early years we had the problem of the .war .refugees when it was_npt .possible to screen our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the way it is possible to screen them today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite this, we have been remarkably free of undesirable <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This situation has not been caused by the inflow of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> alone, but undoubtedly this has had an effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> must be fed, clothed mid have housing provided for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We require training in many more skills and the pressure on our education system is attributable largely to the tremendous intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and migrant families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the areas of complaint has been from a very small section of primary producers who feel that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have contributed, in part at least, to the rising costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people, even in high places in Australia, who are prepared to play with Communism and weaken our defences ought to take the opportunity of talking to some of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have been through all this in Europe and they may  -  I hope will- change their opinions completely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The type and calibre of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have come here are a standing monument to the excellence of our overseas officers and to the thoroughness of their attempts to secure the best people who will become assimilated and integrated in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have built better accommodation for our <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are providing flats for our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> so that they can live here under better conditions as soon as they are able to get jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our education programme we have provided broadcast programmes for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, special lessons in factories and places of work, crash courses in English for adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span> so thai they are more quickly able to fit into the community and, perhaps most important of all, we have introduced English training programmes for migrant children in our schools so that they are not disadvantaged in their training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, we have gone a long way along the road in recognising the skills and qualifications of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite resistance from a number of areas and a number of institutions we have been able to persuade many institutes, organisations and trade unions to accept the qualifications of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also need <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to develop our home market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Deakin pointed out that the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> we have received in modern times have given us a lead over the immigration rate that even (he United States of America achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently I was invited to address an informal group of young <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from a European country on Australia’s political setup. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, they offered the view that they were afraid to take part in political activity because of a general feeling that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who took part in political parties other than the Government parties may be refused naturalisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Minister has assured the House that the numbers refused naturalisation for political reasons were small, I am very concerned with the development of this view among <span class="highlight">migrants</span> under our immigration plan, particularly amongst such a very responsible group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chain migration enables the base families to act as welfare officers to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the best methods of convincing <span class="highlight">migrants</span> that facility in the use of English is so very important? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I can give a measurement of this contribution, in 1968-69 out of a total Australian work force of 5.27 million people about 1.3 million were <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People speak, quite rightly, about the cost of bringing settlers to Australia, but we must always remember that a significant proportion of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are classified as skilled or semiskilled personnel and their settling here has been estimated to save Australia $US8,000 per average worker in preemployment training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia, by the introduction of aspects of vastly differing cultures, have contributed enormously towards the development of a more cosmopolitan society in Australia, and this has been of tremendous benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This must not be a one-way process though, as there is still a tremendous need for the Australian community as a whole to gain a more knowledgeable attitude and fuller appreciation of the problems immigrants face and the ways in which <span class="highlight">migrants</span>* contributions to this country’s future can be realised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I firmly believe our immigration policy should be based on the needs of this country, the availability of suitable <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and the capacity of the Australian community to integrate <span class="highlight">migrants</span> into our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This requires that personnel employed at our overseas selection centres should be equipped and trained to promulgate an accurate picture of Australian conditions to ensure that intending <span class="highlight">migrants</span> do not get a false impression of this country and the conditions they are likely to experience when they arrive here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also requires that the selection procedures for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> should be such as to reduce to a minimum selection of undesirable <span class="highlight">migrants</span> or those who would experience untoward difficulty in assimilating into the society of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Government should make it very clear that it is not interested in breaking records with respect to the acquisition of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our capacity to integrate <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with benefit to the total society has been well documented, but I believe it would be wrong not to question just how many additional people are needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the Department of Immigration is aware of these problems and by the provision of migrant educational services, social workers, welfare officers, trained contact workers, together with a host of voluntary workers, it does much to reduce the problems of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A cost-benefit analysis of immigration and time span surveys of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> during their early years will provide much needed back-up data and disclose avenues for further initiative in the selection and integration of settlers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that problems still exist for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the early years in which they are in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A wonderful job has been done both by old Australians and by the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> themselves in overcoming so many of these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One matter that I think is worthy of mention this evening is that where we seem to have failed most miserably in the integration and assimilation of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is in the field of politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The responsibility for this must rest very heavily on the propaganda that is fed to the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in their early days in this country when, to my knowledge and that of many honourable members on this side of the House, it is obvious that attempts are made to poison them against Labor’s political persuasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have not been sponsored by members of the Government Parties for any seats which it has been possible in the past for them to win and so become members of any of our parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that a genuine endeavour has been made by my Party in recent years to sponsor political awareness and understanding among <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only in 1949-50 did the net intake of immigrants to this country exceed 2 per cent of the national population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the long-standing, theoretical aim of a 1 per cent net population gain of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> intake is to be achieved in the 1970s the gross arrival figures will need to rise above 200,000 almost immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is one small problem in a country which by Government policy and by Opposition inclination and otherwise says that it is to some extent interested in decentralisation, and that is that the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> by and large, despite the good work they do in some areas of agriculture and in some areas of the country, are concentrated in our urban areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find, for example, that in my City of Hobart approximately 11 per cent - a relatively low level - of the population are <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, roughly half British and half other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem as we face it will be considerably reduced as time progresses by the greater selectivity of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will, I presume, tend to obviate some of the difficulties which have arisen in relation to returning <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, although the studies that have been done on returning <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, inadequate though they might be in number, suggest that the problems involved and the reasons for return are not nearly as black or as bad as is often painted publicly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But necessarily, with increasing selectivity of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, some of these problems will be solved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we increase our selectivity and accent the possibility of integration, which I think is now the new word rather than ‘assimilation’, of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with the Australia community as we now find it, we will find that those crossroads can be suitably passed and not necessarily in only one direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> are being poured into the metropolitan complexes with a reckless disregard to the quality of life and to the balanced development of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are not all being drawn from overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sydney and Melbourne these days are drawing <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from a countryside in crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other half of the population includes  a  group of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, refugees from a countryside in depression, a large number of pensioners,  a  whole series of high rise developments which contain a majority of deserted wives and Service wives, women without husbands, and children without fathers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third area of consideration, the time span surveys of the experiences of some 10,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, is of course appropriate for departmental study and in fact that study has already been initiated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Burke  (Mr Keith Johnson)  asked the basic question: Should we continue to seek as many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as possible? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to a question in this House some weeks ago I indicated that our objective for the year ending 30th June 1971 is 180,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member also referred to the naturalisation of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this sense, ethnic concentrations can be seen as advantageous to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the short term, before they move into outlying suburban areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (2)In general, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are not disadvantaged under law in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such provisions can affect non-naturalise <span class="highlight">migrants</span> (aliens) or <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have recently arrived in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the laws of some States the overseas dependents of deceased <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are not eligible to receive payments under Workers’ Compensation legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have arrived in Australia in each of the last 10 years and what was the total for the period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From which countries did these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> come what was the total number from each country, and what was the number of (a) males; (b) females; and (c) children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that a number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> do not make application for Australian citizenship when they are legally eligible to do so results from a variety of factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturalisation Promotion Officers in New South Wales and Victoria, work through national groups, employer and employee organisations, the Good Neighbour Councils and other organisations interested in the integration of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>; also Mobile Units tour selected areas in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia to furnish citizenship information, accept applications and interview applicants; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (2) Neither ibe Department’s staff of 15 social workers nor the 25 social workers employed with community agencies engaged in welfare work amongst <span class="highlight">migrants</span> (whose salaries are financed by the Commonwealth) include a Finnish speaking social worker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ideally social workers who work with <span class="highlight">migrants</span> should have an understanding of their cultural and social backgrounds, and it is desirable that they should speak the language of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> whom they are assisting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department’s social worker establishment includes some who have been trained overseas or who have qualified since their arrival in Australia as <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, many of the integration problems encountered by <span class="highlight">migrants</span> do not require the services of professionally qualified social workers, but can be handled effectively by trained welfare staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department plans to increase its social worker establishment preferably with those who have an intimate knowledge of the background of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The poor Greek <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have been taken for a ride and have been robbed of hundreds of dollars above the right fare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The poor <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have been openly robbed and/ or at this moment also with this charter on 20lh September 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Immigration: Does his Department render financial assistance to the States to provide low cost housing for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> brought to this country by the Department of Immigration? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Housing is of vital concern not only to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> but to all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second comment I make is that whilst the Commonwealth has a responsibility to do all in its power to offset the difficult transition that is involved in the migration of people from one country to another, we should never reach the point where <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this community are placed in any position of preferment or privilege vis-a-vis Australians who are born here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion I say briefly that our responsibility as a Commonwealth lies in the provision of transitory accommodation for Commonwealth nominated <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They range from news, music, drama; documentaries; training for Asians, a worthwhile project; opera; school broadcasts; publishing; and, as an entrepreneur, visits by overseas artists, sustaining symphony orchestras, help for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, and the Washington Bureau link - the sorts of things the honourable member for Curtin  (Mr Garland)  has been talking about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your Petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives make legal provision for a joint Commonwealth-State inquiry into inequalities in Australian education to obtain evidence on which to base long term national programmes for the elimination of inequalities; the immediate financing of special programmes for low income earners, <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, Aboriginal, rural and inner suburban dwellers and handicapped children; and the provision of pre-school opportunities for all children from culturally different or socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable gentleman will have noticed the high proportion of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> among the dead and injured, and I trust he will recall that I have had 3 questions on the notice paper, one for more than 6 months - longer than all but 9 of the questions still on notice for him from the honourable member for Hindmarsh - about the rights of overseas dependants of workers killed or injured in industrial accidents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Could therecommendation have farreaching effects on our trade with other countries and result in a denial of the preferences for these cheeses by <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to Australia whom we are endeavouring to attract under our migration programme, <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the courseof this enquiry what consideration was given to the established preferences of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who regard many of these cheeses such as Esrom,Emmenthaler, Jarlsberg, Erbo, Bel Passe, Montasio,Fontina, Lyden, Taffel, Graddost, Kaskaval,Tilsit, Ambrosia, Sheeps Milk Fetta, as art essential part of their dietary requirements for which there is no acceptable substitute in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They make their homes here and many of them become Australian citizens, lt seems to be unreal that we should be shackled to any direction or request by the British Government as to what benefits should or should not be received by British <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, especially those who have become Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I accordingly ask him what has happened to the investigatory process in this field where the Commonwealth, under international law as well as in the interests of law and order within our own country, has the prime responsibility, [ ask him further: Can he explain how no prosecutions have ever been launched in respect of any of those attacks which have taken place not only in the national capital but in the Victorian and New South Wales capitals and in other places such as Cooma where there are symbols of other countries which have supplied <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What is the likely result in relation to the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from the United Kingdom, which has also been subject to Press comment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as the overall pattern is concerned, as questioned by the honourable member, 1 can say in quite confident terms that we have every expectation that this year we will achieve our target of 180,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> which, as the honourable member would appreciate, is a figure based upon an assessment of national needs and objectives, the availability of good settlers and our capacity to integrate those who come here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although this year we will meet the overall target, I would expect that the British migration figures will be down and that we will receive somewhere between 60,000 and 65,000 British <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that one of the major concerns felt by prospective <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in considering the decision to migrate to Australia is that on settlement here they will be unable to return home in the event of illness or bereavement amongst their relatives in their homelands or in other types of emergencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701027_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives make legal provision for a joint Commonwealth-State inquiry into inequalities in Australian education to obtain evidence on which to base long term national programmes for the elimination of inequalities; the immediate financing of special programmes for low income earners, <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, Aboriginal, rural and inner suburban dwellers and handicapped children; and the provision of pre-school opportunities for all children from culturally different or socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-0-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for Immigration: How many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> left Australia last year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many of these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were dissatisfied? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What action is he taking to ensure that all <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who come to Australia are integrated into the community as quickly and harmoniously as possible? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As at June 1970 the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who returned to their home countries was about 27,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is fair to say that some of that group were undoubtedly what may loosely be called disgruntled <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One irritating facet of Press reports of this issue is that when the number of returning <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is reported in daily newspapers the total number is inevitably prefaced with the word ‘disgruntled’ when in fact that is not the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> return home for a wide diversity of reasons and the investigations that have been carried out by my Department indicate that these reasons reflect as much on the personalities of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as on the conditions in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> return home for personal reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Information is not available to indicate with accuracy the movement of British assisted <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to and from Whyalla. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-42-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is estimated that in the 5 years to the end of June 1970 more than 10,600 British assisted <span class="highlight">migrants</span> indicated upon arrival in Australia their intention to proceed to Whyalla. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-42-12">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Are English <span class="highlight">migrants</span> the only <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have to reimburse the Australian Government if they return to England within 2 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-50-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth is to provide the cost of teachers, certain capital equipment, text books, supervisory assistance, and allowances for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> studying certain courses, and will give incentives to industry to assist in the educational programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without a knowledge of the language <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are not only at a distinct disadvantage in respect of employment but also their general participation in community activities and our way of life is denied to them if they are unable to speak and understand our language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not so much a criticism of what has been or is being done for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this regard but rather that a more comprehensive scheme has been delayed so long, particularly in view of the constant urging by conventions and immigration authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, having in mind the Government’s sustained drive for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, has this aspect of migration been neglected, or at least, has the Department not been insistent enough in the priority that should be given to migrant education? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provision of educational services to enable adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to learn the English language began in 1947 in the opening days of post-war immigration schemes or, if I may say so, in the infancy of the programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since that time, great changes have taken place in the immigration programme, such as increased numbers, differing types of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and methods of transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that more than 50 per cent of the 700,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> requiring instruction in English discontinued the classes would seem to present proof that a new and stimulating approach was needed in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many thousands of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have neglected to do this for many and varied reasons, lt has yet to be proved whether the incentive and the expansion of the educational programme as outlined will encourage them to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since  1945  more than  2  million <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have come to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, what indication has been given that the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, whom I would describe as being :on the fringe’, that is, those who have no special educational qualifications or inclination but who must know English for employment and other purposes, will be more interested than they have been previously in learning English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Information has already been given to the House that only  47  per cent of the  708,000  <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have come to Australia and attended pre-embarkation ship board, continuation or correspondence courses, have completed the course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even in November  1969  only  14,840  <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were enrolled in  1,050  continuation classes, and  7,780  <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were taking combined radio and correspondence courses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> involved, these figures are by no means heartening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>T believe that industries employing large numbers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> should, at their own cost, provide classes in English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should also encourage <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to learn the language for safety and economic reasons, and it should be done at the employers’ expense during working hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the scheme should cover the whole range of industry, and I suggest to the Minister that implementation of an extensive campaign throughout industry along the lines I have mentioned might bring success in the recruitment of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to English classes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today, for a number of reasons, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> discontinue their classes and their education in the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The predominant groups of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with English difficulties are the Italians, Greeks, Yugoslavs - totalling 61 per cent of the sample. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Comparison shows that a significant proportion of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with poor school progress came from homes where English is never spoken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Based on evidence from departmental surveys it would be reasonable to estimate that approximately one-third of foreign bom <span class="highlight">migrants</span> would be unable to speak English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Applied to the foreign bom migrant population this would mean that some 240,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> would benefit from English language instruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has certainly taken the Government a long time to realise how unfair it is to teachers, children and State authorities to bring non-English speaking <span class="highlight">migrants</span> into the country in thousands and leave the full responsibility for their education at every level to State governments and independent schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A national campaign seeking the co-operation of voluntary organisations, industries, clubs, progress associations, churches and other sections of the community would be a forward step in the education of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that unless <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have pre-embarkation instruction, they land in Australia without any knowledge at all of the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is quite different from the days when practically all <span class="highlight">migrants</span> travelled by ship and an education officer gave them instruction in the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As it stands, it means that the Government reluctantly has accepted the fact that it has a responsibility to the children, the States and the teachers to provide some finance for the thousands of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have been brought to Australia, but it is confining it to the very minimum and leaving the responsibility for finding additional capital to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only a small percentage will be spent on the education of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, yet this is generally accepted as the most important factor in their assimilation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government recognises that the ability of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to communicate is fundamental to their successful integration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are short and long term social and human benefits for the migrant and for the community in encouraging and providing the means for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to learn English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> may never attend an advanced course, perhaps because of lack of educational facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">migrants</span> that I have mentioned must have  an  earnest desire to learn the language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether any investigations have been made concerning what percentage of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this category, or men and women over school age, really want to learn the language, and what is their intellectual capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 feel that another method that might be applied - and no doubt it already has been to a great extent, but it could be more widely used - is an intensive publicity campaign among non-English speaking <span class="highlight">migrants</span> on the need to learn the English’ language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every form of available advertising should be used to impress upon these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> prior to acceptance, embarkation on shipboard or on plane and on arrival how vital it is to learn English in order to enjoy a happy and successful life in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every industry, every bank, every public office or in fact any medium of publicity should be utilised with display signs impressing the need of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to communicate and learn English and advising them how they can go about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst not criticising the objectives and the principles prompting the legislation on the education of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, I believe that there are still gaps through which countless thousands of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will escape the opportunity to learn English and participate in our community, economic and social life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an endeavour to offer a constructive approach to improving the education of adult and child <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and to relieving the States of some of the responsibility for a national programme of immigration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I offer this amendment as a constructive approach to improve the child and adult education of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> brought to Australia in a scheme commenced 25 years ago which has always had the sympathy and support of honourable members on all sides of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope the Minister will see fit to accept the amendment because I believe it will make a major contribution towards overcoming the difficulties in the education of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> that I have mentioned during the course of my speech tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first of those conferences dealt substantially with the problems of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as seen by various workers in the field of immigrant education and interest in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most lasting impression that I got from that conference was of the difficulties faced by <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in coping with the English language, most notably by those with least access to it, and particularly by migrant housewives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the suggestion is that we have perhaps with some complacence but certainly with considerable agreement across the board or across the floor of this House and elsewhere in the community conducted a programme of immigration which has made various gestures and various activity projects to inculcate into <span class="highlight">migrants</span> the best understanding that seems possible in a given time of the English language, whereby they could better be assimilated - 1 think the word is now integrated - into the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are the question of educating migrant children, the question of the extension and improvement of adult education in one or more parts of the world, and the question of an intensive language course for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> better versed in some skill or other who possibly are already acquainted with the rudiments of the English language and are better able to comprehend an intensive course than are others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although approximately one-third of foreign born <span class="highlight">migrants</span> cannot in any effective way speak English when they get here, the intake in recent years in adult evening education classes conducted, to take one or two examples, has been quite considerably less than the number of current arrivals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1968- 69, 21,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> enrolled whereas 61,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who needed to do so, in effect, arrived in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would appear to be money well spent because we are talking of people who are very likely on a per capita basis to infuse into the community a very considerable contribution not only by their efforts and through their own skills in other areas but also, one would imagine, probably by virtue of the fact of having these skills and being capable of acquiring expression in English - and other languages for that matter - more rapidly are they likely to be leaders of their own communities, insofar as there are communities of new <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that through all this it should be borne in mind that, desirable though it is, it is not necessary - I do not imply that it is - that in attempting to teach English to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, adult or otherwise, wherever we might aim, that we have to achieve perfection in a short period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not achieve it amongst most of our students, and perhaps it would be overmuch to expect to achieve it amongst <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we could get most of our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to that situation I am sure the Minister would be well pleased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So 1 think that ail of us here are very disturbed to hear these revelations which indicate the disadvantages to which <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are being subjected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  indicated that the migrant education programme commenced in 1947 after about 1,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> had come here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this year we are seeking about 175,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have added $70,000m to our gross national product over 20 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If all this is the case, although I know there are many who believe it is time we properly evaluated these alleged facts, clearly we should be thinking of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from the point of view that immigration is not a one-sided affair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are many manifestations that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are socially disadvantaged in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The success of Australia’s immigration programme has long been tarnished by an obtuse disinclination to evaluate the problems which <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and their children encounter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, we can say this of Australian children generally: that there are many thousands trying to get into universities, that there are probably thousands trying to get into kindergartens and that there are class loading problems and the like, but there are special problems with <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How many returning <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have left Australia in disillusionment have suffered from an inability to communicate because of insufficient skill with the English language? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the last 5 years 21,697 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who had come to Australia with assisted passages have packed up their bags and gone home within 2 years of arriving here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Most of us who work in this field and who make contact with <span class="highlight">migrants</span> know that the language problem often contributes to their unhappiness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a long time the Government has shown indecent haste to get <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, any sort of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, as long as they were of European extraction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What thought has been given to requiring intending <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to take a course in English prior to leaving their home country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  suppose another way of looking at it is to decide to be more selective and to bring to this country those <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have a knowledge of the English language because of their willingness to apply themselves to it before they arrive in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures I am quoting come from the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Lynch)  and I think they have a very clear relevance to the Bill since we are talking about educating <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to the Minister in case he has forgotten - and it is a long time since this Bill was first introduced - that this Bill has a very real relevance to teaching <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to speak English and classes are to be set up under this legislation for that precise purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are enrolments in courses where <span class="highlight">migrants</span> learn to speak English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is - and surveys have shown this - that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> do not last long at the courses for reasons best known to themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is estimated that less than  10  per cent of the yearly intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> needing English instruction actually complete the courses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are in a hostel, possibly sacrificing their employment, they should be given financial assistance probably by way of the payment of unemployment benefits so that they will be encouraged to continue in these language courses which, in the end, will bring such a considerable benefit to themselves and to Australia generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proportion of these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who speak English at home all the time amounts to only 4 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only inhibiting factor is the unwillingness of the Government to invoke some of these new techniques which would enable <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to be educated through radio programmes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>the Sydney Metropolitan Area-  which is the area in which there is the highest incidence of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who need this kind of special instruction -   . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is there against making available special radio facilities to assist with the education of migrant children and adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are to be located in our great cities such as Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong, in view of the shortage of teachers and the inability of this Government to provide the buildings and capital equipment which are so essential in migrant education, there is no reason at all why further radio stations and television channels should not be made available for this programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I particularly commend the proposition that we should invoke new techniques and use the mass media by way of radio and television facilities to give the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> the educational opportunities which they so desperately deserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When did he learn that at the last meeting  of  the Immigration Ministers the Commonwealth asked the Stales to examine their provisions within Workers’ Compensation Acts, so  far  as such Acts affected <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, with  a  view to reaching uniformity of conditions  (Hansard,  1st September 1970, page 821). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-31-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>la  view of the present difficulties we are experiencing with inflation, are the Minister and his Department giving serious consideration to cutting down temporarily on our intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, thus lessening demand on services? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matter of pre-embarkation instruction in English for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> was raised in this debate last night and I would like to state just what the Government is doing in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want happy contented <span class="highlight">migrants</span> it is essential that they have a good command of English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like the Minister to give further consideration to the provision of English lessons for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in such places as homes and church halls, I will explain quickly what I mean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have no desire to learn English and they forbid the use of it in the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Often the native borne Australian views it on a statistical basis and not from the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>’ point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am sure that the proposition which I should like to put forward is not novel, but basically there are 4 causes of difficulty for migrant children: Firstly, the question of education in a foreign language; secondly, the question of education in an alien culture; thirdly, the low income of the parents in many cases; and, fourthly, the concentration of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in relatively depressed urban areas with their depressed schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have to do is to explain to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> what allegedly the average Australian considers to be Australian values and customs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has expressed implied criticism, for example, of our system of social services, when explaining the difficulties that we have in these days in obtaining <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from many parts of Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would counteract such drives among certain groups in our migrant population if in the schools that the children of these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> attended, Italian history, Turkish history, German history, or whatever it may be, were taught. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mean the Commonwealth Parliament which will pass this legislation - provide funds for additional teachers to work as special teachers to deal with these <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What should happen is not that an ordinary teacher in an education department should be classed as a special teacher for this purpose but that an extra teacher should be provided for these <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that he is sympathetic to the general immigration proposition and the problems surrounding it.I think that a danger exists these days because many people who support the views expressed by the Government and Opposition Parties in this House are starting to talk about the quality of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We just do not want only well off or potentially well off <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it is reasonable to defend the Government and to say that, after all, this whole question of education is and has been traditionally and constitutionally a State responsibility as is the sponsorship of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remember very well, without referring to the quality of life, the quality of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who came to us after World War II. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The quality of these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> was absolutely superlative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These people have proved to be excellent <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without going over the previous debates, 1 would like to reiterate my view that one of the most serious areas of underprivilege in addition to the single pensioner group is amongst <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of these associations have parents and friends who can apply pressures on the Government, but <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are not in that position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Canada seeks to attract only those <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with skills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that there are fewer <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in country schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I may be making a mild criticism, but I think it is most important for us to organise teaching of English to intending <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in their own country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But 1 would make the point that Greece, for example, is a country of dozens and dozens of islands, and very few of the Greek <span class="highlight">migrants</span> can possibly have any pre-embarkation language instruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have spoken to welfare officers and chaplains who have in the last few months come to Australia on vessels carrying <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, and there seems to be no doubt that a large number  -  10 per cent is a large number - of persons coming to Australia at the moment from the United Kingdom are really coming here for a holiday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am also concerned about the problems which are arising within the’ Yugoslav community in Australia because, as I recollect, when this legislation was foreshadowed and the immigration agreement with Yugoslavia was entered into a year or so ago the arrangement was that we were to receive a very large number of skilled tradesmen <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Threaded all through this report are references to the need for a better understanding of our language and a better understanding of tradesmen’s skills among <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole purpose of encouraging <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to learn English is to try to integrate them into our own community and not allow them to become separate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that they are of considerable benefit to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and I am thinking in particular of the Greek community and how much it has done to help Greek <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in counselling, securing employment and general social welfare work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One group of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> now coming in who have no ethnic group or particular affiliations in Australia are Asians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  have helped in settling some Asian <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and generally the Department of Immigration has been helpful, effective and speei.lv. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although we take some Filipino <span class="highlight">migrants</span> it does not accept any from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This whole question of the education of the children of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is a very important one and it is very interesting to note the number of honourable members who have offered to speak on the subject because it takes their attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has become a fact of life that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> stay at hostels for approximately  3  months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The high turnover of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the hostels means that the students are at the school for approximately  3  months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some accommodation at the school is used to teach the children of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> living in the hostel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the  3  months they are there, the children of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> sit blankly and stare into space because they cannot comprehend what is taking place around them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Frankly this problem goes a lot deeper than the teaching of English to the children of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today we arc dealing with the question of teaching the English language to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Approximately 50 per cent of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> still come to Australia by sea, and the 3 weeks sea voyage is a wonderful opportunity for the 40,000 non-English speaking <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who arrive here annually by this means to receive tuition in English and the Australian way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Much money is spent bringing <span class="highlight">migrants</span> out on cheap fares, more is spent teaching them and their children English, and a lot of them return home after making money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have heard it from a number of quarters - from industry and manufacturers - that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are creating a strain on the economy and that the programme should be cut back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1  believe that it is not in the long term interests of Australia that this should occur.In his policy speech before the  1969  election the Prime Minister announced the Government’s intention to take the initiative in promoting and accepting responsibility for expanding the existing facilities for the instruction of adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, to provide intensive full time English courses and to provide special courses in existing schools for migrant children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will do a great deal to help <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to become assimilated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Full-scale production of material designed specifically for child <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will possibly take 2 to 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we look at the areas where <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have settled in great numbers we see that the provision of such a building would be well worth while. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many other <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have been the victims of this sort of injustice, because our law is based on the statute of frauds which says that any dealing in property has to be in writing and has to be signed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This problem applies in the main to Asian <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the number of departures of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> returning (o their countries of origin we find that in 1970 the figure was as high as 35,000 or 36,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are coming out by plane so there is no opportunity to instruct them in the English language before they arrive here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">migrants</span> would be delighted if this were done, and I would say that in the main they would continue to live in Australia and we would reduce the number of departures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should look at it on the basis of the need of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who arrive here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this had been done in the past our immigration programme would have been much more successful and many more <span class="highlight">migrants</span> would have stayed in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But lack of English is a basic disadvantage to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming into this country when they are looking for jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The programme designed to teach <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to speak English has failed dismally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt of that, for in his pamphlet, Education for Adult <span class="highlight">Migrants</span>’, Professor W. F. Connel says that it appears that the language programme is steadily slipping backwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to say that a recent survey conducted by the Department of Immigration indicates that about one-third of foreign born <span class="highlight">migrants</span> cannot speak English, and the Department’s classes cater for only a small proportion of these. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From October 1968 to October 1969 there were 19,915 students enrolled in evening classes for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we must all agree that this enrolment of nearly 20,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in English language classes in 1 year in 1 State is very encouraging in that it indicates that our new arrivals are willing to learn the English language if given the opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did they abandon the classes because of the methods of teaching, or were their reasons, as some non-<span class="highlight">migrants</span> have said, economic? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the Federal Department of Education and Science, which is administering Commonwealth grants for the Department of Immigration, is insisting that teaching follow the situational method which is taught to adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in its classes for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While it may not be disturbing that the situation method should be used to instruct adults who are already well educated before coming here, that the Department should think highly enough of this method to thrust it on <span class="highlight">migrants</span> of little education is frightening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My misgivings about the exclusive use of the situation method of instruction of adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span> arise because there are 2 general groups of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> for whom this Bill does not make reasonable provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, there are the young <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, just out of school, not well educated and thrust immediately on their arrival here into the grinding and mindshackling mills of unskilled employment; and, secondly, there are the older <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, also not well educated but long out of school and confined to the home and thereby effectively isolated from the community in which they will live out their lives and isolated from the community which is supposed to give meaning to their lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But despite this, the Department is insisting that instruction, not only for adolescents and older <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, including those who will hardly be involved in the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> cannot be fitted into, for whatever purposes, an homogeneous group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather do <span class="highlight">migrants</span> comprise a number of sub-groups extensively diverse in terms of age, innate ability, achievement and desire for learning the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the Government has no real interest in spreading the use of English among <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who need English instruction hut that the Government is merely interested in turning out human capital, that is, people who will serve the economic machine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any programme for the instruction of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the English language should begin by instructing the foreign speaking migrant in his own language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an expanded programme for English instruction for larger numbers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is to be put into operation, a large increase in expenditure will be necessary, An appropriation of $990,000 was made for the education of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the 1969-70 financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Professor Connell strongly recommended the introduction of day classes for mothers, the expansion of pre-embarkation and on-ship courses and semi-intensive part time courses for all <span class="highlight">migrants</span> wishing to help themselves integrate into their new country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was to be the total grant spread over 3 years and took no account of the educational assistance required by adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So let us ensure thai our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have a proper understanding of their own language, or their own culture, and of our tongue, by the situation method if you like, but let us instruct them in all three concurrently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether we do this intentionally because we prefer assimilation to integration, or whether the determining factor is blind economic necessity, I have not yet determined, but the essential need of any integration programme is to keep together people who have an affinity of race or nationality, in order that they might strengthen each other during the period of integration, during that period of their lives in which they suffer greatly the inevitable tensions produced by cultural conflict and the material poverty which Professor Henderson tells us so many southern European <span class="highlight">migrants</span> suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know of no school in my electorate, which has a high density of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, where additional classroom facilities exist for the provision of a special English class for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rightly or wrongly the State governments feel that a far greater expenditure should have been forthcoming from the Commonwealth Government over an extended period on education, housing and other social activites connected with the establishment of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> mainly find unskilled jobs and if they are prepared to work under conditions which most trade unions would not accept they can earn high incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My understanding is that the authorities in Yugoslavia also are rather upset about our failure to recognise the trade qualifications of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet, the skills of Yugoslavs sent to Australia are not recognised and <span class="highlight">migrants</span> cannot practise their trades here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In some areas, notably in the inner city suburbs and in some specific areas of the larger provincial cities, there are very heavy concentrations of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In areas where there are large concentrations of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> - there are areas where  70  per cent,  80  per cent and up to  90  per cent of the population are <span class="highlight">migrants</span> - the ability to mix or the value of mixing with children who talk English does not exist, and therefore the migrant children are severely handicapped when they begin school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The type of social struct rues and prejudices which exist in Australia should be part of the programme in which <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are given instruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find, as I think most honourable members would, that <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, especially newly arrived <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, have very exaggerated ideas of what they can expect from our social welfare structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are matters on which I think <span class="highlight">migrants</span> should receive some pre-education or preinstruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am of the opinion that most <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who want to leave Australia decide before they even arrive here or in their first few weeks in Australia that they are not going to stay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tt is in these areas that I think there is great scope for improvement in our public relations with <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister may correct me if I am wrong, birt my understanding is that persons who have left Australia and returned to their own country cannot be used on ships as instructors for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> unless they have been out of Australia for at least 2 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Department wherever possible should avail itself of qualified people who have returned to their homeland and who are coming back to Australia and should use their knowledge of the country for the instruction of other <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>English <span class="highlight">migrants</span> especially who are returning to Australia are better able to explain the benefits that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> wilt receive in Australia or what goes on in Australia as compared with the position in their own countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are only minor things but I think they are important to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My experience, as 1 said before, is that most disillusioned <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are disillusioned before they get here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian community has adopted an attitude of great maturity and has received the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to its bosom in a very hospitable way, and not often enough does the community get this tribute paid to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From the day the first ship arrived with perhaps 1,200 or 1,500 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> on it, of which perhaps 300 or 400 were of school age, the problem started to expand, and it has been aggrevated by every shipload and every aeroplane load that has arrived since. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the responsibility of nobody else, lt is not good enough for the Minister to pour literally tens of thousands of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> into Victoria, let them try to survive under the tender mercies of the Bolte Government and then say that it is a State matter to supply education and hospitals and to build the roads. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Brunswick and Coburg, 2 centres in my electorate, have one of the greatest concentrations of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Several questions have been raised in this debate about the position of the Australian people regarding the kind of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> that come here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There we have the heaviest concentration of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in any inland areas but we also have the highest percentage of citizenship of any major migrant intake area in the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fundamental problem is that we are putting <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and Australians into situations fraught with dangers for the future of our people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problems of the children of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and the education of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are bound up with the demographic distribution of population in our community It is quite incredible that the demographic centre of Australia has not changed since the census of 1911. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is related to the problems of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, because in a situation of over-centralisation and overcrowding the problems are multiplied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 suggest that when we have an investigation of what we should be doing with the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming into our country we should also direct attention to the locations where they are settling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The problem is related to the overall disposition of our population and to the declining quality of life of Australians and <span class="highlight">migrants</span> alike. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before I get to the specific questions 1 wish to ask of the Minister on this measure I shall refer in passing to the matters that were directed to me personally by the honourable member for Boothby  (Mr Mclean who described my comments in relation to some <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the community as quite asinine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister whether he has directed his attention to the absorption centres in Israel which has taken in more <span class="highlight">migrants</span> per capita than any other nation in the world, lt has taken people - starting at the top - from rural, professional and urban walks of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These surveys related not only to adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span> but also to migrant children in the schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In late 1967 and early 1968 the Department initiated the planning of a major survey of the educational needs of both adult and child <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, and this led to the report on the situation of migrant children in schools in New South Wales which has provided such an important basis for the new initiatives for child migrant education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complementary studies were undertaken at the same time by my Department which again studied the abandonment rate from continuation classes and the special needs of migrant women and adolescent <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These surveys, together with experience gathered over the years, have led to the current policy of developing accelerated forms of instruction to supplement the long term continuation programme and the need for specialisation through courses of instruction orientated towards the particular needs of individual groups of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the States have had the responsibility for bearing the cost of servicing the social infrastructure required by <span class="highlight">migrants</span> on their early arrival in Australia, it is fair to report that to this stage no State government in Australia has in fact called for a reduction of the migrant intake in its particular State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Batman  (Mr Garrick)  referred particularly to the needs of adolescent <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and the older <span class="highlight">migrants</span> confined to their homes - both groups lacking formal education - and he indicated that he believed that the situational method of teaching English was ill-suited to the needs of these particular groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> should be instructed in their own language, in their own cultures and be taught in classes of their own nationality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure the honourable member that the teaching techniques used by my Department are by no means confined to the situational method, though the basic advantages of this method, which is recognised as of international standing, are such that it does allow <span class="highlight">migrants</span> of any number of different nationalities to be taught in one class by one teacher who does not necessarily need to know their languages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Australia’s quarantine measures are based on the knowledge that foot and mouth disease is continually present in these countries and full precautions are always taken to guard against <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and visitors from these countries bringing foot and mouth disease into Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-43-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, skilled <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are doomed to be rent payers all their lives because their rents will prevent their saving money to be home owners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would add the comment, by way of illustration, that if the Government brings in 175,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> again it inevitably puts upon the States the duty of making available classroom space and teachers for the children, more hospital accommodation, more housing, more transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has provided also entry of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to the Australian work force at an earlier time and has saved those <span class="highlight">migrants</span> travelling by air unavoidable personal expenses which accompany sea travel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710223_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Rather than extend the old agreement for which there was provision under its Article 23, the Government decided to negotiate a new and more broadly based agreement which would: (a) give expression to the entitlements and obligations of all Maltese citizens who migrate to and settle in Australia; (b) make the agreement consistent with the basic provisions of recent agreements concluded with other migrant source countries - for example, Italy, Turkey and Yugoslavia; and (c) take account of substantive machinery modifications agreed upon between Australia and Malta late in 1969 in regard to financial arrangements and eligibility criteria for assisted Maltese <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710223_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Agreement provides for advice to Maltese <span class="highlight">migrants</span> on the acceptance of vocational qualifications in Australia and records that the Australian Government will endeavour to advance the acceptance of Maltese qualifications within the framework of Australian laws,’ regulations and practices; the rights of Maltese settlers as residents and as workers are set out, and that Australia undertakes” to extend to Maltese workers and their families the facilities available in Australia ‘ for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to learn English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710223_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The population of Malta is not large - some 325.600 people as at mid- 1970 - and it would be unrealistic  10  expect very large numbers of: <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in relation to the- total Australian migration programme’,  but- in terms of the Maltese population it is’- a very welcome movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710223_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the Government will have to look seriously at whether our immigration quota is too large to allow our urban development programmes to adapt to the rapid population increase, although, as the honourable member for Hunter  (Mr James)  has mentioned, the incidence of crime amongst <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is much lower than in the Australian born population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710317_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although the basie purpose of assisted passage migration programmes is to encourage people to come to Australia who will contribute to economic and social development, Government policy admits also of the need to take into account the na’tural desire of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to have parents join them in Australia As well as the humanitarian grounds on which this is based there are also practical considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-24-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has come from the Ustashi, from <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to this country who supported Hitler and Mussolini in the breakup of Yugoslavia and maybe also from similar <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to this country who supported Hitler in the break-up of Czechoslovakia a couple of years earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Immigration pointed out to me in a reply to a question that occasionally European parents working in Asian and Pacific countries wished to send their children to school in Australia while they are still too young for entry as <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>(a) In none of the Agreements mentioned above is any provision made regarding an annual intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from the country with which the Agreement is made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(i) The <span class="highlight">migrants</span> selected under the Agreements cover a wide cross-section of employment classifications (skilled, semiskilled, unskilled) but in none of the Agreements are employment classifications stipulated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">migrants</span> actually selected are in accordance with Australia’s known labour demands as determined annually in consultation with the Department of Labour and National Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None of the Agreements, except that with Turkey, has a provision defining age groups for assisted <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pose the question: How can it possibly be that such a desirable and fine group of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are not permitted to obtain visas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, the 3 bases on which we adjudge whether <span class="highlight">migrants</span> of non-European descent should be permitted to come in are, first of all, that they should be assimilable because we want one Australian community and we do not want little enclaves that can cause us the kind of trouble that has been caused in other parts of the world; secondly, we want them to have the kind of qualification that is necessary to permit them to fit readily into the work structure of this country; and finally, we want to be sure that they will make a contribution to our development as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has had the virtues of allowing us to build up and sustain an industrial base in Australia and in the years since World War II to sustain a large inflow of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What the honourable member has not explained is where the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> would find jobs.. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">migrants</span> depend absolutely on work in secondary industries for their survival. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the’ Minister for Immigration: Are all “ <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are British subjects given the same opportunity to apply foi and be granted Australian citizenship? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For particular groups within the community, such as Aboriginals, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and handicapped children, the education system is a one-way street to frustration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does this provision apply not only to naturalised <span class="highlight">migrants</span> but also in cases where children of Australian parents who are overseas on business or as tourists, are born outside Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-14">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> resent the provision and feel that they are second-class citizens and treated differently to Australians born in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-14">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There has been .no indication of resentment by many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in relation to the provisions in question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department very rarely receives applications for entry as <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from such persons; and the circumstances of each case would need to be studied; but in general where polygamous marriages are still continuing the parties would not be eligible for entry to Australia as <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to have overlooked completely the subsidised health insurance scheme under which the Commonwealth pays Commonwealth and fund benefits - both benefits - in respect of low income earners, persons on the unemployment benefit, persons receiving the sickness benefit, and <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that the reduced immigration programme for this year will provide an opportunity, as I said in my statement on the size of the programme, to extend and develop our welfare and education activities amongst <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the State branches of my Department there are social workers who look after the interests of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, and there are translator and interpreter services provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government also pays for social workers in community organisations which work amongst the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of explanation I refer to the Minister’s statement advising  that the Government has decided to reduce the immigration programme by 30,000 next year, reducing the target to 140,000 settlers, including 100,000 assisted <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and at least 40,000 unassisted <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is, it prompted by the failure to attract <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, by economic considerations associated with the former Prime Minister’s statement on the state of the economy, or by recent public demands for an inquiry into and curtailment of the programme? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The continuing economic buoyancy in Europe and other factors which influence migration make the prospects for obtaining suitable <span class="highlight">migrants</span> during 1971-72 less favourable than in the immediate past, if we insist, as we must, on maintaining an acceptable standard of selection and a reasonable national balance in the programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In relation to the latter part of the honourable gentleman’s question, that is as to where savings in costs will be made, what countries will be involved and so on, the final details have not been worked out, but I. am in a position to say to the honourable  gentleman that broadly there will be a proportionate percentage cut across the board from all the source countries from which we take <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that the Italian Under-Secretary for Immigration,  Mr Bemporad,  during a recent visit to Australia said that many provisions of the Immigration Agreement between Australia and Italy were inadequate and provided little security for Italian <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and requested that it should be brought up to date? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-37-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Hie Italian Government confirmed its willingness to co-operate in the teaching of English to prospective <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and responded favourably to the Australian request that Italian Labour Offices assist with the distribution of pamphlets to prospective <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, informing them of the possibilities open to them for learning English as well as about working and living conditions they will find upon their arrival in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-37-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have the doubtful distinction of having one of the worst and lowest scales of social benefits in the world, and if one looks at the figures for naturalisation it will be found that it is the main reason for the abysmally low percentage of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have applied for naturalisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another area which is not of such great significance but which is a constant cause of annoyance, especially to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, is the fact that there is no second class mail rate for air mail to continential countries, including the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Similarly, it has been accepted that this control, if it is to be exercised effectively, necessitates suitable provision for the encouragement by the Government of the types of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> which Australia needs and who either could not or would not come here without this encouragement and assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Had assisted migration been restricted to sponsored cases in 1970-71, instead of 120,000 assisted <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, Australia would have received fewer than 33,000 assisted <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To suggest that the role of the Commonwealth Government should be confined to assisting <span class="highlight">migrants</span> sponsored by friends or relatives already here, or even to abandon assisted migration totally, is worse than foolish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would, as the figures 1 quoted earlier showed, restrict the flow of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in source, in numbers and in skills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are a significantly young group; overall, the average age was only  23.3  years compared with an average age of  30.9  years for the Australian population <span class="highlight">Migrants</span> in fact contribute disproportionately to the support of both the youth of Australia and our aged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, some critics would have us believe that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are ‘costing’ us more than they contribute and that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> lower our living standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will find it harder and harder to get <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to come to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The subsidised health benefits plan which has been in existence since January 1970 provides assistance, in meeting the cost of medical and hospital treatment, to persons receiving unemployment, sickness and special social service benefits, to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> during their first 2 months in Australia and to low income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential, therefore, that persons who believe they are entitled to subsidised health benefits should make application to the Department of Social Services or, in the case of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, to the Department of Health as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Today it is fashionable to knock immigration, and the critics of our immigration policy point to the demands which the immigration programme makes on the economy and the additional amount of money which has to be spent on roads, schools, hospitals and sewerage systems because of the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> which we as a government have brought to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The latest information that I have been able to obtain indicates that whilst <span class="highlight">migrants</span> represent only 18 per cent of the total population they provide more than  23  per cent of the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The critics of Australia’s immigration policy base most of their criticism on the demand for capital which they claim is aggravated by our intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The critics ignore the fact that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> themselves contribute a great deal to our supply of capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the extent that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> through their work contribute to the profits made by the companies which employ them they also contribute to the capital which is not paid out in dividends but which is ploughed back into the businesses, and the industries which they help to develop also attract overseas capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst on the subject of migration I would like to say that 1 favour the portability of pensions with respect to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who wish to return to their native land, provided of course that proper safeguards could be worked out so that elderly people would not come to Australia merely to qualify for an age pension and then return to their own country after qualifying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The figures provided to him about the number of people who had enrolled or who had received assistance under the scheme were in 3 categories: Firstly, low income earners; secondly, recipients of unemployment and sickness benefits; and thirdly, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> within 2 months of arrival. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the figures also show that 82,000 recipients of unemployment, sickness and special benefits were enrolled under the scheme up to 30th June 1971 and that 28,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> became members of funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member should know, the fact is that a very large proportion of the recipients of unemployment and sickness benefits and, indeed, a proportion of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> also, are in the low income category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I know that the Commonwealth Statistician, who publishes the figures for settler departures from Australia, does not distinguish between assisted and non-assisted <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say on this general question of the departure of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Australia that the figures for 1970-71 recently published by the Commonwealth Statistician which show that about 28,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> left Australia or stated that they were leaving Australia permanently, have to be seen against the very high level of immigration that we have had in the last 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have taken into this country over 500,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the 3-year period up to the end of 1970-71; so we would have expected with that very high level of migration that the number of people departing would in fact increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Similarly, in a 12 months period <span class="highlight">migrants</span> on the average would be in Australia for only 6 months and their annual income would also be less than the limit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the year ended 30th June 1971, 82,000 unemployment, sickness and special beneficiaries became members of health insurance funds, about 11,000 low income families became members and about 28,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> became members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand, the Government extended the recommendations of the Nimmo Committee to cover persons receiving unemployment, sickness or special benefits through the Department of Social Services and to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> during their first 2 months in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I am revolted when I read their statements to the effect that we have to keep this programme going because we need <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to work in a particular form of industry because Australian workers will not work in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The subsidised health benefits plan, which has been in existence since January 1970, provides assistance in meeting the cost of medical and hospital treatment to persons receiving unemployment, sickness and special social service benefits, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> during their first 2 months in Australia and low income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is essential therefore that persons who believe they are entitled to subsidised pharmaceutical benefits should make application to the Department of Social Services or, in the case of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, to the Department of Health as soon as the changes become effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Politically I do not mind because all that these advertisements do is confirm the fact - and it is a fact - that this Government is more concerned with conscripting young <span class="highlight">migrants</span> than it is with helping the needy <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, in the case of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, only 1 in 4 of those arriving last year was registered in the Government scheme by fully, enrolling with a private benefits organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are most likely to have been the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from English speaking countries who made up one half of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> arriving in Australia in the June quarter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Regardless of the subsidised medical scheme, 1 estimate that probably 80 per cent of Greek, Italian and Turkish <span class="highlight">migrants</span> arriving over the last 18 months have not been covered either in the subsidised scheme or in the benefits insurance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Health of a Metropolis’, said that their survey of Prahran in the last few years showed that cultural factors were a massive influence alongside the family’s low income status in preventing these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from protecting themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Thus any improvement for the 2 months eligibility of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> - during which period they are probably healthiest of all - will be virtually of no significance as a means of enrolling certain groups of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the benefits scheme and of protecting them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet even if we were able to include every newcomer into the health benefits system, we would still be faced with the fundamental question which demands investigation by no less important a body than a select committee of this House: that is, what sort of problems do the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> arriving have, and how well are we meeting them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fundamental questions of the quality and availability of health care for the Australian people and, in particular, for such groups as <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, have to be made subordinate to the question of the cost of care and the primary question here is the cost of insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A knowledge of English is not a prerequisite for entry, though intending <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who wish to follow their normal occupation in which a knowledge of English is essential would generally be expected to have some fluency, in the language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some critics are inclined to blame <span class="highlight">migrants</span> for all the shortages in housing, services, education and other facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> have added to these problems certainly but, at the same time, they have in their way contributed to our prosperity and well being with their labour, skills and purchasing power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Government whether employment in the present economic climate is not a cause of concern with the continued intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Education authorities clamour for financial support yet we continue to bring in thousands of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, adding to the congestion and the difficulties of the system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not criticise the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> for coming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this situation supports an inquiry to decide whether in this atmosphere we should bring <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in and continue on the present basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable members know, the situation is that about 80 per cent of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> which come from non-English speaking countries desire some form of assistance in relation to education and language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is where the scheme has failed and not so much with the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are just a few of the problems which make some of the people think it is time for a ‘migrant holiday’ because the continued inflow of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is preventing us from overtaking the needs of education, housing, transport and capital works. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People know what I am saying about the need to have an inquiry to see whether we are correctly treating the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are here and those who are coming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One aspect is in relation to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have what is termed a working holiday; that is those who return after the 2-year period has expired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, it indicates that one in four English <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who arrived in the past year returned to Great Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Almost 700 permanent <span class="highlight">migrants</span> a week left Australia to return to Great Britain in July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, such a committee as that suggested might well make recommendations on establishments overseas, assisted passages, integration, selection of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, unassisted migration, accommodation centres, hostels and housing, publicity and eligibility for social services, to mention a few. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could only do good for the Department, the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each of us in our own way realises the contributions that our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have made to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children born in Australia were always the first <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from whatever source are to be encouraged, against that background. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the Leader of the Opposition now proposes that Government activities in the search for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> should be reduced and replaced by spontaneous applications and sponsorship from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that those areas where governments search for and find <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will no longer act as the source they have been in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thtre could hardly be a more effective way to cut European migration than by cutting the Government’s activity in its search for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, to allow sponsorship of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to rest with Australian residents who sponsor families and friends - from whatever country - and with well-known pyramid effects, will be disastrous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people are no longer <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the 2-i million <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have come here since the Second World War are part of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these days when it is fashionable to blame <span class="highlight">migrants</span> for every ill in the community, it might be just as well to place on record that if Australia ever closes its door to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> we will indulge in cultural incest and nothing but decadence will result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a proper questioning in the community about the numbers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to this country and about all aspects of a policy that was in fact launched by our Party and has been carried on for a quarter of a century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has cut down the vote for migrant education in such a way as to impose hardships on <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it pathetic when I am speaking on behalf of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier this week the Government announced a deferment of the arrival of 3,000 migrant workers and their families in order to assist some of those who are currently registered for employment to obtain jobs which the Government believes may otherwise be taken by <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could have selected any other 5 countries to make a comparison with Australia but I chose Canada and New Zealand as countries of immigration, Japan and the United Kingdom as countries of intense manufacturing industry and as countries which have not increased their population through migration, and I chose the United States of America both as  a  highly intensive manufacturing country and as a country which still attracts <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in reasonable numbers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interesting thing is that in each of the years between 1966 and 1969  -  these were the only years for which the Library research service was able to provide comparative figures - Australia’s intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as a percentage of the population was higher than that of the other 5 countries with the exception of Canada in the years 1966 and 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because <span class="highlight">migrants</span> constitute a higher percentage of the work force relative to their total population than does the rest of the community they contribute substantially to taxation revenue and help to spread public expenditure on certain items - for example, defence - over a larger number of taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because <span class="highlight">migrants</span> contribute to expanding Australian production they encourage foreign investment and by their savings, which are higher than the average, they contribute substantially to domestic capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Referring to the impact which <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have come to Australia under the Government’s immigration policy have, he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>State and municipal authorities in the cities where overwhelmingly <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have settled has become starkly apparent <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the policy which has resulted in <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, who comprise 18 per cent of the total population, providing 23 per cent of the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s chief role should lie in the assistance not the search for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if the Government is concerned with fighting inflation - the Leader of the Opposition has on many occasions also expressed his concern about inflation - its chief role should be to search for skilled <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who can contribute to our technical knowledge and who can, because they represent a higher percentage of the work force than the overall Australian population, help to reduce costs by producing more than they consume. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia welcomes these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> not only because of their skills and the opportunities that they give us for development of our capacity to defend ourselves and to play our part in aid in <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the cost associated with <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, I have never bothered to take out these figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before concluding I wish to refer to a matter which specifically affects <span class="highlight">migrants</span> although it is not strictly within the administration of the Department of Immigration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the expectation of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in respect of social services, the availability of social service benefits including the age pension to naturalised Australians who have established eligibility; in other words, they have lived here for at least  10  years and have been taxpayers during that period, and should receive a pension irrespective of where they live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are probably aware that almost every national group of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this country is running a campaign to obtain transferability of pensions which has been accepted by most other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I realise that I am not dealing with a function of the Department of Immigration, but surely it is concerned about the way <span class="highlight">migrants</span> look at Australia and their expectations, whether they feel that Australia is giving them a fair go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure the honourable member for Griffith that if he were in contact with <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in his own electorate, instead of attending meetings of young Liberals exclusively, he would know that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> do feel strongly about social service benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To summarise, let us not accept as factual the belief of those people who blame a whole host of modern problems on <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, thereby providing a unique Australian analysis of problems that in fact characterise most advanced industrialised societies, most- of which do not have immigration programmes, anyway, as the honourable member for Henty  (Mr Fox)  pointed out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not commit ourselves to this idea of blaming <span class="highlight">migrants</span> for these ills without conducting a thorough examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The possible relationship between these problems and <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is a thoroughly Australian problem and it is often useless looking to other countries for answers, as many people do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our policy has been based on the ability of our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to assimilate, to become part of our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Children born in Australia were always the first <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from whatever source are to be encouraged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The immigration programme’ consists essentially of an  i  in migration target,  announced  annually by the Commonwealth Government, and assorted schemes for assisting <span class="highlight">migrants</span> by paying all or part of’ their fares to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In supporting the need for a parliamentary committee I shall quote just one example that shows why today <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are less willing to come to Australia or if they come, to remain in Australia after their 2-year contract period has concluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This committee revealed that one of the main factors affecting the attraction of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia and their decision to remain here was Australia’s social welfare programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In discussing the importance of social services as a factor in attracting <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, the Committee accepted that: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>although they would not deliberately weigh them, many potential <span class="highlight">migrants</span> would take social services into account in assessing whether they would, in total, gain materially by coming to Australia <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the level of benefits in Australia, especially the existence of the means test in relation to some benefits, could give an impression that the Australian system compared unfavourably with those to which the potential <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were accustomed <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>questions that probably entered into <span class="highlight">migrants</span>’ minds would include the gap in cover between the time of departure from home countries and eligibility under Australian schemes; and the residential requirement before full benefits could apply (e.g., widows’ pensions) which had much greater impact on <span class="highlight">migrants</span> than upon Australians generally <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">migrants</span> immediately after arrival frequently suffered from inability to join an appropriate benefit organisation either because of lack of knowledge of how to proceed or through lack of cash income to afford the payments involved <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee therefore expressed a strong doubt that social services in Australia could be considered as a positive factor in the attraction of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I pay my tribute to the voluntary workers who assist <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the often difficult task of settling down in a new country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been a vital part of the success of our immigration programme that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> be regarded and treated in all respects as human beings, not merely as statistics in terms of population growth or increased work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> and their children, including their Australian born children, have over the years played a significant part in our national development and have made a mighty contribution in the industrial field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the current economic situation I believe the Government has acted wisely in reducing the flow of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and in endeavouring to place emphasis on quality rather than quantity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A ministerial statement of 23rd April 1970 set out details of improved and expanded measures for the education of child and adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span> following a survey of schools and discussions with State education authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When I refer to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, I mean European <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to that, in another sector of the electorate I represent there is a very large percentage of British <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has treated the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to this country as second class citizens and as a result of lack of policy on the part of the Government a largs percentage of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> that are brought to this country in fact live far below the poverty line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has not the Government legislated to provide a subsidised medical health scheme for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who come into this country as a sort of a stop-gap measure to make up for some of the conditions which they have left behind so far as that particular national aspect is concerned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since migration was introduced into this country, 70 per cent of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have settled in cities, most of them in capital cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us deal with naturalisation of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who come  to  this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because the Government regards <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as people who ought to be treated in a sub-standard manner with regard  to  social security and other conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the honourable member that I regard <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in my electorate as being human beings- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the second generation of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> cannot be regarded in the manner in which the Government regards them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is wrong with the concept of inquiry and planning with respect to population growth and the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> that this country will be able to accept in future years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot afford to permit to continue the return of a large percentage of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to the United Kingdom and to other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although <span class="highlight">migrants</span> comprised 18.3 per cent of Australia’s total population, and 25.3 per cent of the total work force in 1966  -  and these proportions are most probably higher today - so far we have avoided any major clashes, the build up of ethnic groups in ghettoes or the development of racial disharmony and tensions in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said in the Estimates debate last year I believe that the broad lines for selection of immigrants should be on quality, not quantity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also applaud the Government for taking a more conservative attitude in respect of the intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and hope that selection procedures will be appropriately stringent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite what members of the Opposition have said, there is no doubt as to where this Government stands in relation to the criteria used for the selection of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, or of the results of the applications of these criteria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The emphasis will change from, though sot necessarily entirely take the place of, Governnent search for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Government assistance far those already here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is also a fact that nominated <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have produced less than a quarter of the skilled and semi-skilled workers who have come to Australia in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me quote what the honourable member for Capricornia  (Dr Everingham)  wrote in the Fabian Newsletter’ of August 1970 in an article entitled: ‘Why Pay for White <span class="highlight">Migrants</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To achieve that end one of the prime factors in the selection of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> must always be to . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, 1 am quite certain that the principles I have outlined will find favour with the large majority of the people of Australia; but, of course, for Australia to abide by and carry out those principles requires the certainty that we have the unfettered right to regulate the intake of our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> at all times and also have a complete right of selection and rejection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it seems to me that, as we have had the foresight and, no doubt to some extent, the good fortune to attract and retain <span class="highlight">migrants</span> of very good standard, in most respects anyway - after all, we cannot expect to be 100 per cent successful, but in the main our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have made very good citizens - it is reasonable, desirable and wise that we continue to obtain our future requirements from the same sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Entry of suitable <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is to be encouraged but is to be strictly regulated so as not to impose an undue strain on the Australian economy or to imperil full employment or Australian industrial conditions through over-competition for available work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should examine the system of granting assisted passages to ascertain to what extent we are gaining long term or permanent residents as against those who use that concession as a holiday or tourist scheme to the detriment of genuine <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has been aware of the necessity to keep a steady flow of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to this country, but it has not been engaged upon a blind and mindless pursuit of numbers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ours is a nation that has been built up by <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and we have not yet ceased to build. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may come a time when we no longer need to build and when we no longer need <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has a good name as a country where <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are well accepted and taken into the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>of which I had the privilege of being a member, to Turkey, Yugoslavia, Ireland and England revealed that Australia was regarded as being most acceptable to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from those areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in turn must see that we are getting good types of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who will be assimiliated quickly and will be able to make a contribution to the skill of the trade or vocation in  which they have been trained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be able to get first class <span class="highlight">migrants</span> along these lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One must realise, of course, that difficulties arise in obtaining <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from European countries when the - economic situation of those countries improves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt in my mind that we should be careful about drastically cutting our intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ‘has been said that cutting Australia’s intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> would assist in combating inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cutting Australia’s intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> would do nothing to reduce inflation, and was a backward step for the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some time ago legislation was introduced in this Parliament relating to education in English of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to draw to the attention of the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Lynch),  who is at the table, a weakness which was pointed out at the time and which I think is seriously restricting the value of that proposition, that is, the fact that the Commonwealth does not accept any responsibility to provide buildings for the teaching of English to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know of a case where the location of one suitable building in an area in which there is a large number of schools could have provided, and would provide, an adequate service for the teaching of English to adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After a teacher at one school had received the necessary training it was found that that school could not take her off normal teaching duties with the result that the teaching of English to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> at that school had to cease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it would bc of particular value in the inner metropolitan areas where very substantial numbers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> attend schools and in some of the larger provincial centres where there has been a large migrant settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is very important for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> - especially to the younger ones coming to this country - to obtain as quickly as possible and under the best possible conditions a knowledge of English which will enable them to proceed with their education and employment with as short an interruption as is possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I sympathise wilh the British people for the horrible mess which successive British governments have created by opening the floodgates to African, Indian and Caribbean <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A balanced annual intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> would fit easily into the mainstream of life in the present Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I represent what is probably the largest concentration of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia, and nobody can blame them for that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>or longer - I visit as many of the school: as possible and speak to the people who are involved with <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my own mind I have the feeling that if we suddenly reduce the intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> we might create unemployment; that in fact the pressures (hat immigration creates might well be some of those that have created full employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They can be the children of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have settled in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is better to retain control of immigration as this Government has done, to be able to draw back the numbers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> rather than to be confronted with a flood of people over which there can be no control concerning race, colour of skin or nationality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the policy of the Australian Labor Party were implemented little could be done to stop the flow of these people, so with 50,000 Indians coming into Australia - or 50,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> of any nationality - they, their spouses and children would represent 100,000 to 150,000 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the last 2 years the Government has permitted into this country 20,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> of mixed or non-European blood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one does a little arithmetic one sees that the Government’s policy is to have a non-European population content of 500,000 immigrants by the year 2000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that some <span class="highlight">migrants</span> purchasing Government cottages occupied by them since their arrival are being grossly exploited in the prices being charged, the high interest rates and the conditions of purchase set by the Department of the Interior? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But if the honourable gentleman were to quote all that I said and not just the parts which he feels would suit the purposes of his question, he would know that I went on to say that it was essential as a policy objective not to have <span class="highlight">migrants</span> arriving immediately prior to the Christmas close-down period in industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second part of the amendment is obviously an implication that the Qantas management has not been able, to the satisfaction of the honourable member for Newcastle and his colleagues, to manage effectively that great company in relation to air crews, the passage of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, charters and fares throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that our Department of Immigration has 318 people looking after the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> that we are trying to get not only from Great Britain but also from Europe, but even in that area only approximately 100 of these people are Australian based personnel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In most cases they refer to settled countries and settled communities where there is not an influx of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> of varying ages which makes the adoption of such a scheme difficult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The members of the Federation of Netherlands Societies in New South Wales in General Meeting noted with much regret the unrest amongst <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and Australians alike caused by the absence of an adequate system of social services in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The absence of a feeling of security is one of the main reasons why so many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> return to the country of their birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This could very well be the reason why <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are returning home; perhaps one could work out the cost of that and do a nice statistical exercise on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At question time this morning I told the House that if my recollection of the figures concerning the number of students and teachers in the programme of assistance to child <span class="highlight">migrants</span> was not correct I would advise the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We still hear the same speeches by the same persons who say we need to have a heavily protected industry so that we can provide employment for our <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have problems with <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as well as with Aborigines, deserted wives and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One important such group is southern European <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, who are under represented amongst those in public housing accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This situation obtains even though there is no discrimination against these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the allocation of public housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The explanation of the situation is to be found in the fact that these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are heavily dependent upon their ethnic sub-culture and are 18th to be dispersed indiscriminately within public housing areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">migrants</span> find strong social needs to live amongst their extended families, friend* ft om their former village, ethnic shopping facilities, theatres and clubs, and to accept public housing would involve the breaking of these many social bonds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Southern European <span class="highlight">migrants</span> want public assistance with their housing problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this second approach is accepted, it would be necessary to research the housing problems of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in some depth - this has not been done in this legislation or in other  legislation  by this Commonwealth Government - with a view to formulating mechanisms whereby assistance can be provided for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Melbourne poverty survey found that high repayments for housing was an extremely important factor in precipitating <span class="highlight">migrants</span> into poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further important factor in migrant housing is that southern European <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have made a very important contribution to the renewal of inner suburban areas, through extensive renovation of the housing stock and the shopping centres, and have also halted the population decline in those areas; but this has led them into assuming considerable financial burdens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ask: Why is the Commonwealth housing authority, in co-operation with the States, not used to purchase already existing terrace housing in inner suburban areas, particularly the inner suburban areas of Sydney and Melbourne, for renovation and letting, leasing or sale to immigrants or other people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first part of his amendment he proposes that the Commonwealth Government provide the States with adequate funds to enable them to meet the special housing needs of low income earners, pensioners, <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, Aborigines and deserted wives and similarly disadvantaged people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Western Australia, for instance, needs more finance to provide adequately for the housing needs of those on lower incomes, for those on pensions, for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and for others, as is proposed in the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some employer organisations had been very active recruiting bricklayers and 720 assisted <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were brought here in the years 1966 to 1970 inclusive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> entering the State of Western Australia is high in proportion to the population and this places an added burden on the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In his amendment, the honourable member for Reid has made special mention of lower income earners, pensioners, <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, Aborigines, deserted wives and similar disadvantaged people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Where is the concern of the Government shown for the low income earners, the pensioners, the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, the Aborigines, the deserted wives and the similarly disadvantaged people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With respect to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, honourable members will see that already they have a scheme which is available and which actively varies according to the level of migrant intake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>percentage of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Britain who in each of the last 5 years have permanently returned to Britain had received assisted passages after (i) direct application in Britain or (ii) nomination from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-45-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This year in the September quarter the figure will be 36,000, despite the fact that 300,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have come into the country and there have been 212,000 marriages in the meantime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Applicants for assisted passages are requiredto meet even more exacting criteria, including higher physical and medical standards, but generally the consequences are that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> on arrival are free of disabilities which would make them unemployable or lead to such deterioration of health as would require prolonged institutional care or medical attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-9-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Normally therefore there are no special medical checks required or imposed on <span class="highlight">migrants</span> after arrival in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-9-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition to these measures, under State legislation all <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are required to undergo chest X-ray within one month of arrival in Australia unless this condition is waived by the State Director of Tuberculosis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-9-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report is so abbreviated from the Hansard that it gives the impression that I was criticising the actual <span class="highlight">migrants</span> themselves when in fact the Hansard shows I was requesting an inquiry into the matter of hardship, housing and employment security and an assurance on these matters to be given to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Members of the Australian Labor Party are particularly aware of the deficiencies of our welfare services as they affect <span class="highlight">migrants</span> because most <span class="highlight">migrants</span> live in electorates represented by members of the Australian Labor Party in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I had previously pointed out how belated and dilatory was the Government’s approach to this question of social services not only for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> but also for Australian bom men and women who choose to live overseas and who thereupon lose the social benefits which they had earned by working and, therefore inevitably, by paying taxes in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party’s campaign to reduce the qualifying period from 20 to 10 years for age pensions succeeded in making  Mr Menzies,  as he still was, say in the 1961 election campaign that it was unreasonable that elderly <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who had worked and paid taxes in Australia for lengthy periods should not qualify for age pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second principle should be to endeavour to preserve the rights of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia who are not enjoying in Australia the full rights that they would have acquired in those other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second is that we should preserve in Australia the rights of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have come with pension rights, which they might otherwise lose, from their own country overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The groups of elderly <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who would want to go abroad are predominantly those who have not applied for Australian citizenship and therefore this Bill will not help those who are really most in need of this kind of help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I  (4) In the case of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> lt is necessary to take into consideration that the total figures for migrant settlers do not represent the number of persons entitled to be enrolled in the Subsidised Health Benefits Flan because in the case of families, enrolment by the head of the family provides Subsidised Health Benefits entitlements for the whole of the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The numbers of single persons and of family groups of particular sizes are available for assisted <span class="highlight">migrants</span> but in the case of unassisted <span class="highlight">migrants</span> the figures used in this answer represent an estimate recently made by the Department of Immigration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The need for the review was referred to in the Government’s announcement of new initiatives in migrant education in April 1970 which foreshadowed also a transfer in emphasis to more accelerated and specialised forms of instruction which would be better suited to the needs of individual groups of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720411_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-34-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the defects - by no means the only defect - of the Bill on this subject recently presented to the House by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  - if I may say so, with respect, an incompetent Bill which scarcely reflects the legal talents which one would have expected my honourable and learned friend to have displayed - was that it was entirely confined to ‘Australian citizens’, and thus constituted a slap in the face for some of the most hard-working and worthy of our <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Second, we wanted to ensure in negotiation the greatest possible reciprocal benefits for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from other countries who live in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are all Australian taxpayers if we are permanently resident here, whether we are Australian born, or whether we came originally from overseas; and all of us, including <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, have an interest in seeing that the Australian Treasury is not thus pillaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, this is the principle which <span class="highlight">migrants</span> themselves have endorsed in their journals: They say, very rightly, that those who have earned their pension by their contribution to the Australian scene should, by virtue of that contribution, have the right to take their pension home, lt is for this reason that, with the exceptions for invalids and widows, we have prescribed a qualifying period of 20 years - which is more generous, for example, than what is done in Canada, where the qualifying period is 25 years for portability of the old age security pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope and expect that well before the commencement of the next sittings, negotiations will be concluded with a large number of these countries, including those which are most important from the viewpoint of our <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill before the House, while not confined to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, is the latest of a series of measures introduced by this Government to assist <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have need of Australian social security in their widowhood, ill health or old age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, let me reiterate that the new provisions apply equally to all <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, whether naturalised or not, as well as to all Australians whether or not they are <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a Bill which can benefit both natural-born Australians, and the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have come here to settle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no reason to doubt any of the figures which are placed before me in relation to the employment of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as I am aware, there are adequate provisions for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the hostels in which they are received on arrival in Australia for it to be quite certain that they are well advised of the conditions which apply in the employment market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures I have at present indicate that throughout the March quarter of this year the numbers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in hostels awaiting initial job placement were substantially lower than the levels for the comparable period in  1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Between March  1971  and March  1972,  of course, the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in hostels showed a decline, but I am referring basically to the question of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if the honourable gentleman has a particular matter which is of concern to him, I would be more than happy to have it checked out, because I realise the Government’s heavy responsibility to ensure that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are brought to this country have adequate employment opportunities available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Procedures differ slightly from country to country but in general all intending unassisted <span class="highlight">migrants</span> other than British Europeans, and all intending assisted <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are required to complete an application form and a medical examination form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-21-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me that this organisation, Travel House of Australia Pty Ltd, in its business practices could very well be blamed for exploiting the position of many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this country who, wishing to return to their homes for short term visits, have sought the cheapest means of transport and accordingly used the sort of charter arrangements which organisations like Travel House of Australia seem to be able to provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Travel House of Australia having got its hands on the hard earned money of people in this community - many of them <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who want to visit their homes for quite understandable reasons, and who in my experience are moderate or low income earners and who have worked very hard to accumulate a little money with a long term saving aim of returning to their home - some of the people find that they cannot travel on the selected date because of personal reasons which are perfectly legitimate, perfectly understandable and quite unavoidable in regard to the need to cancel the trip. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>89 doctors engaged in screening overseas the health of prospective <span class="highlight">migrants</span> applied for and undertook language training during the years 1965-71 which represents 6J.5 per cent of the total number of doctors engaged for this purpose during the period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-47-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: Why did the Prime Minister feel it necessary to state his opposition to a policy which he said favoured southern European <span class="highlight">migrants</span> - I take it that he meant <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Italy, Malta, Spain, Greece, France and presumably southern Switzerland and Yugoslavia - bringing out their relatives and friends? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, will he reconsider his announced opposition to a priority for friends and relatives to be sponsored here and to chain migration, in the interests of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> themselves and of the community at large? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it would not be a saving if due to a decline in the prosperity of the economy, not as many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> arrived in Australia as the Government anticipates and therefore it would not have to spend so much on assisting those <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is obvious also that certain areas carry a heavier load of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and have  a  higher need for migrant education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Crash courses for adults are ineffective and, unless such special training for non-English speaking <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is started at pre-school level and carried right through the educational process, the efforts are ineffective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: Following the recent discussion on immigration, can the Minister assure the House that there will be no change in the Government’s policy of facilitating the reunion of families through sponsored immigration, while at the same time continuing the policy of Commonwealth sponsorship of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from countries from which there is no tradition of family sponsorship? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What that means, in so many words, is that if the Labor Party did what it says it will do we would get virtually no <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from northern Europe or from North America, and that the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> we would get from the United Kingdom would be cut by 60 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have investigated many allegations that the information given by, or the activities of, officers overseas have misled <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, and I have found that, after investigation, very few of them are well grounded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am also advised that there are many South American <span class="highlight">migrants</span> currently attending these courses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have talked to far too many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have fled from communist countries to have any illusions about those  countries  being a workers’ paradise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not have this right in communist countries; <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have come here from Iron Curtain countries will testify to this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another good example is the impact of one sub-system, migration, on the integrated urban system where <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have settled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not <span class="highlight">migrants</span> specifically but the increase in population growth from 1 per cent to 2 per cent caused by migration which is doing the damage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I pointed out earlier, about 90 per cent or more of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from the counties in western Europe which the Minister has designated as countries with which reciprocal agreements are now being sought have lived in Australia for less than 20 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the figures that I quoted for the first time today in the second reading debate on this Bill, the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have been in Australia for more than 20 years are, in 90 per cent or 95 per cent of cases, from eastern European countries - the countries which the Minister has not approached to arrange reciprocal agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Bill would never have been introduced but for my notice that I would be introducing a Bill on behalf of the Labor Party and but for my discussions over Christmas and last January with the governments of the main countries from which Australia draws <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have also quoted the letter which my colleague the honourable member for Grayndler had received from the United Council of Immigrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this Bill he wants to make captive pensioners out of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from what he calls captive nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall shortly give the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the Soviet Union, which incorporates Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and the Ukraine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many Turkish <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have been in Australia for 20 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party’s campaign to reduce the qualifying period from 20 to 10 years for age pensions succeeded in making  Mr Menzies,  as he then was, say in the 1961 election campaign that it was unreasonable that elderly <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who had worked and paid taxes in Australia for lengthy periods could not qualify for age pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the huge percentage of our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from our principal migrant source countries who will not receive benefits under this legislation, even if reciprocal agreements are achieved with their countries, because they have not been in Australia as residents for 20 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who in general have been in Australia for more than 20 years, who would be entitled to pensions under the Labor Party’s Bill but who will not be entitled to pensions under the McMahon Government’s Bill because there is no prospect of having agreements with those countries <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be seen by honourable members that the vast majority of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from these captive nations, as the Minister describes them, have been in Australia for more than 20 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The significance of all this is that Australia is not attracting as many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as it did and it is losing more <span class="highlight">migrants</span> than ever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It turns out that for the first 9 months of the present financial year 103,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> came to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to our shame we are suffering a very great degree of emigration by former <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same figures show that in the first 9 months of this financial year 24,492 former <span class="highlight">migrants</span> departed permanently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In March this year the number of former <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who departed permanently was 2,736 and in March last year it was 2,330. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Going through the individual countries, we see that to the major source countries - the ones that I have quoted - Australia is losing more <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in every successive month, or in each 9-month period, or in each financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who will be encouraged to come to and remain in Australia will be minute in terms of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this occasion, as on the occasion of the second reading of the Labor Party’s Bill, I have dealt principally with the rights of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be a matter of pride to Australia that so many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have come here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be a matter of shame to Australia that so many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are now leaving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has not chosen to answer today the charge that he brought into this House a Bill purporting to be in the interests of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, which sought to confine the granting or the portability of pensions to Australian citizens, thereby excluding a large number of very good <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to this country who have made a substantial contribution to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition has not answered the charge made by the Minister for Social Services that he brought into the House a Bill that would have precluded this country, through the mechanism of reciprocal agreements, from doing what it could in relation to Australian born residents of this country who wanted to go and live in other countries, and in relation to new <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to this country, to get through our negotiating position the best possible deal on the rights that those <span class="highlight">migrants</span> accrued in their countries of origin.. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in this process, as I have said and as the Minister for Social Services has said, the Opposition has advocated policies which even the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> themselves will see are against their own best long term interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He cannot have had much contact with the representatives of the captive nations who have come to this country if he believes that any <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from those countries will return to them, with or without a pension, while those countries remain under their present regimes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the fall in the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from countries from which we received a significant number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> since the last World War.. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He claimed on both occasions that ‘Australia is failing to attract <span class="highlight">migrants</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said - I repeat the phrase - that ‘Australia is failing to attract <span class="highlight">migrants</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the immigration policies of the Australian Labor Party advocate and require that the Commonwealth Government should withdraw from the search for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition has also said that, under a Labor government, fewer <span class="highlight">migrants</span> would come to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the immigration policies of the Australian Labor Party would mean significantly fewer <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to Australia from such countries as Italy, Greece, Yugoslavia and Malta. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it is because <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from those countries realise this - and the Leader of the Opposition has woken up to the fact that they realise it - that he has begun to become concerned about the migrant vote in the coming election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the reason why he has rushed in with these ill-thought proposals in relation to pensions - because the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> know that this will be the effect of the approach of the Australian Labor Party to migration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, in the face of the proposals of the Australian Labor Party in relation to migration, the honourable gentleman has the hide to say that he is now concerned that Australia is failing to attract <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To justify the assertion that Australia is failing to attract <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, the Leader of the Opposition quoted statistics by which he sought to compare the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from various countries last year with what he described as the peak year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Lebanon has fallen from 5,669– <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, the Leader of the Opposition said that the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Germany had fallen from 63,982 to 4,872. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also said - without quoting from any statistics - that there was also a drop in the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Yugoslavia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Measured against this very large settler element in our population and the fact that in the 3 years ended 30th June 1971 Australia received more than half a million <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, the figures quoted by the Leader of the Opposition retreat into their true perspective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He stated also that 311,952 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were eligible for naturalisation but had not been naturalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out also that the experience of the Department of Immigration gauged over 25 years of immigration was that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> generally waited more than 8 years before deciding to apply for citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also ignores the fact that the proportion of eligible <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who seek naturalisation in Australia compares more than favourably with the experiences pf other <span class="highlight">migrants</span> - receiving countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, there is no evidence to support his speculations as to the reasons why a percentage of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> hesitate to seek citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition has stated also that there is hesitation in recognising <span class="highlight">migrants</span>’ professional or trade qualifications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally I want to put in its proper context the suggestion that in providing for a 20-year residential period for portable pensions the Government is denying this facility to the great majority of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition quoted figures intended to establish that the great majority of Italian, Greek, Dutch, Yugoslav and German <span class="highlight">migrants</span> had been in Australia for less than 20 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the great majority of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to whom the Leader of the Opposition refers are some 30 to 35 years too young to receive an Australian age pension, either here or in their homelands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let me say to him at the outset that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia are not offended with the role of the Australian Labor Party or of the Opposition in this Parliament in the migration programme because they recognise that there probably would never have been an immigration programme had it not been initiated by this Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  has given information about the departure of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> which must present itself as a very worrying problem to every honourable member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When something like 22,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who came to Australia under assisted passages have returned home within 2 years, there are good reasons why we should look around for the causes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that it would be inappropriate for the simple reason that the Government wanted to engage in a window dressing process in this period preceding the election campaign to give the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> around Australia and those Australians who may be considering living abroad the idea that the Government at last was doing something positive about this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3) which does not offer anything tangible at all but which obviously is designed to mislead the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in particular and those Australians who may choose to live overseas in their retirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly the net result will be that some <span class="highlight">migrants</span> may come to enjoy the right of portability to the country to which they want to go while others, whose countries do not co-operate, will be denied it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the fact is that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who leave Australia, who have earned their pensions here, cannot have social security under the present arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague, the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam),  has referred to the contentions made by the United Council of Immigrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to do all that we can for those <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who come to Australia but who decide that they want to leave, at the same time not being unfair to the basic Australian taxpayer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition attempted to show by citing figures that because the bulk of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from other countries has arrived in Australia only in the last 20 years, therefore they would miss out under the Government’s proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole question is: What are the ages of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> upon their arrival in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever measure we use, the ages of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> on arrival in Australia make it quite clear that the overwhelming majority of all settlers in Australia, permanent or long term arrivals, involve people who are under the age of 45 years which would therefore place them in a position to take out the full benefits of the age provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second consideration of which the Government was mindful, according to the Minister, was the need to ensure in negotiation that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from other countries received the greatest possible reciprocal benefits from their countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To have such a cavalier attitude towards the rights of those who have earned their Australian pensions and have received less than justice all their lives is surely the mark of one who has scant regard for the welfare of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> or pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us be sure and understand that it is <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and pensioners about whom we are talking when we discuss this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hundreds of thousands of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have made Australia their homeland since the Second World War will welcome this Government legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have settled in the Murray electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Australia as a whole, many primary and secondary industries would not have been able to achieve the degree of excellence they have achieved without the contribution of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have spoken to a number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> about this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is that through the passage of this legislation and the reciprocal arrangements that will be made with other countries these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia will be provided with a better feeling of equality and status in this country because their own homeland will have negotiated, on an equal footing, a reciprocal agreement with Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly it will provide encouragement to these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to become more involved in our community because they will feel more a part of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any cost would be more than compensated by the fact that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have earned this right after having earned their livelihood in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be available to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who may not wish to return to their country of origin but who may wish to go to some other country with which we have a reciprocal agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is important both to our country and to the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> concerned thai reciprocal agreements be reached with their countries because only by reciprocity can this Government obtain the best deal for the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who would wish to move to another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, on the Leader of the Opposition’s own figures, one-third of all <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who come to Australia would be deprived of their rights of the Labor Party’s Bill which requires citizenship were passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The vast majority of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> would require at least 20 years after the time they came to Australia before they could qualify, not because of a residential qualification but simply because they have not reached old age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation will provide <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with a more equitable basis of portability than the alternative offered by the Labor Party would provide - if anybody can sort out which of the 2 approaches provided by the Labor Party in the last 3 months in this place is the one that it really means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This boils down to suggesting that 20 years is appropriate here because we would then be more generous than Canada, or that a 10~year residential requirement would not be enough to deter <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who were interested in coming to Australia for no other reason than to qualify for the age pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we wanted to ensure in negotiation the greatest possible reciprocal benefits for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from other countries who live in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is already clear from representations made in my own electorate that this is a matter of very great concern to many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from other than our major migration sources, and  1.  ask the Minister to indicate what action is being taken or is intended to be taken on their behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have come to Australia to seek a new life for their children, as they know that better opportunities exist in Australia, and even though they do not take out Australian citizenship, their children most certainly are Australians, as many have been born here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other reasons why <span class="highlight">migrants</span> do not take out Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Bill introduced by the Minister for Social Services every effort will be made to secure the greatest possible reciprocal payment for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from other countries who choose to live in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some instances it is possible for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from other countries to bring their pensions or portion of their pensions with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst on the subject I think it is a great pity more is not done to make our new settlers welcome, particularly the non English-speaking <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the postwar period 2.9 million <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have come to Australia to seek a new way of life and if it were not for the great work force they provide, we would have less of all those things we consider today to be so essential to our way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this were the case perhaps the approximate number of 20,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, which was referred to this afternoon, would not be returning to their countries of birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst on the subject of portability I want to mention one or two anomalies that apply to elderly <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who come to Australia from the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Channel Islands have no reciprocal agreement with Britain it means that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from these islands do not qualify for Australian pensions on arrival. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know there are other elderly <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who come to Australia to live with a son or daughter, and who do not qualify for an Australian pension until they have resided here for 10 years, lt is quite obvious that anyone over 80 years of age does not come to Australia just, to receive an Australian pension and then return to his or her country of birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would therefore like the Minister to take this matter up with his colleague, the Minister for Immigration  (Dr Forbes)  and give consideration to amending the Act with a view to paying the Australian pension to all <span class="highlight">migrants</span> over 80 years of age, after serving a qualifying period of 6 months, as applies to residents from the United Kingdom and New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I repeat that the Bill before the House is not confined to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> only - I have not heard this mentioned this afternoon - as Australian born citizens also will bc able to draw their pensions whilst living overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As previously mentioned, the new pensions will apply to all <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, whether naturalised or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst this Bill is a definite improvement to some extent, it is nevertheless a sleight of hand as it cannot really be effective unless reciprocal arrangements are made between Australia and the countries of origin of the various <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hard to understand, therefore, why this is insisted upon because although this legislation may be introduced and become law, it still will not at this point of time give anything to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who wish to return to their homelands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have been here for 10 years they receive their pensions and if they were made available to them under the portability arrangements it still would not cost the Government any more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>save the Government money by way of pension payments, so surely it would have been a reasonable proposition at this point of time to give to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who return to their homeland the same facilities as they receive here in Australia and the facilities which are offered in their homeland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first of these is that the benefits should be available to all <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and persons who fulfil the other prerequisites of the legislation and who come from countries with whom reciprocal arrangements have been concluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The act of renouncing citizenship of the country of one’s birth is a serious and often traumatic experience and I fully understand the reluctance of many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are all hopeful that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will eventually want to become naturalised citizens and participate fully in our community, but if they for their own good reasons do not wish to relinquish their original citizenship we should not seek to discriminate against them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second guiding principle is to ensure that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> do not lose out on any existing benefits through any unilateral action of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They invite us once again to become party to the abandonment of the interests of many immigrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this indicates quite clearly that the level of social services in Australia is high by comparison with the levels that apply in countries from which we get our <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As such, our social services may, in fact, be one of the things that will serve to attract <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, I might mention also that any <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who return home with their Australian pension at the latter part of their lives, living in some comfort on those payments, will in turn be very great ambassadors for Australia among their fellow countrymen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members on this side of the House see Australia’s <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as people with special interests that deserve our protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This results from the fact that the Government treats <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as individuals deserving to be treated as such whereas the Opposition sees them merely in terms of votes to be used for its own political advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What other explanation is there for the way in which the interests of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have been so shamefully relegated to oblivion by the Australian Labor Party? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, I want to state once again that this Bill represents a remarkable advance in terms both of our national social welfare system and in the special regard which we pay to the interests of our <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they had done that they would have revealed the old attitude which they adopt to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has been less than just to many of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have come here since the war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, this nation needed <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, lt wanted them to come, it encouraged them to come, and it has reaped the benefit of the labour of 2.5 million new people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tens of thousands of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> went into deep debt to bring even their wives and children to join them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They paid 20 per cent and 30 per cent interest on loans to bring their families with them, while some favoured categories of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> could hop on a plane and come here with ease and maximum help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have drawn <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from 50 countries, and there is a great range of discrimination practised between all of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>submit that the Government has  not  kept pace with the good will and unifying influence of the Australian people generally who have held out a helping hand and a welcoming hand to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principle has been established for 2 categories of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a second category of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> - the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from the United Kingdom and New Zealand who can return to their home towns with a pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there is a third category - the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from all other countries with whom reciprocity agreements have been concluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ff one of these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is 55 years old when he arrives in Australia, it means that at 75 years of age he will be able to take his pension and go to his home town in his country of origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fourth category include <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who come from a country which probably no longer exists or which, for one reason or another wish to sign a treaty of reciprocity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 want to say also that in contrast to this measure, other measures that have been enacted by other countries which are actively seeking <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have been so much more generous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier today the Leader of the Opposition made a great deal of fuss about our migration policies and the state of the economy in this country being such that we were no longer attracting <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition has been reported as saying that under Labor ‘fewer <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will come to Australia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But now because it is opportune to do so he has cited what the Government has set out purposely to do as an example of why this country is no longer attracting <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could say much more, because I have many thousands of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, including naturalised <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, in my electorate, but because it is intended to pass this Bill before dinner I will now allow the Minister to conclude the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In order to have an economy that is healthy enough and is expanding at a rate that is rapid enough to absorb all those school leavers, married women and <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who want work, we ought to be able to maintain an expansion of roughly 4 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to a statement by  Dr W.

    <p>For example, the Government is concerned that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to this country should receive assistance in learning English, to help in their adjustment to their new environment, and increased amounts are being provided in this financial year for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was the time to start looking after the true welfare of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> already here - the people who suffer most from unemployment, most from the pressure in the state and parish schools, most from exorbitant land and housing costs, most from the decline of the quality of our cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was the time to stop the loss of 34,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> a year by changing the emphasis from recruiting to retaining <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By contrast the proportion of overseas <span class="highlight">migrants</span> settling in the State over the same period grew from 7.78 per cent in 1965 - that is, roughly proportionate to the existing population - to 12.69 per cent in 1971, which is over 50 per cent above a proportional intake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is no wonder that the workers in those industries, who are in a large proportion <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, revolted causing further problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both  Mr Dunstan,  Premier of South Australia, and  Mr Tonkin,  Premier of Western Australia, have made statements indicating that their State governments would be prepared to receive <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from overseas who might not be able to meet the standards for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> laid down by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that area can be found people who are unemployed, people who are bereaved, people who are injured, and <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, and they are the people who are socially deprived in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It foreshadows the arrival of 140,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who will only add to the employment queues and to the cost to the Australian taxpayer of social services, and who will offer further competition to our already record and increasing level of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>More importantly, it must take a direct interest in the welfare of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have been brought to this country by private project development firms which have nominated <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and made promises which cannot be kept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, we also find that it is in these industries where the greatest number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are employed and when there is unemployment in these industries and a slackening off in employment opportunities, it is the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are the first hit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The third point I make is that inherent in the question of the Leader of the Opposition is his belief that the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> of Austraia have not been able to make the contribution to the development of Australia which we, as a government, claim they have made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts are that there had been such a decline in unemployment among <span class="highlight">migrants</span> between February and May that the Commonwealth Statistician decided that the sample was too small for it to be relied upon as a statistical device. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With regard to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, it is necessary to take into consideration that the total figures for migrant settlers do not represent the number of persons entitled to be enrolled in the Subsidised Health Benefits Plan because, in the case of families, enrolment by the head of the family provides Subsidised Health Benefits entitlements for the whole of the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-39-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>New South Wales can expect a flood of starry eyed British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from the beginning of next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is the concept of New South Wales given by a new Government-sponsored movie designed to seduce British <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the first movie to be used by New South Wales to attract <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Potential <span class="highlight">migrants</span> arc told most families have  a  car, New South Wales abounds in unspoiled natural beauty, there is plenty of housing- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Potential <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are told that there is plenty of housing and that the education system is just fine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be most unfair to those people at present unemployed in Australia if <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were to come here and compete for jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With over 100,000 registered as unemployed, would <span class="highlight">migrants</span> come here to compete with already unemployed Australians for jobs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is strange that the New South Wales Government has taken steps over the past few years to prosecute firms for false advertising: now we have this completely false film advertising New South Wales being shown overseas to attract <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it any wonder that British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are very disturbed when, after being presented with falsehoods, they arrive in Australia only to be disillusioned because they have been conned into coming out here? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To many of the 18,000 Danish <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia, their adopted country is not a happy home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only a few of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> here - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House will well recollect that the inquiry sponsored by the Department of Immigration into the reasons why such a growing higher proportion of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are returning home established the major reason as being that social security and social welfare services - covering the broad conspectus of these things - in Australia are so inferior to what are available overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Adelaide ‘Advertiser’ of 1st lune this year stated, over recent years some 18,000 Danish <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have come to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have our greatest years of prosperity been when Australia received an influx of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the Labor Government of Western Australia, prior to the Brand Administration, refused to take <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and that that State had the greatest incidence of unemployment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the position reversed when the Brand Administration took office and welcomed <span class="highlight">migrants</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seventy-five per cent of the students of Moreland High School are <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Typically it is in the lower income groups, the lower socioeconomic groups, in areas where <span class="highlight">migrants</span> congregate and in areas where both parents have to go to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we look around at the deprived areas in Australia and the deprived schools about which We of the Labor Party talk we see that they are, typically, in the working class area - the areas with larger families, the areas where both parents go to work, the areas where there is a greater concentration of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, areas where there are more families dependent on welfare payments and areas where more children have to leave school at an earlier age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia accepts <span class="highlight">migrants</span> because it is believed that they will make a contribution to our society and our economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be fair to say also that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> come to Australia because of better job opportunities for the adults and better educational and job opportunities for the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally I want to pass a few remarks on the question of the selection of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think on both sides of the House, on the selection of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to go on record as saying that it is my personal belief that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> do not contribute to unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 do not believe we have to look any further for the reason why last year our consumer demand fell than the fact that we reduced our intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> by 45,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Industry was geared to an annual intake of  185,000  <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The records of our immigration intake over the years show that in those years in which we had the greatest number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to Australia we had our lowest level of unemployment and we also enjoyed some of our greatest levels of prosperity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party has said that a Labor government would give preference in selecting <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to the relatives of people already in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Superficially this has a very great humanitarian appeal, but surely it would affect our ability to control the intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> on occupational grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my opinion that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have contributed very greatly to the trades and skills which are in short supply in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is because <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are willing to go anywhere in Australia where employment opportunities are available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">migrants</span> we have brought to this country and the Australian born children of those <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have provided  53  per cent of the increase in population from  8  million in  1950  to  12.7  million in  1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An  examination of the percentage of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> employed in hospitals and education authorities, particularly at the tertiary level, will reveal that they represent a much greater percentage of the population than their percentage of the total population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has reduced per capita social service costs because <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have to be resident in this country for  10  years before they are entitled to receive the age pension, but they have to contribute to social services by way of taxation payments during the whole of their working lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Immigration  (Dr Forbes)  announced earlier this year, quite a number of new measures are proposed both for assessing <span class="highlight">migrants</span> overseas and counselling them prior to their arrival in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope it will not be long before the Government again increases its intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is a nation of immigrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So by rubbishing <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and migration we are rubbishing ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has one of the highest ratios of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to total citizenship anywhere in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The criteria that has applied to chain migration and family reunions in the area I happen to represent have been tougher in practically every respect than the criteria that have been applied to mass recruitment <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seem to recall that the first <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia were most carefully selected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basing our migration programme on chain <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is a sound way to proceed, for this reason: Chain migration has been described as migration without tears. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that if we are to review migration we should review it in the light of the difficulties arising from the non-planning of the settlement of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, the committee which is tackling the recognition of migrant professional and trade qualifications has not had the impact that most <span class="highlight">migrants</span> hoped for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy of the Government this year provides for an intake of 140,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was pleased to hear the honourable member for Scullin mention in his short address this afternoon that we can be selective with our intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, because Australia must surely be a land of great opportunity for anyone who is prepared to apply himself to the task of establishing himself in this great country and taking advantage of the great opportunities that exist for him and his children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must see that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to this country are carefully screened, because there is no doubt that we desire to prevent undesirable types arriving here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that we have not screened and investigated backgrounds of many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> entering Australia over past years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst our check up on health regulations has been first class, I feel that in the screening of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> we have fallen down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course we must attract <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The growth of this country for the past 25 years has been due to our success in attracting <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must continue to bring to Australia <span class="highlight">migrants</span> of a suitable nature to help us to expand and develop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these years <span class="highlight">migrants</span> of a high standard have joined our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our nation has been built by <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and we have not yet ceased to build. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps in the future we will no longer need to build and will no longer need <span class="highlight">migrants</span> but that situation lies in the future and has no practical significance for our time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like more <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to come into our great country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most <span class="highlight">migrants</span> seem to live in the cities and this does not prevent troubles which are often witnessed at sporting fixtures and other community efforts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my electorate are quite a number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the countryside generally there are very few <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in their native countries were city dwellers, or if they were farmers they lived close to a city. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia would benefit if we could obtain more <span class="highlight">migrants</span> suitable to help us to develop our great country towns and country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need a steady flow of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to the points that have been raised tonight on whether <span class="highlight">migrants</span> should be allowed into this country, 1 think to some extent we must realise that some of the opposition to immigration has developed because of the popularisation of what is commonly known as zero population growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has announced that, on the basis of likely needs and the availability of suitable settlers, 140,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will be admitted during the current financial year, 90,000 of these being assisted <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is undeniable that some <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have come into this country over the years have proved to be unsuitable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The essential fact that the Australian people need to realise is that a Labor government would admit <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from anywhere at all without discrimination and, therefore, regardless of their ability to be successfully assimilated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe we must endeavour by every possible means to assist <span class="highlight">migrants</span> after their arrival to become happy and successful settlers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably in no other way than in the treatment of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming into the country could it be more aptly illustrated that his Government has no genuine interest in decentralisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us take, for argument’s sake, the hostels that have been provided for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I call on the Government tonight, at this eleventh hour of its existence, to cast aside the $20 holiday in Australia which has been so openly abused by so many thousands of what I might refer to as illegitimate <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have come to this country, particularly during recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the failure of this Government to provide decent, reasonable social serevice benefits for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>expressed a strong doubt that social services in Australia could be considered as a positive factor in the attraction of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advisory committee that was set up by the Government to inquire into aspects of its current migration policy made that very forthright condemnation of the Government in relation to social service benefits and their influence on the return of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Australia once they reached the stage - to put it quite bluntly - of waking up that they had been hoodwinked into believing that they were coming to a country where a better life was available for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Bowman seems to suggest that we attract <span class="highlight">migrants</span> by giving them handouts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have to clamp down on this desperate desire to bring <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it any wonder that 30 per cent of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> return to their home country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who want to go back but cannot go back suffer in poverty, and the Government knows it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An analysis of settler arrivals for the 5 years ended June 1972 shows that 50 per cent of all the settlers who came to Australia during this time were either Commonwealth or State nominees; a further 12 per cent were unsponsored <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, mainly free flow’ unassisted British settlers; and only 38 per cent of all those who arrived during the 5 years were privately nominated settlers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Restriction of migration to a sponsorship scheme would have meant that almost 79,000 of the 98,847 skilled workers who came as assisted <span class="highlight">migrants</span> during this period would have been lost to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition has stated that under Labor policies: ‘A government would decide the total intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> into Australia but as long as this total were not exceeded, the people who came in would be determined by people already here.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Effective control of immigration requires firstly, that the composition of the migrant intake in terms of sources, skills and integration prospects is suitably balanced, and secondly, that action should be taken by the Government as and when necessary to ensure that the numbers and types of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to Australia are in harmony with our needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason is that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are themselves unsponsored often sponsor relatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For obvious reasons sponsored <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, on arriving in Australia, wish to join their sponsors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the years of our massive immigration programme we were not very selective in terms of quality as long as the immigrants were white. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have made  a  magnificent contribution to Our development, despite the frequent prejudice they suffered as they educated us old Australians to become more tolerant, to become better human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He said a Labor government would not seek <span class="highlight">migrants</span> actively and that it would not stop anyone in Australia, white or colored, vidual citizens to determine - not the Govfrom bringing in relatives as <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At present we are bringing in 140,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> a year, 10,000 of whom are non-European. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So let us continue to encourage and assist as many people to come to Australia as we can absorb, provided we can absorb them as far as is possible into a homogeneous society, a society which is not only in the interests of Australians but also of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many of the schools were built in the 1890s and today we have a massive immigration programme with <span class="highlight">migrants</span> nocking into these schools which have no proper facilities to cope with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If one takes the population into account - as I believe one should under the Constitution and as the Supreme Court of the United States insists must be done under the American Constitution, from which we have borrowed the same words - the disparity would be still greater because the numbers of electors do not include <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are unnaturalised and citizens who are still under 21 years of age and Aborigines who have not chosen to enrol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the responsible Minister to look at the probability of giving full recognition to these people who are Australian citizens, who have retained their citizenship right through and who have served the British Commonwealth and the British Commonwealth only.I can understand some reluctance, to extend this benefit to people who are European <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-56-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, almost 1 per cent of our population increase has been as a result of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to this country; another 1 per cent comes from national increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instead of there being planning to decentralise industry, as was done by the Department of Postwar Reconstruction, so that these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and industries would go to the country areas, they went into the cities and have aggravated the growth problems of the cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because they are <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who arrived in this country with little or nothing they are heavily in debt through purchasing furnishings and paying for accommodation and transport and who can ill-afford the luxury of the trip to the employment office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has he any information which shows that the overwhelming majority of Australians do not want to see any Ugandan Asians brought to Australia and also that they feel strongly that the intake of 10,000 coloured and semi-coloured <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, other than Chinese, should be reduced to no more than SOO annually. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-53-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This concept takes into account various factors which are not covered by a simple measure of departures, including those who return to Australia as second time <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and those who enter as visitors and obtain a change of status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I fully support these remarks and emphasise that only when we have fully accepted all <span class="highlight">migrants</span> into the Australian family, as citizens with equal ranking in all respects, will this desirable goal be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the extent that the departure rate can be reduced by improved selection procedures and through greater attention to the settlement problems of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, no effort will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major reasons for the departure of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Australia which have emerged from this report are, as I interpret the interim comments of the Committee, similar to many of those reported by the Committee in 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem of settler loss has to be seen against the contemporary background of world wide high mobility of labour and the steady improvement in economic conditions and social services in a number of countries from which the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report points out that there are many factors influencing departure, some of which relate to the general economic and social structure of the country as a whole, and others which are of a personal nature and relate to the particular needs of individual <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report clearly advocates that remedial action concerning the factors which influence the departure of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> should take into account the relative importance of these factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would ask the Minister to consider making a ministerial statement which would set out the full details of the new Government’s approach to immigration, the basic principles which it is following, the determining factors which influence the total number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> which the Government intends to seek to bring to Australia this year and their impact upon the whole migrant program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Immigration, I stated that <span class="highlight">migrants</span>’ contributions to Australia’s economic growth are important by any standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are not just economic units in a program of massive development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistent with this philosophy, the previous Government extended and intensified - on a continuing basis - the training of migration officers to better equip them to counsel and advise prospective <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We employed specialist officers to develop progressively counselling facilities such as those for wives and single female <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We worked towards a fuller recognition of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>’ professional, technical and trade qualifications by establishing such organisations as the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Opposition parties will be submitting positive and constructive proposals and we hope that those initiatives when put to the House will be seriously examined by the Minister in no sense on party political comment but in the context of what can best be done in this country for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and the extension of migrant welfare services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s commendable desire to stem the departure rate of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is presumably based on the belief that Australia remains reliant upon a continuing level of migration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the migrant program is now to be based upon the sponsorship by <span class="highlight">migrants</span> already living in Australia is in our judgment a retrograde decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s policy apparently assumes that the sum total of the individual wishes of relatives of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will always equal the sum total of Australia’s migration needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former Government combined 2 processes in its immigration program - sponsorship programs designed to encourage family reunion and actively seeking <span class="highlight">migrants</span> under government sponsorsip to fulfil those needs not met by family sponsorship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s policy is also a disincentive to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from North America, northern Europe and the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important, in the context of the findings of the report tabled by the Minister, that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from these countries should not be confronted by a number of governmentcreated problems clearly associated with the trend in departure rates of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of some concern to honourable gentlemen on this side of the House to learn from recent Press reports of the major increase in the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> returning home since the election of a Federal Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt the concern about inflation which the Government is generating in this country is not just a concern experienced by those <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have sought to return home in greater numbers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s proposal to require all future British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to renounce their British citizenship if they wish- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had difficulty in recent years - I say ‘we’ as a nation - in recruiting the number of British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> that we have required for our purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the honourable gentleman does not really care about the welfare of British <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Perhaps he is unconcerned that they happen to be the largest community of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There seems also to be implied in the concept of zero population growth the argument that if we have problems with urban areas in some way those problems have been created by <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite seem to blame <span class="highlight">migrants</span> for urbanising Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to understand that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have contributed a capacity for us to handle the problems which have been created in the past by urbanisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition criticised also an attitude which he believes the Government has to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We on this side of the House welcome <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Successive Liberal-Country Party governments in previous years have a lot to answer for because of the way in which they treated <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Far too many children of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were given their schooling in areas where facilities and accommodation were inadequate and, in some cases, deplorable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I give the assurance to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition and to the House generally that this Government will take action to see to it that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who come before our courts, are convicted and have records that put them within the provisions of deportation will not remain in our midst. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has raised the question of the status of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in our community, I place on record in this House that since World War II more than 3 million people have come to this country and the overwhelming majority of them have been great citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister able to reconcile these instructions with claims by the Victorian Minister for Education that he realises English teaching to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is of great importance to certain schools, particularly those in inner suburbs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is understandable that some Yugoslav <span class="highlight">migrants</span> of Croatian origin should continue to hope for the establishment of an independent Croatia and within a democracy like Australia they have a right to advocate their views so long as they do so by legitimate means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have reason to believe that the terrorists are endeavouring to create the impression amongst Yugoslav <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia that the Croatian extremists have the support of significant sections of Australian society and even the government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not abandon our democratic principles of free speech, belief and association but I would hope that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are left with no misunderstanding of the disfavour with which the Government would view  any activities which might reasonably give rise to objections by the present governments of their countries of origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the timely action taken by the Minister for Immigration a service is now rendered to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are experiencing difficulties of communication in matters of urgency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The arrangements made involve a 24-hour telephone service and I am informed that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> generally are delighted with this facility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that it would be more advantageous if this facility were brought to the notice of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> by having it inserted in an appropriate place in the directory and I undertake to see that this is done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that a considerable number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> believe that a slur has been cast on the migrant community in general by the statement made on Tuesday by  Senator Murphy  and that many of them who are not yet naturalised are fearful for their safety? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position is that the greatest slur that has been cast on the migrant community in Australia has been cast upon it by the handful of people who have brought discredit on all of the community by their acts of violence and by their law breaking, and this is resented by the vast majority of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who resent being associated with people who are criminals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I had not only authorised, but directed, the Attorney-General from his first week in office to do what his predecessors conspicuously failed to do - to follow up departmental and ministerial reports on the growth of terrorist activities in Australia and the threat that they represented not only to all Australians but to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in particular and to our relations with a country with which we have had unbroken relations since 1918 and of which we have been an ally in 2 wars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister for Labour noticed a statement by the head of his Department,  Mr Sharpe,  implying a clear criticism of the South Australian Government and South Australian Housing Trust for apparently making available homes to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Whyalla 10 days after their arrival, in comparison with a 12 to 16-week waiting time for unemployed South Australians from, say, Adelaide? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Prime Minister the following question: In view of the McCarthy-like allegations made by him in  this place and by the Attorney-General in another place firstly against <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia and now against individual public servants and his instigation of inquiries into, to use his words the ‘possible malevolence and incompetence’ of the latter, will the Prime Minister, if he cannot now open the inquiry to public scrutiny, undertake to table in this House the full result of his inquiry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Members of this House do not represent only those electors who voted for them or even just the electors; they also represent those who do not have the vote those <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have elected not to take out Australian citizenship and the thousands of children too young to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not in the country but in the city and rural-urban electorates - in places like Mount Druitt, in the electorate of Chifley, where 70 per cent are under 14 years and in my own electorate of La Trobe, which covers more than 1,000 square miles, with the second largest voting population in Victoria and with a fair percentage of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and an above average population of pensioners and one-parent families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Under these procedures, one of the five basic requirements to be met by <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is that they should have a sincere intention of making a permanent home in Australia, and joining the Australian family through citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we already know that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> contribute proportionately more to the workforce than they do to the population supported by that workforce, that they include a substantial proportion of skilled and other key workers, that the great majority receive all their educational and vocational training prior to coming here and, therefore, at no cost to Australia and that they contribute particularly to the maintenance and development of key industries and services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-36-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But for equally long too little has been contributed by those governments towards the special needs of so many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> especially during their difficult period of adjusting to a new, alien and not always hospitable society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The presence of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this country has been valuable to this nation and has given it and its people a far better future than would have been achieved otherwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is much that should have been done to assist many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and we intend remedying this neglect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While it will benefit mainly aged, invalid and widowed <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who wish to return to their former homelands, cither permanently or temporarily, it will apply equally to all pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have never supported the proposition that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are in some way obliged to forget the affairs of their homelands - their ancestral homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I fully recognise and endorse the right of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia to maintain their links with, and their interest in, the affairs of their former countries, I have to insist that such interest cannot be exercised in such a way as to distress other Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, I wish to remove any grounds for discrimination in matters of citizenship and employment against <span class="highlight">migrants</span> or any section of any migrant community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We highly value the contribution made to Australia by most Croatian <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> remembered the 1930s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have reason to believe that the terrorists are endeavouring to create the impression among Yugoslav <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia that the Croatian extremists have the support of significant sections of Australian society and even the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Migration Act, I have the authority, as Minister, to order the deportation of aliens and immigrants in certain defined circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The special reports branch is not concerned only with offences by <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is equally concerned with offences which affect the interests of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is today a genuine fear among those members of the Australian community who are <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to this country, particularly those who came from Eastern European countries, that those midnight and pre-dawn knocks on the door, which are reminiscent of the very reason for their leaving their own countries, are likely to be repeated in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After this period in Australia substantial numbers of fine <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have come to know Australia, feel settled here, want to identify themselves as members of our community and are in fact living as such without friction or problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from all the 31 Commonwealth countries will now have the same opportunity as other <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to take part in citizenship ceremonies suitably marking the important occasion of their becoming citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By these means, and by all other possible means, it is the Government’s wish to ensure that our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Commonwealth countries are no longer ignored or left in the mistaken belief that they acquire our citizenship automatically and that the rest of the Australian community attaches no importance to their becoming citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We intend to demonstrate that beyond any shadow of doubt, and warmly welcome all <span class="highlight">migrants</span> without distinction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again this seeks to remove a condition of granting citizenship that burdened some of our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> more than others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in fact, of course, the legislation covers a large number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Between them those countries account for a large number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time the Opposition wishes to protect the interests of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and indeed all Australians in achieving true portability of pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People are concerned about the doubtful position which British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> occupy at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, most <span class="highlight">migrants</span> - not all, but most - were covered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Italy, Malta, Greece and Turkey we were covered by agreements negotiated under the new legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all want a fair thing to be done to the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> that come to Australia, whether they come from the United Kingdom or from Europe or wherever it may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The migrant community should be treated fairly, but if <span class="highlight">migrants</span> require over-generous treatment, in the short term they may get advantage and the Australian Labor Party may get votes, but over the long term that is not to the advantage of the groups in the migrant community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether honourable members - 1 am speaking now not of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> but of Aborigines - saw recently on television a backlash from towns in the Northern Territory about what was being done for our Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> also I say this: A fair go is what they are entitled to and what we should give them, but we should be very careful that we are not opening the Australian Treasury to plunder - not by the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are here; they are not the people I am talking about at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This we do not want, and if these carpet baggers come from overseas to Australia for this purpose they will be doing things which are to the disadvantage of those good <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are now in Australia, whom we want to help and who are entitled to fair deals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it is a further development in our review of the migration system and of the official attitude to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the reciprocal arrangements made with the 4 countries I have mentioned, a considerable number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are already covered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice from the most recent consolidated statistics of the Department of Immigration that for the period 1945 to 1972 inclusive the numbers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> regarded as permanent  and long term arrivals, by country of last residence, are as follows: Greece  210,000,  Italy  404,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As will be seen, the reciprocal arrangements cover in general terms - I know that this is not a strictly accurate representation of the cover available -  703,000  <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this leaves an enormous number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> uncovered in the event that they wish to return to their original countries of residence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same table in the Department’s consolidated statistics covering the same period, that is  1945  to  1972  inclusive, we find the following numbers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> regarded as permanent and long term arrivals, by country of last residence: The United Arab Republic  32,000,  South Africa  24,000,  Canada  53,000,  United States of America  124,000,  Ceylon  12,000,  Cyprus  17,000,  Hong Kong  26,000,  India,  37.000,  Malaysia  54,000,  Singapore  24,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the House that I am comparing them with the number of  703,000  <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who would be covered under existing reciprocal arrangements if they returned to their countries of origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1  do not want to delay the House, but I think that for the sake of completeness it would be worthwhile to put into the record a list of the numbers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from some other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have omitted those countries with fewer than  10,000  <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the period I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>but they come to well over one million <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming from countries with which we have no reciprocal agreement and in respect of which the possibility of reaching a reciprocal agreement in some cases is nebulous and in other cases non-existent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> wished to return to their countries of origin or indeed to any other country other than the  4  with which we already have agreements, they would be left out in the cold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I represent an area which has numerous <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This sort of situation occurs particularly in mining communities which have a great number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and this provision of the Bill will be particularly appreciated by them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a debate which concerns the transferability of pensions to other countries we might refer perhaps to some of the unique and special difficulties of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who live in unusual places, such as the numerous <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who live in the city of Mt Isa which is my headquarters in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People often ask: Why the blazes do <span class="highlight">migrants</span> not get away from the major cities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people should look beyond the horizons of the metropolitan areas and they will find that great numbers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> - thousands of them - live in places far from the major cities and, more particularly, in mining centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Social Security to give heed to my suggestion - and to pass it on to his colleague, the Minister for Immigration - that special facilities should be created in these areas to inform the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> about such matters as portability of pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  mentioned that elderly <span class="highlight">migrants</span> always have a yen to return to their particular fatherlands to die, but I do not think many of them do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Bill is passed - I am quite sure it will be, with the amendment, I hope - the next step will be to convey the information regarding the new provisions to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> throughout the length and breadth of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My interest in the Bill probably stems from the fact that there is a large percentage of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in my own electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My particular interest in the electorate stems from discussions with Italian, German and Dutch, but particularly British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in my electorate who have informed me that they are reluctant to take out Australian citizenship because they feel that they are not getting a fair deal if they do not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But before we discuss the qualification and the reasons for shortening the qualification period for portability we should know something about those people who leave this country in their retiring years and particularly those <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have returned to their former countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Examination of this shows that it reflects the lower proportion of refugees in current immigration - that is, refugees tend to stay more than other <span class="highlight">migrants</span> - the greater ease of travel in recent years, the strong economic attraction of western Europe, and the growing number of skilled and highly qualified persons who, as part of an increasingly mobile international community, often move from Australia after a few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During citizenship ceremonies I am reminded that the reluctance of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to take out Australian citizenship stems from the fact that they do not feel justly rewarded for the contributions they have made in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one reason for their departure and points to the desirability of recognising the contributions that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> make in this country in 10 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does underscore one of the basic reasons why people return to their mother country and reminds the House that one of the reasons for bringing in this social security Bill is a recognition that we must update and improve our social security and provide better value for each dollar spent on it so that it can stand comparison with the social security systems in the countries from which most of our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee concludes that, while there is an increasing tendency for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to leave Australia, this is in keeping with patterns of movement which were already in evidence during the previous inquiry and which conform with those being experienced currently by other migrant receiving countries throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if this Bill were not designed to stem the departure flow of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> it does recognise the increase in mobility that has taken place throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must also be seen that Australia’s ability to retain its <span class="highlight">migrants</span> depends to a large extent on the opportunities available here and elsewhere and the acceptance of settlers by the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be remembered that even if <span class="highlight">migrants</span> spend only a few years in Australia they contribute to our national development while still more is contributed by those whose departure from Australia does not take place until they reach retiring age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This concerns principally the aged, invalid or widowed <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who choose to return home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many of our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> this is an urgent matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that Bill had become law, more than 300,000 unnaturalised <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who perhaps wished to return to their homelands would have been denied pension justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from the numerous other countries completely missed out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, because naturally I am concerned about any reduction in services to newly arrived <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, I have asked the Commonwealth Immigration Publicity Council to look at the whole question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I told the Prime Minister that we would welcome Mauritian representation in Australia and, apart from our need for area consultation, the opportunity that this might provide to tell Australians of the great pleasure they could derive from visiting the star and key of the Indian Ocean, that we were happy with the way in which the 26,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Mauritius have settled without difficulties in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:  (1), (2) and (3) Requests for financial assistance which my Department receives from organisations or persons acting on behalf of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> fall generally in 2 areas - those which relate to assistance in acquiring land or premises for the establishment of ethnic clubs and those which relate to funds to support the employment of persons engaged in welfare work in the migrant community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Community agencies engaged in direct welfare service to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> may apply for a grant to meet the salary costs of a social worker to further expand such work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The attendance of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> at English classes, however, should not be made a condition for the grant of unemployment benefit and the mere fact that a migrant may not attend is not of itself sufficient reason for refusing benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps, however, I have to make it clear once again that the question of dual nationality has been about for very many years between Australia and many other countries from which Australia has drawn <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are not significant numbers of American settlers in this country in receipt of the type of fixed or occasionally variable income of the type to which I have referred, but there are large numbers of United Kingdom <span class="highlight">migrants</span> living in Australia who are in receipt of pensions, government or employer-base, who have been adversely affected in terms of their real Australian income as a result of the revaluation of the Australian dollar on the 2 occasions on which the effect of international currency movements has been to revalue the Australian dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have drawn the attention of the Sydney task force to this specific case for investigation and for examination of the whole problem of predators who undoubtedly take advantage of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>’ lack of knowledge of our language and lack of knowledge of Australia to take their illegal or improper exactions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has he had any discussion with the Minister about amending the way in which <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are selected to come to Australia, that is, has he discussed whether the Government will recommence recruiting <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia according to their skills for work in the work force and not rely solely upon family reunions to answer the need of Australia’s development and the shortage of workers in, for instance, the important building industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary, the main points of the Bill are as follows: Firstly, it establishes a uniform qualifying period for citizenship which will apply to all <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation seeks to remove the position of preferment which British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have enjoyed since the inception of Australia’s immigration program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the years since, even as the base of our immigration program has broadened as never before, British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have continued to be the cornerstone, the very real base, of immigration to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 5-year period between 1967-68 and 1971-72, for example, there were 332,987 British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the total of 801,011 people who came to make their homes in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know of your close understanding of questions affecting all <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already indicated that the Opposition is opposed to the proposal to delete all references to the Queen from the oat-h of allegiance taken by <span class="highlight">migrants</span> at citizenship ceremonies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition supports the change of name for the function at which <span class="highlight">migrants</span> become Australians from ‘naturalisation ceremony’ to ‘cit izenship ceremony’, lt supports also the move to lower the age at which a person becomes eligible to citizenship, from 21 to 18 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> are worried and concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opposition members have spoken to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have that apprehension and on behalf of the migrant community we call upon the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It becomes apparent as one shares with <span class="highlight">migrants</span> their hopes and their aspirations that all but a tiny minority - I submit that such a minority can be found among the old as well as the new citizens - contribute energetically and effectively to the nation’s work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the amendment could not and does not desire to change that requirement, it does remove an embarrassing and sometimes burdening condition which affects some <span class="highlight">migrants</span> more than others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> from the 31 countries listed in clause 5 have, up to the present, enjoyed privileges and opportunities not available to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government feels that this is particularly necessary, for many British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are under the mistaken impression that their United Kingdom background and their long residence in Australia automatically confers Australian citizenship upon them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If comparatively few British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have in the past sought Australian citizenship either by notification or registration, we as Australians have only ourselves to blame. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst we have, accorded non-British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> citizenship under the official Commonwealth orders and ceremonies, we have left the British migrant to be welcomed by Good Neighbour Councils and other non-governmental bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can we wonder that some British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have looked a little wistfully at our citizenship ceremonies and have wondered why they were not encouraged to participate in an oath or affirmation of allegiance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill, which will amend the Citizenship Act, demonstrates how seriously we regard our citizenship and how warmly we welcome <span class="highlight">migrants</span> free from the indignities of special inducements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Australia welcomes all <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as candidates for citizenship under common and uniform conditions for all countries will, I know, appeal to an inbuilt British sense of justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from all the 31 Commonwealth countries will now have the same opportunity as other <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to take part in citizenship ceremonies suitably marking the important occasion of their becoming citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This conjures up a picture of tens of thousands of British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> seriously disaffected because they do not have the privilege of being naturalised at a naturalisation ceremony and, instead, are seriously discriminated against by being able to acquire citizenship by registration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It conjures up a picture of thousands of would-be British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> deterred from coming to Australia because they will face this fearful discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mesmerised by the Minister’s words, people are not aware that his actions have seriously reduced the supply of good quality British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> of European origin, that the composition of our immigration program has changed rapidly so that there no longer is a predominance of people from western Europe, Britain and North America of European descent arriving in Australia under the program; that the proportion of people with skills and professional qualifications has fallen and given way to people who have no other qualification than a relative in Australia who is prepared to sponsor them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what he has lost sight of is that only a small proportion of this integration effort is required for British <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the fact that we have been able, largely successfully, to digest a migrant intake in the post-war years that is proportionately greater than that of any other country in history, or modern history anyway, is due to one cardinal feature of every migration program in every year since 1945, that is, that the proportion of British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> has never fallen below 50 per cent of the total and in many years has been considerably above it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has done a pretty good job already in making sure that British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will be a smaller proportion of future programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said something about the proposals in the Bill to make it more difficult for people from Britain to become citizens of Australia let me say something about the provisions designed to make it easier for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from every country other than Britain to become Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They include inequalities between pre-school children, depending upon whether they live in the Australian Capital Territory or in the various States; inequalities between our children, depending upon which school they attend; inequalities between men and women; inequalities between the wage earner and the prices setter, inequalities between the electors in the State electorates and particularly in Commonwealth electorates, depending upon the electorate in which they leave; inequalities between <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, depending upon the country of their origin; inequalities between overseas visitors and more particularly between <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, depending upon the country of origin; and, of course, inequalities between applicants who seek eligibility for citizenship under the terms of the Act enforced by the previous Government - the Act which this Bill seeks to amend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The existence of these inequalities has in the past often deterred <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from even seeking naturalisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition referred this evening to the adverse effects that the proposals contained in this Bill have already had and will continue to have on the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to Australia from the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am reminded of the fact that during the time the Government of which he was a member sought to attract <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Great Britain it never at any time achieved any more than a 50 per cent migrant intake in one year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did not make any pretence that it was interested in receiving <span class="highlight">migrants</span> except from certain selected countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we discard prejudices, so will we improve our capacity to assimilate <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from all countries of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the postwar immigration scheme started nearly 4 million <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have come to live in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have asked me: ‘What does naturalisation mean? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we are losing or weakening another link with Britain by taking away the preference’ which British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> presently enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I believe that we would make the position of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from those countries a bit stronger by including in the oath or affirmation of allegiance the act of renunciation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we ought to be encouraging <span class="highlight">migrants</span> if we want them to become Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the best way for us to encourage <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to take out Australian citizenship is to point out to them the advantages of becoming Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> cannot really become part of a community unless they participate on a level with their fellow Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that most <span class="highlight">migrants</span> would want to be at one with their children, and their children, whether the parents like it or not, surely will grow up as Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When <span class="highlight">migrants</span> become Australian citizens they have the advantage of being able to choose the Government of the country in which they live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In becoming Australian citizens, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have just as much say in choosing the government as anyone else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> have changed Australia’s eating habits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not one who believes, as do some of the critics of our migration program, that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> contribute to unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact that at the time when Australia was taking its greatest number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> we had the lowest percentage of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sorry that the present Government has seen fit to cut the intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said the same thing to the previous Government when it reduced the intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Government has announced that its main criterion in selecting <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will be the unification of families, and that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> should be nominated by families already in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I believe that if that becomes the main criterion and we discard our selectivity on the basis of employment, skills, and if qualifications are not essential, it is possible that many of our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> could add to the pool of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In saying that, 1 want to point out that I do not believe that we ought to worry too much about <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who return to their homelands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the countries of Europe from which <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have come are experiencing very much greater prosperity than before, and there are always people who are not prepared to settle in another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> want to retain their right to move around. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want to retain the largest possible number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who come to Australia we ought to be encouraging them to seek naturalisation and to want to belong to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, there was a policy statement on the selection of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> which the Minister made on 31st January 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new Government has introduced certain changes which are to the disadvantage of our traditional <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, that is, the British. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we look back on recent years, we see that between 1967 and 1968 more than 46 per cent of the 137,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who came to Australia were from the United Kingdom, in 1968-69 the figure was 44 per cent, in 1969-70 it was 39 per cent, in 1970-71 the figure was 36 per cent and in 1971-72 more than 40 per cent of Australia’s <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were from the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is - the Minister has lost sight of this - that the previous Government was not practising discrimination against nonUnited Kingdom <span class="highlight">migrants</span> because it applied a different time factor for qualifying for naturalisation to the non-British migrant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The previous Government was recognising that the United Kingdom migrant, who had come from a country with a Westminster system of Parliament and practices a way of life this country has followed, was more easily able to assimilate to the Australian way of fife than were many non-British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who, after 3 years in this country, perhaps could not even speak the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will make the oath of allegiance more practical and simpler and will bring uniformity to the processes through which <span class="highlight">migrants</span> must go to become Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a great pity that in the operation of this policy the present Minister for Immigration has maintained a continued restraint on the level of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am opposed to the changes which he is introducing in the origins of those <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adding the words ‘of Australia’ provides a form which all <span class="highlight">migrants</span> should be able to accept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has talked more about British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> than any other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet during its long term of office it left many British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> completely in the dark about their citizenship status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill simply proposes that all discrimination be eliminated from the requirements for the grant of Australian citizenship to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that the requirement has done is cause a great many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to refrain from applying for citizenship because they find it a severe emotional obstacle to appear to renounce culture, background and home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am concerned that in terms of the renunciation individual <span class="highlight">migrants</span> recognise that they are not required to renounce their country of origin; they are required only to renounce their allegiance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can well understand individual <span class="highlight">migrants</span> believing that the Queen is the Queen of the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have spoken towards the change of relativity in the position of British <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He referred to his concern for British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> so I thought I would quote a letter from the  President  of the British Sub-branch of the Victorian Returned Services League. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have received several telephone calls from my Sub-branch members drawing my attention to the report All the callers were most enthusiastic over your comments and your outlook towards <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, in particular those who came from the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the voice of the British <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, not the members of the Opposition and I am grateful for it because that is my dedication. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a very high proportion of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in my area - about 35 per cent of the population was born overseas - and also a high proportion of elderly people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">migrants</span> tend mainly to be unskilled or semi-skilled people and, of course, the elderly people are mainly pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact Qantas has carried 83 per cent of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> under arrangements and programs that have been carried out directly by the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will certainly ask my Department to explore whether we could have a collection and perhaps the basis of a monument to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the national capital which would bring together all this historic data. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provisions of the Migration Act relating to the deportation of aliens and persons who are in law regarded as <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will continue to apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole migrant community in Australia was placed in a position where fears were created amongst <span class="highlight">migrants</span> that they might be deported, and might be deported to a country which perhaps did not have the protection of citizens, particularly in the case of political offences, which would be applicable here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to ask the Government to try to publicise in the migrant community the effect of this Bill so that the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> - certainly naturalised <span class="highlight">migrants</span> - can be quite sure that they will not be deported from Australia and that they will not be sent back to any country which they fear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the reference to a European language was obviously intended to attract <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to the scheme and it achieved its purpose because, as well as my own constituents, two other foreign language speaking migrant couples were present at the meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all the worse when directed against <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who may not be so proficient in English as to understand the implications of the scheme they are being invited to join or who may not be as aware as the population generally of the previous warnings which have been given against this form of selling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would mean little difficulty except that certain local government areas may face special difficulties as a result of an influx of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> or young families who place greater demands on community services than do older people because the extra people outnumber the extra ratepayers in any such increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee’s task involved examination of procedures for application by <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as well as their selection and counselling, and it first considered these latter aspects in depth at a meeting on 27 January 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-40-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>More recently, at my instigation, special emphasis has been placed on the need for all <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to have the sincere intention of settling permanently in Australia and joining the Australian family through citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-40-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that because many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have like interests in Europe they represent a high proportion of such labour? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does his reported change of policy allow for a greater number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from the areas I have mentioned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The influx of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to our nation and the granting of full franchise to our Aboriginal people mean that the demands upon the officers and their staff to disperse this knowledge has increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He capped this 11-line reference to immigration with a sad attempt to create further divisions in our society by talking about people disliking <span class="highlight">migrants</span> - surely a strange phrase in a nation of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its members were trying to do this very sincerely and well but I discovered that their greatest single obstacle was not in trying to relate what was happening to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to Australia but in trying to work out what happened between so-called Australians - between the Victorians and the New South Welshmen, between the New South Welshmen and the Queenslanders and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I commend the Committee warmly for its work because in the process of trying to give a new deal to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> it has also set out of course to bring some unity in the professional sphere to Australians generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I was interrupted by the right honourable member for Lowe I was about to say that the article in the ‘Financial Review’ to which my attention has been drawn and which has been referred to by the honourable member for Bowman does pose a series of serious criticisms about the teaching of English to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> over the last quarter of a century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recognising this, to save Australia from further embarrassment as a nation which has discriminatory citizenship, and to bring some justice to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, to rescue the Bill from a Senate pigeon-hole - now a deep well for all sorts of things which have been irresponsibly rejected - this Government reluctantly accepts the Senate amendment and  1  commend the motion that I have moved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government considered that with the changing pattern of immigration into Australia and the Government’s own initiatives in immigration policy giving priority to family reunion and sponsored’ migration it should attain self-sufficiency in respect of movement of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and that it was no longer appropriate for Australia to remain a member of ICEM. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those member governments from whose countries <span class="highlight">migrants</span> chiefly came were informed of the decision coincidentally with notification to the Director of ICEM. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have already had some discussions through the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council with  Mr L.  J. Mooney who is the  President  of the Australian Council of Local Government Association and through him and with his co-operation the Association is at the present time carrying out a survey of all local government bodies with a view to ascertaining what their needs are, what their desires are and how we can help in the supply of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> or, if you like, the diversion of settlers from these inner city areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> are not available to be ordered around like shock troops to man the front lines of industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those who suffer under the unemployment pool concept are the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and the low income earners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition closed his eyes to breach after breach and of course this meant that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who could not speak English and did not understand their rights were being exploited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight he has made statements about other governments being concerned about the movement of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then he writes to me and says that if we do this people will think we are actually recruiting <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I saw one particular headline in a journal in Victoria which said: ‘<span class="highlight">Migrants</span> wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister for Immigration inform the House what measures are being taken by the Government to overcome the drastic shortage of interpreters to assist <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with little or no English in such matters as contracts, court cases and government welfare services? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I emphasise the task should not be left to them or to governments alone, but is a responsibility that should be accepted and shared by all sectors of the community whose economic progress and personal lives have been enriched by the contribution <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It arose out of the then Government’s concern that both adult and child <span class="highlight">migrants</span> should have every assistance and every opportunity and in fact should get specialised assistance to acquire facility in the English language rapidly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only a small percentage will be spent on the education of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, yet this is generally accepted as the most important factor in their assimilation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another problem found by the Migrant Task Force was that there is a general lack of knowledge amongst the normal teaching staff at schools of cultural backgrounds of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, their customs and attitudes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problems of assimilating <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from many countries throughout the world are too obvious to be detailed in the House at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have come here in substantial numbers since the end of the Second World War. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any of us who have had much to do with assisting <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in regard to the problems of settling in and making their way in Australia and coping with the myriad problems which beset any persons when they come to a new country would support, I am sure, any move by this Government or any other government to make this assimilation easier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other aspect concerns female <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe there are many female <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in every major city in Australia, particularly wives of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who may be in the older age bracket, who have a great deal of difficulty, and it appears not a great deal of incentive, in learning English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the program should be continually assessed in relation to the education of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the English language before and after they arrive in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we could avoid many of the problems which face <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to this country, particularly those who lack fluency in the English language if before they arrived in this country they had more adequate English language education courses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In supporting it I personally hope that a continuing review is maintained so that the scheme can be further improved with the objective of assisting not only the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia in a personal sense but also improving the whole welfare of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">migrants</span> to communicate with other members of the community is fundamental- to their successful integration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second assumption is that if the community encourages -<span class="highlight">migrants</span> to learn English, the community and <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will be the richer in both social and . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Effectively only 20 per .cent of the children in the schools surveyed who need English tuition are receiving enough of it, and the largest single concentration of disadvantaged schools is located in and about Melbourne, where there are very high proportions of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from non-English speaking countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a time when the problems of educational deprivation among <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, and for that matter among fifth generation Australians, was susceptible of relatively easy solution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The expectations of the various elements of society influence the performance not only of Australians but also of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Community attitudes towards <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have been characterised by false beliefs of wide currency that no government action has been taken to dispel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1971 in this House I was aware of this problem, and in reference to adult and adolescent <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who were arriving in thiscountry to go straight into factories, I said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But despite this, the Department is insisting that instruction not only for adolescent and older <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, including those who will hardly be involved in the wider spheres of community life because they are confined to the home, but also for children, should be by the situation method as though the study of language or the proper use of words can be divorced from the study of the history and literature that produced those words. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But more importantly we must make the schools for adult and adolescent <span class="highlight">migrants</span> more popular, and in this regard I must confess to disappointment that the trade unions have so far made no approach to the Victorian Migrant Task Force Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of us who view education from the outside, neither as teachers, nor as pupils, nor as employers, cannot escape the conclusion that no matter how much money we pour into schools they are not going to succeed in developing or freeing the potential of our children or of our adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do hope that the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Grassby),  who is now at the table and who represents a rural electorate with a large percentage of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> enrolled at the schools in that area, will ensure that some of these classrooms will also be provided in rural areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> have come to Australia from many different countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally speaking, once <span class="highlight">migrants</span> passed through the gates of the migrant hostel and were finally thrown into the community, the Government forgot about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, it was only in recent years that the previous Government showed any signs of coming to grips with its responsibility for a continuing interest in the lives of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, for almost 20 years the Liberals stuck to this balance, ignoring the fact that gradually over the years the circumstances that originally warranted a target of one per cent had changed drastically and, consequently, in the minds of many economists and others actively concerned with the welfare of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and their assimilation into the Australian way of life, the target became economically unjustifiable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But for many years the responsibility for financing education and providing the resources for the provision of education of a general nature or of a particular nature, such as was required by the non-English speaking <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, was that of the States and of course, this is where the scheme of things broke down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was revealed to a large extent by the survey conducted into the needs of child <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the schools in the high density migrant areas of Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was disclosed to the House recently in reply to a question that I asked him in regard to the rigid system and methodology, of teaching that had been used for English language training for migrant children and for adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span> over a long period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He indicated to me in answer to my question that he is investigating and giving consideration to bringing people to Australia and awarding fellowships to teachers who speak English who would come here from some of the major countries from which we draw our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and that these people would be fitted into the Australian schools system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is common knowledge and accepted by most people that Australia has been one of the most successful countries in integrating large numbers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> into its community, preserving that which has been good in the cultures and backgrounds of the people who have come here, whilst at the same time integrating them with the peoples already established here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe - and history will bear me out - ‘that 2 December was a watershed in the question of attitudes to integration of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> into the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> themselves are illiterate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means, of course, <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, perhaps in a special category, but there are other special categories too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Minister might consider the success of ‘good neighbour councils’ in assisting, on a local basis, the problems faced by <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a former Minister for Immigration, I am aware of the success which these councils have had in facilitating the integration of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I represent a great industrial area where huge numbers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have come to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has the administrative control of the Government’s education projects in relation to adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The projects are in line with the Government’s policy as far as adults are concerned to encourage community involvement in education, in this case the adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member will be aware that as far as child <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are concerned we are worried about the fact that the States have no classrooms for the children to be taken to and given special lessons in English, retiring from the normal classrooms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The areas involved are low income earning families, people receiving unemployment, sickness and special benefits and <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister taken any action on the recommendation of the Victorian Migrant Task Force that steps should be taken to warn newly arrived <span class="highlight">migrants</span> of dangers associated with the use and abuse of hire purchase? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concern was expressed in the reports of the Task Forces about <span class="highlight">migrants</span> being exploited because they are not totally aware of how best to use hire purchase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because I see migrant education as one of the most vital matters affecting <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, I asked that this area should be given first priority by the Migrant Task Forces Committees which I set up earlier in the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of those Palestinian Arabs who claimed that their ancestors had lived in Palestine for hundreds of years were in fact <span class="highlight">migrants</span> themselves from other parts of the Middle East, attracted to Tel Aviv and Haifa and to the communal farms because of the opportunities to gain employment and to trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bearing in mind employment at that time, it seemed that a lower intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> for the forthcoming year would be appropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the New South Wales migrant task force recommendation for the creation of special orientation courses for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to be implemented? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think also there was a suggestion that a survey should be made of the problems of single <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should say that we could incorporate some of the suggestions concerning a survey of single <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in some of the survey work which is now proceeding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> need not apply for assistance but are eligible for medical and hospital benefits during their first two months in Australia by enrolling in a registered health insurance organization and producing evidence of their date of first entry into the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For example, Aborigines, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and electors with young children are not uniformly dispersed throughout the various regions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Certainly the practice of describing people as <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, newcomers or new Australians after 20 years or 27 years of being a citizen is one to be deprecated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent years, because of the rundown in the migrant intake and the age of many migrant hostels, the problem of transition accommodation for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> has become acute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some areas, mainly in the capital cities, new flat-type accommodation has been provided on a transitional basis for newly arrived <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This applies especially at Geelong where, over a period, employment problems have militated against the need for or the desirability of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are seeking employment being brought directly into that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is considerable pressure from manufacturers and employer organisations within the Geelong area, and also from the Geelong Promotion Committee, to have the present hostel maintained as a transition centre for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a subject on which State and Commonwealth governments must have long discussions, for at the moment the major problem with transitional housing other than for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is that it is not needed for long periods and it is fairly expensive to provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to the Minister that it is of extreme importance to industry and to the development of the area for transitional accommodation to be provided for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are also important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1970, 321 apprentices and 1,152 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> became bricklayers in the building industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1971, there were 231 apprentices and 786 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> entering that industry of bricklayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1972, new bricklayers came from 231 apprentices and 620 <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this Government has done by its policy is actually to cut back on the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and so create an artificial  shortage which has increased the cost of housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How many assisted <span class="highlight">migrants</span> came from Italy to Australia during each month from December 1972 to date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many of these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were (a) single and  (b) people  with no relatives in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>&lt;5) From what areas, and in what numbers, did the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In what areas, and in what numbers, did these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> proceed to reside in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another point made toy the Minister for Social Security is that one of the main reasons why <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will not stay in Australia is that we do not have a universal health scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thousands and thousands of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> came to Australia because they believed that this was a free country, a country where the individual mattered, where the private life, thoughts, beliefs and relationships mattered and could matter in the most intimate and important of human relationships such as health care, education and similar matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tn the last few months this procedure resulted in many letters from British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> saying that they felt that it was misleading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other demographic areas such as Carlton and Richmond where there is a great number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are not yet naturalised and therefore cannot be placed on the roll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some areas, particularly in the capital cities, there are large concentrations of unnaturalised <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the appropriate way to determine the numbers of electors in each State division is by means of a quota of electors properly enrolled and legally entitled to vote, not the number of people including the very young - even .the one and 2-year- olders and up to the 17-year old group - and the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have not become naturalised citizens of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an example, in an area with 50,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, many of whom are not yet naturalised, with 25,000 of them voting and 25,000 Australians voting there would be an electorate with 75,000 people and 50,000 voters, a vote in which the actual voter would be worth 50 per cent more people than in an electorate with a predominantly Australian grouping. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As our population increased and as the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who came to this country increased, more and more responsibility was thrown onto local government, but no increase in the percentage of further financial resources was forthcoming from either the Australian Government or the respective State governments to assist local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The spread of our cities means that higher rates are paid mostly by the young and by the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who live in the newest parts of our municipalities and cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I firmly believe that we could double our present intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from that continent and that we could do so with great advantage to ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe very strongly that the quality of some of the prospective <span class="highlight">migrants</span> that are offering from a number of South American countries is far superior to that of some of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are presently coming to Australia to become permanent residents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those reasons I believe that we could with advantage increase our present level of intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have never believed that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> take jobs which would otherwise be available for Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> contribute very substantially to the home consumption of both our primary production and our manufactured products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the reasons I have stated, I believe that the contribution made by <span class="highlight">migrants</span> very greatly exceeds the cost of the demand they make on Australia or on the public purse for increased services by way of roads, water supply, power supply, hospitals, schools and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have to shop in that fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unskilled <span class="highlight">migrants</span> employed in those industries which were first to be hurt in the times of economic squeezes under the stop-go financial policies of the previous Government were the people least able to protect themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government recognises the difficulties that the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> face and will do its best to help them overcome their difficulties and become permanent settlers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Henty  (Mr Fox),  who was the previous  speaker  in the debate, made some remarks concerning the beneficial effects of our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and of the new settlers who have come to this country since World War II. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget estimates provide for an intake of 110,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> - and this is a moderate figure, as is the expenditure, being an increase of only $4m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in the development of post-arrival services for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> already here - and for those yet to come - that we see high priority given in the Budget figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the estimate for the Good Neighbour Council - this is a wonderful way of assisting <span class="highlight">migrants</span> - we find that $745,000 has been allocated and that last year $618,255 was actually spent in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to statements made recently by the management of the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd which said quite openly and frankly that it desired an intake of skilled <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to enable it to overcome the lag in the production of its goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So overseas <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, mostly European, have over the years made a great contribution to the development of Australia and have had a considerable influence on our national life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This wonderful country is surely in a most advantageous position to attract <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said before, we are in a position  to  screen our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to see that we get the best type educationally, physically, mentally and skilled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should also be accepting those <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are prepared to preserve our democratic way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must be able to house <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There must be good educational facilities and, as has already been mentioned, increased sums are being made available to educate the children of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and, indeed, the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government’s policy is for an immigration intake in 1973-74 of 110,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government proposes that the 110,000 settlers will comprise 60,000 assisted <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and 50,000 unassisted <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be giving more consideration to the integration of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> into the Australian community and not allowing them to congregate in settlements as they are prone to do in many part of our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This year there is a proposed intake of 110,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I should quote a single advertisement that appeared in Britain which, of course, has provided up to half the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia for a great many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The end result will be better for us and for the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We were in effect selecting <span class="highlight">migrants</span> like sausages with 20 minutes to have a look at them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a consequence the actual number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> was established at the maximum which was considered to be the nation’s capacity to absorb effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the peak of the program several years ago Australia was absorbing 180,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking to the future of this country, I ‘believethat we should be absorbing many more than 110,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the long term national interest the Government should make immediate and concerted efforts to attract more <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a matter of record that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have contributed significantly to the enrichment and development of the Australian way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are in a position today to invite to our shores as <span class="highlight">migrants</span> those whom we believe can most easily be assimilated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent months a number of rackets have been uncovered by the officers of the Department of Immigration which have involved bringing people to this country in circumstances which are clear exploitation of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have arrived, I will take into account the honourable member’s plea for compassion as far as they are concerned, and when we are in a position to make a determination I will let the honourable member know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the suggestion that was advanced by the honourable member, I did take up with my colleagues in relevant Australian Government departments the matter of checking whether their employees who were <span class="highlight">migrants</span> had been given adequate access to English classes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, I have been saying, and I believe most sincerely, that all major components of industry that are employing <span class="highlight">migrants</span> should provide language facilities for them, at least the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has advised me that he discovered that, in the Repatriation Department, more than 1,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from 60 different countries are employed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The placement of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this country is “within the role of the Minister for Immigration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> has he heard of who have bought houses in the excitement of the first arrival, obtained a job, then found that they are a long way from their place of employment and have wanted to sell their house to buy another? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is aware that in the last few years there has been some run down in the number of personnel who have been selected as <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from the United Kingdom to come to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many inner city suburbs where there are large families, where often 2 parents are working or where large concentrations of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are living, it is essential to provide satisfactory pre-school centres staffed by adequately trained teachers who can apply themselves to problems which face these young people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For some <span class="highlight">migrants</span> the requirement therefore represents a barrier to employment in the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to the greatly increased capital, recurrent and library grants which will apply to almost all students, there will be extra millions of dollars in each of these and other aspects of education for those in disadvantaged schools - children of lower income families, many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with low incomes and language and social adjustment problems, Aborigines and children living in isolated areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the problems of migrant education which has been highlighted by some people recently is that the children of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, and of recently arrived <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are involved in an environment at school which is in so many respects foreign to that which they have left behind in the old country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many children of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have special problems requiring specialist teaching. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, will the Minister ensure that better arrangements are made for transporting from South America <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are arriving in steady numbers at the present time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no possibility of the children of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in those circumstances achieving an equal opportunity in life in their new country unless the Commonwealth provides the resources to get more teachers, particularly specially trained teachers, and better accommodation and better equipment in the schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We must pay tribute to what <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have done in some of the inner suburban areas in taking old, broken down houses and refurbishing them, painting them and making them very attractive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor do I wish to see regional centres being developed as places where <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are directed only to escape later when they have served their period, as happened in earlier years when <span class="highlight">migrants</span> had to remain in a designated place for 2 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the principle of facilitating the settlement of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia as expres sed in the Albury-Wodonga Development Bill, but we must remain conscious of the fact that people must retain their freedom of choice to live wherever they want and to have the mobility to move from one place to another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> are mentioned specifically in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have played such a significant and crucial role in our history, has the Minister given consideration to the writing of a history of Australia, in which this role is given full recognition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is by no means clear that, even if the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were available, they would relieve the short-term strain on our resources to a greater extent than they would impose additional strains. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government health scheme would benefit only pensioners, <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, indolents, no-hopers and alcoholics, the Liberal Party welfare spokesman,  Mr Chipp,  said yesterday’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I said the present scheme gives preference in public hospitals to the poor, the pensioners, <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, indolents, drunks and no-hopers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are sorry that in 1973 the Opposition parties are revealed to hold social values which would require that a million Australians barter their dignity for their health and we are particularly sorry to note that the Liberal Party spokesman on social security has put those 1 million Australians together in one category and labelled them as ‘pensioners, the indolent, <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, no-hopers and alcoholics’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Several weeks ago I asked the Minister for Immigration a question regarding a racket involving illegal <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Colombia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I give the honourable member this assurance: I hope in the next few weeks to be able to determine the cases with a view to seeing that justice is done to the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 6 December in this House I made a personal explanation, which is reported at page 4377 of Hansard, where I said that I had been quoted in the Melbourne ‘Sun’ of that morning “ as saying that the Government Health scheme would benefit only pensioners, <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, indolents no-hopers and alcoholics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again, we are pledged to give equal opportunities to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>; no government has done more for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They include: Legislative Record of the Year; Reports Tabled in Parliament on Inquiries Instituted by the Present Government; Statements Arising from Meetings Between Australian Government and State Government Ministers; Committees; Commissions of Inquiry and Task Forces Reporting to the Government; Reports Tabled by the Present Government on Inquiries Instituted by Previous Governments and the record on Cities, Women, Social Security, Resources, Other Decisions, <span class="highlight">Migrants</span>, Rural Industries, the Economy, Education, the Environment and a Text of Treaties and so on presented to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The available evidence suggests that the uninsured population includes many poor people, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our global procedures are all designed to protect individual <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In respect of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, the effort has been singularly attractive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be remembered that Australia has received 3.1 million <span class="highlight">migrants</span> since the end of the last war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that there should be a reduction in Government spending; a progressive reduction in the interest rate structure; the provision of taxation relief for lower and middle income earners; a revision of the migration program to attract skilled and semi-skilled <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in areas in which labour today is in such scarce supply; the introduction of a retraining program to deal with the structural problems in the labour market; the introduction of a dual program to increase female job training opportunities and apprentice training schemes; the imposition of a growth limit on the Commonwealth Public Service; the abandonment of the pace-setter’ principle now applying to the Commonwealth Public Service; the introduction of a program of restraint for both wages and prices; the adoption of a flexible exchange rate policy to prevent a build-up of externally generated liquidity; the adoption of measures to increase the economy’s productive capacity; the flexible use of competitive policies; and the implementation of a national productivity program to narrow the gap between minimum money wage expectations and economic capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Immigration said: ‘I will ask the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council if I can bring in 20,000 more <span class="highlight">migrants</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now he advises that labour is of such short store that we need more <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Grassby,  of course, has made such a fool of himself that he will not be able to recruit the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> will not forget the door knocks which followed the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation fiasco last year when the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  raided ASIO headquarters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am aware that over the years there has been a growth of what I might describe as shysterism  in  relation to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I indicate the importance of this matter because many of the policy initiatives which the Minister for Immigration claims to have introduced in relation to the welfare of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia were policy initiatives formerly announced by my colleagues the honourable member for Barker  (Dr Forbes)  or the honourable member for Flinders  (Mr Lynch). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen police raids on migrant homes at night, the appalling record of the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  in the early days of the administration, and the summary court appearances of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> arrested in those raids, most of whom had the charges against them quashed in court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Special committees are now off to the Philippines and to South America to study the situation and to find suitable <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member’s question is apparently based on a recent report that there are 30,000 illegal <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was based on a figure, which it quoted, of 18,000 illegal <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who remained in Australia under the previous administration, having arrived between the years 1965 and 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The actual number of illegal <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from 1965 to 1972 amounted to no fewer than 25,000 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This question concerns details of immigration - it is question number 999  -  such as the number of people coming to Australia and the number of assisted <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the main categories of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> now coming into the country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From what categories of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and from what countries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But none of them were directed to the administrative changes in detail - the significant changes in visa proceedings and the consequences of those changes; how many people have taken advantage of the different matters which the Minister has introduced; the main categories of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming into the country; how many from each category come from each country, and matters of this kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To what extent is the Government actively seeking <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from the United States of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the present position of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from the traditional sources - the United Kingdom and Europe? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are dependants? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are skilled tradesmen or professional people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But on behalf of the Government I must say that we have abolished discriminations, but above all we have set out to preserve the aspirations as well as the rights of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I indicated the success of this policy the other day when I stated that the number of dissatisfied <span class="highlight">migrants</span> returning home has been reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The white-Australia policy was buried by previous governments which abolished the infamous dictation tests and quietly began to increase the annual intake of non-European <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead, I understand, the Government will move to recognise trade qualifications for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from South-East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major area of criticism relating to the Australian Government’s actions on the question of skilled Filipino <span class="highlight">migrants</span> concerns the lack of provision of adequate administrative measures to ensure that the scheme functions smoothly and is not harmful to either the participants or to Australian workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Australia today there is a very heavy demand for metal and electrical tradesmen; so heavy indeed is the demand that we believe it warrants the selection of such tradesmen as <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So long as the car manufacturers can get <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from overseas in rotten, soul destroying conditions they will never bother to do anything about job enrichment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ‘Age’ of 25 February 1974 carried this heading ‘Minister “encourages illegal <span class="highlight">migrants</span>” ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They represent a bold change from the 20-year-old Liberal-Country Party policy of refusing to advertise for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the United States for fear of Negro applicants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We must remember that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are not sheep. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main policy on which they seemed to base the annual intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> was to try to exceed the intake achieved by the preceding Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it true, as alleged at the weekend, that there is difficulty in breaking down the figures for family reunion <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and those arriving under the national need category because the biggest group of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> arriving in Australia is completely uncontrolled, unselected and indeed not even interviewed, that is, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Britain, Canada and New Zealand? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other day I saw a report which stated that category C applications - the national need <span class="highlight">migrants</span> - had to be referred back to Australia if the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were non-European or of mixed descent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the other matter, the free flow of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, what the honourable member says is right, and I must acknowledge it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I understand him correctly, he said that it is not possible properly to arrange both reception and the categorisation of free flow <span class="highlight">migrants</span> because we have no notice of them, no arrangements for them, and this is a continuing problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite true that at the moment we cannot do that, but I hope that at a later stage this year we will be able to take care of that matter, that we will be able to arrange for all <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to be properly counselled, properly put into their categories and properly assisted on arrival. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is even confusion as to the basis on which there is opportunity for Europeans to become <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that the Minister in the field of migration has alleged that earlier administrations permitted people to come into Australia who have had backgrounds of a criminal character and who were undesirable <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that invading persons’ homes in the early hours of the morning is a necessary way by which <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, illegal or legal, should be approached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that in this country there are many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who came from coutnries which are communist controlled and those from Fiji obviously- even the Minister might know this - do not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My point is that many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia have come from communist countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fourth thing I wanted to say is that it is necessary that there should be an exposition and a valid exposition, abroad and internally, of the way in which the easy visa system applies and the implications for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already commented that I do not see that asking a series of questions of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, or of any individual, will necessarily ensure that one gets the correct answers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret the quota restraints that are being applied in relation to the present number of persons coming to Australia as intending permanent <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that given the labour shortages, particularly in key areas, there is a need for us to return to the fairly extensive system which applied a few years ago when <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were encouraged to enter Australia from many countries in Europe - persons who I believe have given a great deal towards establishing the Australian idiom in its present form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret that this year there has been a continued curtailment in the quantum of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is again time for us to increase significantly the intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> so that Australia can again get about the business of developing a European character, of growing in a total sense and of bringing to this country those people who are prepared to work and who might be prepared to get the country moving forward again instead of, regrettably, moving backwards as the comprehensive policies of this Government tend to lead us to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a fall in the numbers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first irresponsible statement that he made was that 30,000 illegal <span class="highlight">migrants</span> had arrived in Australia under the easy visa system in the past 7 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course this was compounded at the same time by raids on the homes of several new Australian <span class="highlight">migrants</span> - raids which, to the best of my knowledge, while they apparently resulted in certain records and material being taken from those homes did not, in any instance, result in a successful prosecution against any of these individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were raids which brought to those new Australian <span class="highlight">migrants</span> a facsimile of that way of life from which they had escaped - many of them from communist-dominated societies to which this Government in its foreign policy, :md particularly the Minister for Overseas <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a particular need and one which I would have thought would have been obvious even to the Minister, who has so many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in his own electorate, which adjoins mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has particular regard to the needs of women, of country students, of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and of handicapped persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and community interest; greater flexibility in entry requirements and in attendance requirements; particular attention should be paid to adapting technical and further education to the needs of women, handicapped, country students and <span class="highlight">migrants</span>; the development of further education - the concept ranging from adult literacy and primary education to advanced studies and technology as an integral part of the education structure open to all; the provision of better means of pre-service teacher education, in consultation with the Commission on Advanced Education; the report seeks to foster community colleges in country areas - multi-level institutions combining technical and advanced education courses and avoiding unnecessary duplication, the funding to be in the hands of the Commission primarily responsible for the particular courses, in consultation with the other; technical colleges should contribute to developing new approaches to apprenticeship training; initial programs are designed to upgrade existing technical colleges, improve educational quality, and lay foundations for substantial improvements in the next triennium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Far too often in the past, particularly in the engineering field, skilled <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with a great knowledge of higher mathematics have ‘been unable to have their skills recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All honourable members have <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this category living in their electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At 2 March 1974 there were 4,226 people in receipt of Special Benefit including 50 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in accommodation centres awaiting first placement in employment in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are: protection for the weaker sections of the  community;  a firm, commitment to the principle of full  employment;  equity in sharing sacrifices as well as prosperity; and the need to ensure that any deferment of expectations shall not be made at the expense of those for whom deferment could mean a lifetime of deprivation - for example, children at school and <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government intends to extend the provisions of the income taxation laws governing deductions for dependants to provide that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> maintaining dependant relatives oversesas shall be entitled to the taxation advantages which are already available to those maintaining dependant relatives in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has his attention been drawn to reports today which suggest that the arrival of more than 130 Spanish <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Brisbane has given rise to fears by State Labor Party leaders and trade union leaders that Australia’s immigration policy will aggravate the local employment situation there? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can he reassure honourable members that there is no likelihood that the arrival of these Spanish <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Brisbane will lead to an aggravation of the unemployment situation in the Brisbane area? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am waiting for the final result but I am assured that the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> concerned would have b;en specially selected to do skilled work for which there were plenty of vacancies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those principles, most of which have guided the Australian Labor Party for many years, are: Protection of the weaker sections of the community; a firm commitment to the principles of full employment; equity in sharing sacrifices as well as in sharing prosperity; and, lastly, the need to ensure that any deferment of expectations will not be made at the expense of those for whom deferment could mean a lifetime of deprivation - for example, children at school and <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immigration policy, particularly when it relates to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who want to enter the work force, must play an important part in the formulation of manpower policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The likely employment prospects for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and their families are surely an important consideration in ensuring that the migrant is satisfactorily integrated into the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is true for both assisted and unassisted <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We simply cannot view <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as a source of unskilled labour for this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The introduction of NEAT will provide enhanced opportunities for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would strengthen the resources of the Department of Labor - a policy which the Minister has now adopted - to enable adequate research and advisory facilities to be established to identify obstacles to equal opportunity, especially for women and for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, and advise methods to overcome them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The retraining scheme ought to have a particular impact in overcoming some of the problems of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> for whom the Minister is now directly responsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Liberal and Country Party Government would review the special situation of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to ensure that they were neither disadvantaged nor discriminated against because of lack of training, as I believe some are at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many problems of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> which the Department of Labor and Immigration is illequipped to deal with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many problems for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> settling in Australia, and matters which to them appear to be difficult and which cause concern to them are matters that we might take for granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the question of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, Karmel did regard migrancy and Aboriginality as signs of disadvantage in a school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The impact that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have had on Australia’s social, cultural and economic life, particularly since the Second World War, has been immense and worth while. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the expansion of the definition of what constitutes family reunion has led to a remarkable increase in the number of sponsored <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and a corresponding increase in those falling into the unskilled category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The growth in sponsorship and applications which at this stage have not yet been reflected in arrival figures, simply because of the administrative complexity of processing applications, could have very real effects on the composition and opportunities for employment of future <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been asserted that the present policies in respect of categorisation of sponsored <span class="highlight">migrants</span> could soon lead to effective lack of control over total migrant numbers entering Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Government has initiated a policy which will lead to a lack of control by the Government over the total numbers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming into this country, it is a very real responsibility which the Government will have to bear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The difficulties of assimilation and integration of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> travelling to a new country are severe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Problems are experienced by <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from the time they enter Australia right through to and including the process of settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For 25 years officers within that Department, who had a personal knowledge of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and ready access to full documentation in relation to individual <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, were available to help them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> felt that in this new and often strange environment they had a ready symbol of the Government’s concern for their particular problems - one they could turn to for assistance and one they knew. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> know that the inter-related nature of their problems can best be dealt with by a co-ordinated administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> feel that they have been betrayed by the dismemberment of the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has achieved uncertainty and confusion amongst the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, making their task of assimilation that much more difficult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Long before that unhappy day comes he will find that the present Department of Labor and Immigration has been so well integrated and will be working so well that to give him the portfolio that he is striving to obtain would be to create enormous chaos and impose upon the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> unnecessary hardships and disadvantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One good reason is that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> more than anything else want the right to be able to get a good job when they come to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is terribly important to the future of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> that they have close contact with a department that can provide them with suitable employment or, if suitable employment is not available for the type of training that they have had, that the department can provide training for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the honourable gentleman did not mention - and I do not blame him for not mentioning it because it would have gone right against his case - is that the main competitor with Australia for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is Canada which does have manpower and migration integrated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It works so well that Canada obtains many more <span class="highlight">migrants</span> than we do, much to our ill-content. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we were looking for more <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, we found that Canada was able to get more than we could. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people of the city are taxpayers, be they <span class="highlight">migrants</span> or otherwise, and they are making their contribution to make this country great, yet the Opposition wants to deny them the opportunity to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no doubt that since coming to office this Government has sought consistently to remove all forms of discrimination from our laws, whether it be discrimination against women, Aborigines, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> or in the various other forms that it appears in our statutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people on low incomes, especially <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, are not receiving the level of medical and hospital care that they really need in the best interests of their health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Under the existing health scheme the Liberal-Country Party Government progressively closed the gaps as they were found to exist and it assisted those low income groups, such as <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and pensioners, to have health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am informed that immediately or very shortly after the Minister received the request from the Landall company, he decided to revoke the 2 rules which the Ministers for Immigration had previously agreed upon so that there would no longer be the necessity, which previously would have operated, of letting <span class="highlight">migrants</span> know something about the law before they entered into these contracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since the commencement of that program about 2.5 million <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have come to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  announced in a Press release dated 6 June 1974 that there had been established the Australian Legal Office whose stated purpose is:  to provide legal advice and assistance to the socially deprived and people for whom the Australian Government has a special responsibility such as those on social services, Aborigines, ex-servicemen and <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the next few days we are going to be privileged as a parliament to receive a Bill which will seek to extend to the whole of the people of Australia, whether they are ex-servicemen or <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, no matter who they are, the right to one of the basic freedoms for which every parliament and every government should strive, freedom from want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another group which will be grossly disadvantaged by the Government’s decision to reduce the taxation deduction are the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could not say that the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are amongst the higher income bracket in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A tremendous number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have a wish and a very strong compulsion to send thier children to particular sectarian schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only are these people affected by the economic policies of the present Government because they are usually the ones who get sacked first- if one looks at the unemployment figures one will find that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are the hardest hit of any section of the community by the present unemployment wave- but also they will be doubly hit because their taxation deductions for education of their children attending independent schools that they previously claimed will now be taken away from them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So do not let this Government say that it is the defender of the rights of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> any more, because in fact it is working against the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the principal obstacles has been the fact that the Iraqi Government has not been prepared to validate would be <span class="highlight">migrants</span>’ passports for travel to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what do we find now under the Labor Government, which, I might add, came to power professing to have the interests of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> at heart? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, there is the effect on the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an actual effect on the welfare of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be very much more difficult to administer the many problems which beset <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have come to Australia recently or who have been here for some time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be very much more difficult to administer those things which go to make life more easy for the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have come to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be very much less flexibility in the approaches which can be made to the many problems which beset individual <span class="highlight">migrants</span> when they come here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be a very great diminution of the ability to react to the unusual circumstances which often arise extremely quickly- for instance, with the arrival of an aeroplane bringing <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia, although, of course, under the administration of the present Labor Government the arrival of aeroplanes bringing <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is a very rare occurrence these days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter to which ethnic group in the community they belong, as a section of the community the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> feel that they are being downgraded because the former Department, which had so much influence in their lives and had such a very real appreciation of the problems that they, as individual <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, face, has been broken up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The results of changing policies which affect <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and migration matters are often not worked out until many years in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, I believe that Australia now has a greater number than ever before of illegal <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That newspaper also published an advertisement attributed to the New Settlers Federation calling upon illegal <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to contact a  Mr Lianos  if they wanted to stay in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My advice to any illegal <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who may contemplate approaching the New Settlers Association in response to the advertisement mentioned earlier is simply that they will find they have been ill advised and any money they may pass over to the New Settlers Association will be money that will be worse than wasted because it will be money that will put them into the clutches of an organisation whose interest in their cases will prejudice rather than help their future prospects in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the only thing that we disagreed on were the numbers, the way in which <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were to be brought to Australia and like matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to Australia, particularly in the last 12 months, has gradually decreased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>We were told by the former Minister for Immigration that the future policy would be based on family reunions and that this would play a very important role in relation to incoming <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Australia has almost 2 million <span class="highlight">migrants</span> resident here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that most of these <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, because of the environment, are happy here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is gradually being taken away for 2 very definite reasons: first, the reduction in the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>; and second, the broadened policy based on non-discrimination and an ability to occupy a position in an industry with little thought for the long term future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I gather that Sydney and then Melbourne hostels were filled with so-called Chilean <span class="highlight">migrants</span> after the coup in Chile with the final overflow of 52 going to Adelaide and 142 going to Brisbane and smaller numbers going to Perth and Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These <span class="highlight">migrants</span> come from a pool that  Senator Murphy  described in a statement tabled on 21 March this year as:  …. required by the present regime to leave Chile for political reasons or due to irregular resident status . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is also interesting to note in passing that the signatory countries had by then granted asylum to several hundred people and yet over the next 9 months this country took in 1,500 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> when the missions of other countries had ceased selecting from the pool, presumably on proper screening procedures adopted by those nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have strong evidence from Foreign Affairs sources pointing to the fact that these immigrants to Australia were improperly screened and I strongly doubt the statement made by  Senator Murphy  in clause 18 of his paper where he says: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, there has been a long-standing invitation over 7 years by the  President  of Italy for the head of the Australian Government to visit that country- the country from which the greatest number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have come other than from Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amount provided for special groups such as Aborigines, <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, soldiers’ children and isolated children, will be cut by $5.46m and if the amount payable to colleges of” advanced education and teachers’ colleges were included in the 8 per cent, expenditure in these areas would be cut by $25.6m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In October the Minister for Labor and Immigration  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  said in a Press statement that he could not responsibly approve the entry of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who were likely to experience difficulty in finding and holding employment and who would be competing with Australians and <span class="highlight">migrants</span> already here in the tight sections of the labour market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In abolishing the Department of Immigration it is clear that the Australian Labor Party, despite its earlier protests, believes that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> should be treated as cannon fodder for industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the statement to which I referred previously, issued by the Minister for Labour and Immigration on 2 October, one will see that he said that it would be damaging and he would be acting contrary to the Australian Labor Party’s platform if he were to bring <span class="highlight">migrants</span> here at this time when we cannot ensure that they will find long term employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he could see that they were short term problems that would face prospective <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, why did he not say so? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a concern not only of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and the people here in Australia but also of those many thousands of people whose aspirations were raised by this Government in the belief that they could find a new home here in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am informed that the answer to the right honourable member’s question is as follows:  (1), (2) and (3) The Government has accepted the recommendation of the Working Party established to examine the question of the distribution of certain functions previously carried out by the former Department of Immigration that a Standing Interdepartmental Committee should be established to ensure a continued, co-ordinated and integrated approach to all matters relating to immigration and the welfare of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-81-87">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the meantime liaison has been established where necessary with other Departments to ensure that the interests of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will continue to be properly served. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-81-87">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) and (2) For many years a range of booklets has been provided in 17 languages to inform prospective <span class="highlight">migrants</span> overseas about living conditions in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-81-115">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> have been asked to study these booklets and to bring them to Australia, where copies are also available at offices of the Department of Labor and Immigration for further reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-81-115">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The publications distributed to prospective <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are: ‘Australia’ ‘Assisted Passages to Australia ‘ ‘Your Journey to Australia ‘ ‘Customs and Quarantine in Australia’ ‘ Migrant Accommodation in Australia ‘ ‘Employment in Australia’ ‘ Housing in Australia ‘ ‘ Education in Australia ‘ ‘Health and Social Security in Australia’ ‘ Wages, Prices and Taxes in Australia ‘ ‘ Health Insurance in Australia ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-81-115">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, in 1974-75, the estimated cost of printing information booklets in English for prospective <span class="highlight">migrants</span> overseas is $130,000 and, in 16 other languages, $250,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-81-115">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his wonderful achievements in the external fields, why was it that in one country alone on his visit- I refer to Holland- he was prepared to accept in his discussions on immigration that there should be a preparedness by the Australian Government to consider an increase in <span class="highlight">migrants</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They could include, according to the Bill, ex-servicemen, <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, Aborigines, Commonwealth public servants, contractors working for the Federal Government and persons in receipt of a Commonwealth pension; that is, aged persons, widows, deserted wives, supporting mothers, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I instance <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has become apparent in recent times through surveys which have been conducted by this Government that the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> of Australia have been discriminated against by the providers of houses in most Australian States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great service could result from the provision of units for these groups of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and other disadvantaged groups within the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, it can directly house <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, students, Aborigines, persons engaged in work for the Australian Government and residents of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the Australian Government has always been active in providing financial assistance for housing to certain groups in the community, including the poor, the aged, <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, Aborigines and suitably qualified past and present members of the armed Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor is it the intention of the Government that the activities of the Australian Housing Corporation should conflict in any way with established policy on the provision of housing for particular groups, such as <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, students or Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, that is a specific case:  <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, students, Aborigines- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However the Corporation would be able to build dwellings for Commonwealth employees, <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, students, those who are in receipt of family allowances for these purposes and those who are also in receipt of advances or loans from the Director of Defence Service Homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everybody knows that there is no inhibition at all in respect of the provision of houses for people in the Territories or for Aborigines, <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, servicemen, ex-servicemen, students and for certain recipients of social security benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since then he had campaigned for a resumption of transportation which would bring further distress to the thousands of free <span class="highlight">migrants</span> already unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are various <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia and it behoves none of us to exacerbate feelings between those <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has particular regard for the needs of women, of country students, of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, and of handicapped persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first people to become unemployed are unskilled, non-English-speaking <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A local government authority submitted to the Grants Commission recently among other proposals in support of its need for extra funds the proposition that one of its housing estates contained mainly English and Irish <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who were bad debtors with respect to council rates as 20 per cent of that authority’s non-payers came from the estate in question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has, as I have already mentioned, particularly since the Second World War conducted a massive campaign to seek and welcome <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from a great number or countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the main, whilst many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will be able to complain of individual instances of prejudice or discrimination that they personally have experienced, Australia has developed with their help and effort, largely free from significant racial or cultural prejudice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at division after division in New South Wales we will find that the informal vote is highest where there is the highest concentration of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, and this is because political Parties ignore the spending of money on avenues that may be of influence in the migrant communities, or cannot afford it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The electorate of Sydney, which has a high concentration of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, had a 20 per cent informal vote at the 1974 Senate election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Priority will also be given to families in economic or other distress, and to groups with particular needs such as Aborigines, <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, handicapped children and isolated children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The section I would like to bring forward today for some degree of emphasis relates to migrant children or the children of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the problems being experienced by migrant children or the children of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>- they are not necessarily the same thing- one is impressed by the immensity of the situation in terms of the total number involved and the immensity of the situation in terms of the spread of disadvantages within that particular group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, I would like to see people of an ethnic background appointed to advisory committees or supervisory committees, people who have an intimate knowledge, who themselves were <span class="highlight">migrants</span> or the children of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who really have a first-hand working knowledge of the problems which these people face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, although this Curriculum Development Centre only applies, as I understand it, to teaching in schools- and, therefore would only apply to school children- this problem of education which faces <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is not confined to children at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appeal to the Minister in his attitude and in his talks with his advisers and his officers to look at the inclusion of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> on advisory or supervisory committees, and I urge that we keep very much in mind the problems being experienced by this very large group of Australians or soon-to-be Australians, the migrant children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said that we must remove barriers discouraging adults from further education and we must have particular regard for the needs of women, of country students, of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and of handicapped persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This should remove barriers discouraging adults and it should have particular regard for the needs of women, country students, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and handicapped persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The public does not seem to be aware that the Australian Legal Aid Office will give legal advice and also give legal assistance by way of instituting court proceedings to people who are eligible for such assistance, being people of limited means or people for whom the Australian Government has a special responsibility such as pensioners, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> or infants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For very many years a significant proportion or our imports and exports have flowed along one or other of these 2 trade routes, and most of our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> also have come to us across the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within other areas under my authority there are units which perform tasks which could be regarded as research and development, for example, the development of language teaching materials for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, within my Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is another one which I consider to be very important, and that is the problems of groups such as <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, women, apprentices and other such groups in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another group of people who were omitted were <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who had purchased their home within 3 years of arrival. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you get children of old Australians unable to find work, seeing <span class="highlight">migrants</span> getting jobs, there could be sociological problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That will stop illegal <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and will stop people from cheating the Government in more ways than one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one of the reasons why it catches up more quickly than we do with illegal <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The residents on both sides share the same problems- the squeeze of business and industrial premises against residential areas, displacement by freeway construction, the decline in the quality of urban life, large numbers of pensioners and <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of them are <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from non-Christian communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a marked increase in the population; there has been an alteration to the Commonwealth Electoral Act to provide for 18-year-olds to vote instead of having to wait until they reach 2 1 years of age; and <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have been given the right to obtain citizenship after 3 years residence in Australia instead of having to wait for 5 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rights of the smaller people, people with very specific problems such as the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are submerged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am pleased to see some reference to the problems in respect to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, there is a difference in the criteria for admission of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Vietman which applied before there was a change of government in Vietnam, and the evacuees from Vietnam who are now within American jurisdiction on the one hand and the refugees on the other hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The criteria for the admission of refugees are obviously wider than the criteria for the admission of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> or evacuees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take the honourable member for Bradfield  (Mr Connolly)  to task for what he said about the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as applied to Vietnamese <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>People who are applying include those who have not had the opportunity to be trained in their youth, who have not had the opportunity to have a reasonable education, new settlers to this country, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from other parts of the world who have not had the opportunity to be trained in the skills required in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact is that  Mr Gismondi  was an army officer in the country of which he is a citizen and as we are not seeking army officers as <span class="highlight">migrants</span> at present he did not meet the occupational conditions for migrant entry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instead the Government is going to help only public servants, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and other people in limited categories because it is so suspicious about co-operating with the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Mulvihill, Vice Chairman of the Federal Labor Party’s Immigration Committee, said in an address entitled  Refugees in the World Today  delivered on Thursday of last week, that is, 28 August:  … the sympathy, understanding and tolerance with which the Government’s policies are administered apply no less strongly to refugees than to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> can come to Australia, stand on any street corner and say what they wish about other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would this action lead to the screening of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the economic conditions of today not many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are being permitted to enter Australia, even for family reunions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But all those <span class="highlight">migrants</span> could be screened and could be forced to sign an undertaking not to speak about politics which are not to the liking of the government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have passed the stage of forcing our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to be second class citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This action is a direct attack on the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> of Australia and they ought properly to resent it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a protection to the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has tried to suggest that an undertaking required of 6 former diplomats and 3 former senior officers of the South Vietnamese Army is in some way an attack on all <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and is in some way an attack on the civil liberties of all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know what his attitude to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and migrant problems has been in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government will oppose discrimination against <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and will guarantee no discrimination against <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hasten to say that in years this Government has done more to guarantee an end to discrimination against <span class="highlight">migrants</span> than our friends did in the 23 years of their Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When did the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar),  who began this debate or the second  speaker  from the Opposition side, the right honourable member for Bruce, bring in any legislation or any administrative machinery to prevent discrimination against <span class="highlight">migrants</span> or, for that matter, anybody else? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a massive increase in the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> seeking citizenship since honourable members opposite left office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After aU, it could be said that we have suffered from the activities of a great number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia who have used Australia as a launching pad for abuse and sometimes for incursions against other countries with which we have correct and proper relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that honourable members must have shared my experience on numerous occasions when pensioners, <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, disadvantaged people of one type or another, have urgently required legal advice and sometimes legal representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This racket was within the law, even if just within it, but the people who were victims were largely <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that a project has been approved by the Minister for Social Security under the Australian Assistance Plan whereby more than $20,000 has been granted to the Western Metropolitan Adelaide Region for Social Development to expand volunteer, home English-teaching for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-53-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The grant was to provide for the expansion of a voluntary home English teaching program for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and related research and publicity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-53-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> have been granted the right to obtain citizenship after 3 years of residence in Australia instead of after 5 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Legal Aid Office will also provide legal aid for the culturally and socially disadvantaged, for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as well as community groups and for the inarticulate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The education of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and Aborigines is another area that claims priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Library services in foreign languages are seen also as part of community education insofar as it relates to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, and this functionally is the responsibility of the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its terms of reference include inquiry into specialised library services including service to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> of all age groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that no group in the community would be more vulnerable to potential disaster brought on by a downturn in employment opportunities than <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and members of ethnic communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The numbers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>- this is most significantreturning home is increasing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As in so many areas much was promised to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and Australians of migrant background. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After listening to some members of the Government party, one wonders just where they stand in relation to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that statement needs some further explanation by the honourable member for Hunter who referred to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this country as scum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the honourable member for Hunter should be more explicit as to what he really means because he refers in his comments to the fact that 75 per cent of our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are scum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the economic situation in Australia, the Government has found it necessary to impose occupational restrictions on the entry of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> other than those qualifying as the spouse, dependent children, aged or dependent parents or fiances of Australian residents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must remember also that a big reduction has occurred in the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we were to revert to the former situation and if we sought to increase the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> entering Australia to up to 180 000, how would officers of the Department of Labor and Immigration be able to cope if they cannot handle the few <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are coming to Australia now? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are enough of these <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, another school and another hospital may be required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We owe a great debt of gratitude to our <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also wish to say a few words about the migration policies of this Government when one hears members of the Opposition decrying the efforts of this Government and when one looks back at the 23 years in which the conservative governments of this country dumped the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> on our doorstep and hoped that everything would work out well for them as they entered the community, as they became the human fodder for the mass industries of this country and as they became the forgotten people one realises that this Government has done far more in its short term of office to assist those people once they have arrived in this country than the conservative forces did in 23 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the first government that has recognised that the problems of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> do not stop once they set foot on these shores. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government seems to be of the opinion that if we admit <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to this country they will take jobs away from Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the contrary, <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, besides bringing many skills to this country, as they have done in the past, would create jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By imposing the present restrictions on the inflow of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to this country the Government has failed to improve the employment situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government maintains that Australia, at the present time, is incapable of sustaining an increase of more than 40 000 immigrants a year, despite the opinion of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation that the present capacity of Australia’s food energy resources is sufficient to support 37 million people immediately- three times our present population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today our population is almost double that figure and Australia is immensely enriched by the skills which <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have brought to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of us, as members acting on behalf of constituents, have seen people who would have made good <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and excellent Australians refused entry to this country- people who could have contributed greatly to Australia’s future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Earlier this evening my colleague the honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young)  mentioned the lack of concern for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> once they were settled in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a significant feature of the immigration policy under the previous Government, to such and extent that by the time we of the Australian Labor Party came to office in December 1972 some 25 per cent of our annual migrant intake was being lost by wastage of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> returning to their home countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among those valuable initiatives was the decision to appoint a committee of the Immigration Advisory Council to inquire into and report upon the extent of discrimination and exploitation of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, with particular emphasis on their use of community resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interim report the Committee put particular emphasis on several aspects of community concern for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and highlighted several areas in which discrimination was practised against <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It remains to be seen whether there has been acceptance by courts, police, hospitals and other bodies in contact with the public of any obligation to provide trained interpreters to facilitate their dealing with <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been of serious concern to those interested in the welfare of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until such time as action is taken to revise the present nationality criteria, non-British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are being discriminated against in that they are cut off from obtaining permanent employment in Government services in some circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I believe that it should be regarded by the Government as a matter of urgency that this one area of discrimination against newly arrived <span class="highlight">migrants</span> should be eliminated by the positive action of the Government to give equal employment opportunities in the Public Service to all Australian citizens regardless of their ability to handle effectively the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They cannot look after themselves completely, but they are better able to look after themselves than are the pensioners, the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, the illiterate people, the undereducated and people with poor incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all that time there were significant numbers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They seek to disguise their contempt for the underprivileged, <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, people on social security and the inarticulate by the shoddy, back-door device of sending the Legal Aid Bill into oblivion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People in this latter group would be, for instance, students, Aborigines and <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of that number 35.5 per cent were in the family law area; 24 per cent were concerned with problems related to Federal law; 21.5 per cent were conducted with pensioners and 8 per cent with <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What about the problems of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> which have been serviced now by the present Legal Aid Office? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As it is, the federal legal aid program proposed in this BUI will be limited constitution.ally to all matters arising under federal law and to people to whom the Federal Parliament has a special responsibility, such as Aborigines, students, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And the vast majority of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are poor and cannot afford the cost of adequate representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Because if you look at the figures for informal votes in New South Walesyou have looked at them, which is why you are trying to consolidate the present system in its present form- you will find that in the electorates where there was the highest number of informal votes the people who have been penalised are, to be a very large extent, the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, the disadvantaged groups and the groups which may have some difficulty in voting from one to seventythree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether the honourable member for Port Adelaide had any justification in suggesting that a lot of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>- I think that is what he saidcast informal votes at the last Senate election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to offer a special employment counselling and placement service to school leavers, the handicapped, older workers, discharged servicemen, ex-prisoners, aborigines and <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-44-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is worth emphasising that following the undertaking contained in his policy speech on 29 April 1974 the Prime Minister established a commission of inquiry under  Mr Justice  Hope to conduct a judicial inquiry into the structure of the Australian security service and into methods of reviewing decisions adversely affecting citizens or <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, 8 per cent were <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happens, might I ask the learned Attorney-General  (Mr Enderby),  when a person seeking assistance is confronted with a legal matter involving both State and Commonwealth law and that person does not fall within the particular class of persons comprehended by Commonwealth law- for example, pensioners, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and the like? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is intended to be in areas principally where pensioners, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and low income earners are found. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members should place themselves in the position of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have come to this country expecting opportunities to work, expecting that if they show enterprise, thrift and initiative and if they work hard they will be able to gain some reward for it and make a better life for themselves but more particularly for their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government recognises the major contribution that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have made to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my electorate we have a large number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As in other electorates our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have contributed greatly to the growth of important towns such as Queanbeyan and Cooma. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was pleased to hear the Governor-General say in his speech that the Government recognises the major contribution that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have made to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that bears out the fact that the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have brought into this country since the last major war have greatly helped this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in my area greatly enrich our culture, in the snowfields, in Cooma and in the restaurants of Queanbeyan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know the worth of our <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was very pleased to see that Australia once again will benefit from forward looking policies towards <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, forward looking policies related to encouraging interpreter centres, encouraging consultative groups with ethnic groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eligible persons comprise certain low income families, persons in receipt of social security, unemployment, sickness and special benefits, and <span class="highlight">migrants</span> during their first 2 months in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is probably the largest cross section of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and ethnic groups in Australia- British, Greek, Italian, Macedonian, Yugoslav, Croatian, Lebanese and substantial Chinese and Philippines communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that this was a very brave thing for him to have done because he represents a Party whose treatment of refugees and illegal <span class="highlight">migrants</span> has been nothing short of disgraceful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that every country has within its borders at any one time a number of illegal <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who fit into these categories as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At any one time the average number of illegal <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia is said to be around 7000 to 9000 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Significantly, it is in the area of Melbourne the city in which the honourable member resides, the city in which he made the statement that he had told illegal immigrants to hold off; in fact the city with the most <span class="highlight">migrants</span> that the numbers are not as high one would have hoped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The persons would have to undergo a medical examination, like all other <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would set back those people who genuinely have been waiting to come to Australia as legal <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me tell him about an appeals tribunal in Canada which has a situation in relation to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> roughly similar to that which we have in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His first comment was on what he termed the disgraceful treatment of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, refugees and the like by the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he goes among the migrant community- in view of what he said, obviously he has not been there yet- he will find that it was not until the advent of the Labor Government in 1972 that the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this country were elevated from a position in which they were brought here to do the dirty tasks, the unpleasant tasks and to fill the gaps in the factories in jobs which Australian people were a bit loath to take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then went on to attack the easy visa system and he blamed that system as the reason for there being, on his own admission, some 32 500 ‘illegal’ <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister is sincere and does intend to get to the bottom of this very knotty problem he will first of all withdraw the statement that the Labor Party treated <span class="highlight">migrants</span> disgracefully. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I freely concede that I have given to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in my own office the reported advice of the honourable member for Melbourne, that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> should hold off, as quoted by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like the honourable member for Melbourne I have a very large number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> living in my electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can give the Minister names- I do not intend to do so- of many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who entered this country by various means and who are living here, undetected so far, in fear of a knock on the door. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If my memory serves me correctly the Minister mentioned that some 4000 people out of a total known number of 32 500 illegal <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this country have applied for amnesty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As he claimed that the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have come forward under the amnesty this time have been motivated to do so by the pilot scheme which his Government introduced 2 years ago, it might be appropriate to remind the House that, when this Government came to office, there were people who had come forward in 1974 under the Grassby amnesty scheme whose applications still had not been completely processed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter for discussion concerns <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will mean that at the end of the 3 month period for which an amnesty has been declared those illegal immigrants who have not come forward might be deported if they are found. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opposition members claim to be the only people who care about <span class="highlight">migrants</span> but I would like to put on the record the undertaking which was forced upon the people who fled the communists in South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite its action, Labor claimed to have been a friend of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, they were substantially <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and workers, people who traditionally do not get help from conservative governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can one blame the unfortunate <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, the school leavers, older people and women who find themselves unemployed for hating him when they are spoken of as bludgers, cheats and long-hairs who should undergo more rigid testing and regimentation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Being an electorate primarily of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, old people and employees it received great gains under our policies allowing huge increases in pensions, migrant services, housing for the aged and general social welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the years Australia has received hundreds of thousands of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, in the main from <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The axe has already been felt, and those who have suffered are those least able to defend themselves- the pre-school children, the pensioners, the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, the poor and the disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the traditional sources of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> drying up, due partly to improving conditions in Europe and partly to an increasing awareness of the realities of living in Australia, the conservative Government turned to Turkey to keep up the numbers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During that period the Kensington group, which represents a wide spread of Turkish <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, formed their own social welfare group, hired their own premises and conducted a survey of their community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its attitude to the poor could best be summed up as: ‘Serves them right for being born poor or for being born <span class="highlight">migrants</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have heard reports of people and organisations who have cautioned those <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who come within the terms of the amnesty recently announced by the Government not to come forward to take advantage of the offer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the whole community accepted the principle of a concession to people on lower incomes, to people on social security benefits of various sorts or to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> after the first two or three months of their arrival in the country- I forget the period, but it is not very relevant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It applied to the short period after <span class="highlight">migrants</span> arrived and were necessarily settling in and getting themselves a job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of the honourable member for Maribyrnong  (Dr Cass),  it was for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the first 2 months after their arrival in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposal is unfortunate for people on low incomes, recipients of unemployment and sickness benefits and new <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been mentioned, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were covered for only 2 months anyway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people include those on unemployment, sickness or special benefits paid under the Social Services Act, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> during their first 2 months in Australia and families on low incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assessment of eligibility under the subsidised health benefits plan and the issue of SHB entitlement certificates are carried out by the Department of Social Security, not the Department of Health, in respect of all these groups with the exception of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> whose certificates are issued by the Department of Immigration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was an unemployment directly consequential on Labor’s disregard for the facts of life, an unemployment which harmed most of all the weak, the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, the poorthose sections of the Australian community which have sometimes looked upon the Australian Labor Party as their protector and which turned in their tens of thousands to us because of disillusion and dismay in December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of them, like me, are <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations aware that the cutbacks implemented by the Government in the Public Service sector have adversely affected the work of the Commonwealth Arbitration Inspectorate, to the extent that workers in general- and <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and rural workers in particular- will be at the mercy of unscrupulous employers who will be more able to abrogate their obligation to meet standard award wages and conditions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Almost every cutback in expenditure he has introduced has been aimed at the weakest and least protected groups in our communitythe pensioners, the Aborigines, the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, the people who are trying to re-establish themselves by means of retraining schemes, the unemployed, and now the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will remember those dawn raids on Yugoslav <span class="highlight">migrants</span>’ homes in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will always be large numbers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who do not yet have the vote and who are not yet citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would now like to speak briefly about some of the problems confronting many of the very substantial number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who live in the Perth electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know of the great contribution made by <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to both the economic and social development of this country, particularly in the postwar period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question is, however: Are we doing enough for our <span class="highlight">migrants</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have countless numbers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming into my electorate office pleading a case for the re-uniting of their families in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also welcome those aspects of the Governor-General’s Speech relating to immigrants as being essential to any successful and humane immigration program and I also urge the Government to give serious consideration to the suggestions in the Henderson report directed at eradicating some of the deficiencies and prejudices which our social welfare system presently contains regarding <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I look forward during my stay in this House to protecting and furthering the best interests of Australia’s <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no longer competent for us to say: ‘We are taking in all these <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not taking in the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shipping Company and the Orient Shipping Company both secured very lucrative contracts with the then coalition Government to transport <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither of those 2 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> brought a penny into this country- not a penny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were the sort of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> we need in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Committee has also seen the need on occasions to go outside its terms of reference and to look at the socially deprived, Aborigines and <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to see whether their background and the difficulties they face in a new community or a strange society prevent them from coping with the learning process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to clear up what is perhaps a misapprehension, I should point out that I did not make an announcement that we were attempting to lure more British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to reverse that attitude of thought amongst potential <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from the United Kingdom to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe an antiBritish feeling was developed and this was reflected in the attitude of potential <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from the United Kingdom to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to the House that a high proportion of our skilled <span class="highlight">migrants</span> come from the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the economic recovery gets under way in Australia we will be needing skilled <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from all over the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say to those who have seen this as a call for more British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> that this is not the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am seeking to do is to engender a positive attitude amongst potential <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from the United Kingdom to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our policies in this area of broadcasting are aimed at improving the information services to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as well as ensuring an equitable use of the radio frequency spectrum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How the tools of capital opposite can bear themselves in the knowledge that it is the pensioners, the Aborigines, the people in need of health care and pharmaceutical benefits, the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, those needing legal aid and others in depressed sectors who are affected by this program, is absolutely beyond me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Government in fact has made an announcement about its attitude towards potential <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from the Lebanon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One only has to consider that since 194S some 3.3 million <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have come to Australia and that one person in five in this country is a migrant to appreciate the impact of post-war immigration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we include the children born to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> after arrival, some 3.7 million of the total 6.2 million increase in Australia’s population since World War II is due directly to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a tribute to our massive development potential, the good sense of Australian-born people and <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in avoiding community tensions and the industry of our <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The constraints on our potential for population growth are not so much those of our natural resources as of the need to ensure a continuing improvement in living and working standards, the avoidance of short-term pressures on our infra-structures, the preservation of the environment, the avoidance of pockets of disadvantaged persons and groups, the need to ensure the retention of a cohesive Australian community with scope for cultural, ethnic and individual diversity and the availability of the sorts of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> the Australian community requires and wants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just over half of the unemployed are <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, with southern Europeans disproportionately represented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to that, more than half the men are <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and more than half of them still suffer from substantial language problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, in this Parliament I shall be taking a deep interest in all legislation which affects <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, who have made such a valuable contribution to the advancement of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing which this Government has established repeatedly is that it is a government intent on attacking the little people, the groups in our community least able to defend themselves- the pensioners, the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, the children in need of day care, those who need retraining opportunities and the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Think what this means to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who decide on their retirement to return to their homeland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I pay tribute to the locally engaged staff in Beirut who have endeavoured to maintain a service to potential <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and others applying to the temporary Embassy at very great personal risk to themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Extension of the eligible categories either of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> or visitors is not foreseen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are major problems of identification and extreme difficulties of obtaining necessary checks of potential immigrants including health checks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other day I pointed out an example of doublespeak on the part of the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  who, in a statement headed ‘Emergency Telephone Interpreter Services in Australia’, said that she was most anxious to examine ways and means of improving the efficiency of the service and client help for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently that was the way to improve the efficiency of the service and to help the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who needed that service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> who rang the service got a telephone number to ring the following day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> who come to this country from overseas and who bring with them their life savings to invest in the new country in which they will be dwelling, raising their families and contributing so well to our community, will have those life savings considered as part of this program and gain additional finance to establish their home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 3-year residential requirement excluded the most needy people and <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the statement the Minister says that 1.5 million persons in this country are <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When traditional British and Western European sources of immigration have declined Australia has had to recruit <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from countries or areas within countries- for example, rural Greece and Yugoslavia- without the background, education and industrialisation necessary to produce well-trained manpower. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not denying for one moment that there was little difference between a Labor government in the past and the present Government or little difference perhaps in the debate that ensued over the years over the source countries of our immigrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the 1950s and the beginning of the wave of southern European immigrationfirst it was the Italians and then later the Greeks- <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have disproportionately entered the unskilled and semi-skilled manufacturing and construction jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From 1947-34 80 per cent of the increase in the male workforce and 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the female workforce consisted of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only have <span class="highlight">migrants</span> accounted for the entire increase of members of the workforce from 10 to 29 years of age in the period from 1947-1961 but they have also to a considerable extent replaced Australian-born workers of these ages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus <span class="highlight">migrants</span> rather than school leavers to date have been the main source for replenishment of young workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to a study undertaken in September 1 975 by what was then called the Department of Labor and Immigration entitled ‘<span class="highlight">Migrants</span> in the Work Force’, the major occupation group in which <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are employed is the broad and statistically unsatisfactory group of ‘tradesman, production process workers, labourers, etc’ which together contain 45 per cent of migrant workers compared with 29 per cent of Australian born workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the people who have come to this country as <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have settled in an area of work in which, unless we do something about lifting their potential in the workforce, they are destined to remain, like a lot of the children who come from Greek families in my own electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that this is a tribute to our massive development potential and the good sense of Australian-born people and <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in avoiding community tensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are insufficient people teaching the English language to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that dispute <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were depicted as individuals who were taking action that was quite foreign to the Australian workforce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that we do not wish to have <span class="highlight">migrants</span> of any one national origin doing the most menial tasks that society has to offer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, our traditional sources of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have the same problem; that is, they are industrialised economies too and they are finding their fertility rates are declining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Society has to balance in its consideration of these matters the cost of migration to meet demands for goods and services such as schools, hospitals, roads and so on and the contribution which our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> make to industry and to investment flowing from the expansion of industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Society will therefore have to balance the question of whether we now require <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the short term in certain semi-skilled and unskilled areas and certain other skilled areas so that we can get the economy moving without their becoming factory fodder and without perpetuating the problems of factory fodder to which the honourable member for Melbourne rightly referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only then can we determine the desirable level of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and the sources of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whyalla has grown mainly on the basis of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who were brought to this country on the nomination of the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd to work in its shipyards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allied to this need to rethink our industry protection policies is the dangerous development here in Canberra, particularly in the bureaucracy, of the philosophy that our industries must be geared to the recent slow-down in population growth and intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> because that is going to be the permanent situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In migrant areas such as Earlwood, Arncliffe and Rockdale this is not the case because <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and other Australians are coming into the area with their, families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other area affected by the cutback was literature for prospective <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amongst the groups for whom the Australian Legal Aid Office assumed special responsibility <span class="highlight">migrants</span> figured prominently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Included in the charter of the Legal Aid offices was a special responsibility to protect <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are in many cases unfamiliar with our complex legal system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the area of pre-embarkation and shipboard instruction for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to this country a further cut of $30,000 occurs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time, through this body, ethnic groups were being investigated and plans were being drawn up for the purpose of protecting <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Medibank would not have become a poor man’s health fund for the infirm, the unemployed, the Aborigines and the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government proudly announces these savings on education, especially as they affect Aborigines and <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He should ask about the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and the children who are being taught in the schools in their own language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attention will continue to be given to the occupational qualifications of prospective <span class="highlight">migrants</span> so that newly arriving <span class="highlight">migrants</span> do not face the prospect of unemployment or take jobs which otherwise would be available to unemployed members of the existing workforce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To help offset the cost of the assisted passages, we have decided to increase the contributions from <span class="highlight">migrants</span> receiving assistance under the scheme by $50 to $200 in the case of single <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, and by $ 150 to $300 in the case of family units. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These include the children of widow and invalid pensioners, of workers close to the minimum wage or in intermittent employment, of self-employed people unable to earn an adequate income, and of many Aborigines, recently-arrived <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and other disadvantaged groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it also a fact that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are confused by proposals that Medibank is to end? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are concerned that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and people generally are being panicked into making such a rush for claims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we should do all we can to open our door to people who wish to migrate to Australia, but our intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> must be geared to the capacity of our society to absorb those people successfully. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister is attempting to create the impression that the new quota of 70 000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is based on a rational assessment of manpower needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the increased migrant intake there has been no corresponding increase in the provision for adult education in the English language to accommodate either those <span class="highlight">migrants</span> already here or those which will arrive in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no provision for expansion despite the fact that the Government has decided to increase the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figure of 20 000 more <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is one that the Minister has plucked out of thin air. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have never in the past exceeded the quota of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> eligible under the occupational skills criteria of the immigration program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are talking about- let us be honest about it- is increasing the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> under the family reunification program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to make only one last point about the Government’s immigration program and that is to draw attention to the impression that the new Minister has given that he is intent on returning to the traditional sources of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> for this country, in other words the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of its inquiries the Henderson Commission recognised that during their first 2 years in Australia many non-British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have to make large personal sacrifices in order to earn sufficient income to keep out of poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was revealed that some 12 per cent of non-British <span class="highlight">migrants</span>- that is 18 000 adult income units- had incomes below the poverty line after housing costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Often <span class="highlight">migrants</span> get poor jobs and are among the first to become unemployed during recession periods such as have been experienced in Australia over the past few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister seen reports that approximately 15 000 illegal <span class="highlight">migrants</span> entered Australia during those months when 8500 illegal <span class="highlight">migrants</span> surrendered under the amnesty arrangements? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, I would point out that every country has its quota of illegal <span class="highlight">migrants</span> at any one time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People over-stay or desert ships and there is always in any country a number of people in the category of illegal <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that if the honourable gentlemen opposite and their cohorts who are setting out to destroy this magnificent social advance, this terrific improvement on the shambles which they created, continue to create the sort of uncertainty, disturbance and unhappiness in the minds of people- particularly the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> whom they pushed into rushing into Medibank offices fearing that Medibank was being destroyed, because that is the nonsense coming from honourable members opposite- I believe that they will be doing a disservice not only to the great medical services that exist in Australia but also to the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not resolved the problems of suburbia nor the problems involved with the relationship of new <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in our communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does his Department currently accept Rhodesian <span class="highlight">migrants</span> if the applicants fall within the accepted occupational categories, or have reasonable compassionate grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-54-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without being pedantic about the terminology, I think the amendment I have foreshadowed ought to be considered seriously by the Government as the implications are very serious, not necessarily to citizens in general but to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems that what I and other honourable members on this side of the House have said on this subject has had some effect, because apparently the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has suddenly realised that this shabby treatment of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is likely to have serious electoral repercussions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally- this is not a terribly big issue at the present time but it was when the previous Government was in power and conditions were booming- it struck me always as ridiculous that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> must at least pretend that they intended to stay for ever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I regard his comments on the proposed numbers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to Australia this year as an insult to the migrant community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every Asian Australian will be aware of that policy, and I say to members of this Committee and to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> everywhere that that shows the real concern of the Labor Party for refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not want to stray too far from the subject, but it is pertinent to look at the Government’s record in the field of providing assistance to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> for integration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I accept what the honourable member for Deakin  (Mr Jarman)  had to say and I accept some of what the honourable member for Prospect had to say, namely, that these immigrants will not of themselves increase unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a tremendous resentment against the acceptance of the idea that somehow better <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will be those persons who have had an opportunity earlier on in life to work in the English language and to learn in the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But what he failed to say at the same time was that Opposition spokesmen, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and other spokesmen for the Labor Opposition would have us bring no <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet we find that last March Damascus was not notified in the Lebanon as a place where <span class="highlight">migrants</span> could be assisted, that the arrangements in Damascus were never stated to be temporary, that these arrangements were terminated with a minimum of notice, and that no permanent arrangements are contemplated in Damascus, despite the evidence that they would be in great demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the 1950s many honourable members had to show great patience and ingenuity to establish family relationships between prospective <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Italy and their sponsors in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first doctrine is that as one moves from north-west to south-east across Europe from the North Sea to the Mediterranean, so in Liberal eyes do the people become less agreeable and desirable as potential <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has approved an increase of approximately 20 000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to bring the total intake to 70 000 in the migration program for the 1976-77 financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This represents an increase of approximately 40 per cent in the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Figures which I received today from the Statistics Group of the Legislative Research Service of the Parliamentary Library show that in 1973-74 the total number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> was 112 712, in 1974-75 it was 89 147, a considerable reduction, and for the 9 months ended March 1976 it was 40 558. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important and interesting to find out where these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> come from. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 9 months ended March this year 13 823 of the total of 40 558 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were from the United Kingdom and Ireland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is unfair and unjust both to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and to Australians to bring out large numbers of people when unemployment is at such high levels after 3 years of Labor administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> will not be taking over positions which unemployed people could fill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span>, especially during the early period of settlement, add significantly to the demand for goods and services, thus helping to create employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government’s policy definitely ensures that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will not be permitted to settle in Australia if they face the prospect of unemployment or if they take up positions which could be filled by persons already in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An article headed ‘Plea Made For Skilled <span class="highlight">Migrants</span>’ states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia should start planning now for an increased intake of skilled <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Britain and Western Europe ‘, a leading employers spokesman said yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, we are in a splendid position to screen the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have been looked upon in the past, and still tend to be looked upon, as an easy supply of unskilled labour to occupy jobs which Australians will not readily accept in normal times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am concerned at reports- one on  Four Comers  last week- of the Australian population’s view of the standing of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that basically <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have not been given what I would consider is a fair deal in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>State departments tend to utilise teachers supplied for this purpose on the basis that if they have nothing else to do so they can teach <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Welfare among <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, which is a very important area and which requires attention even more now than it possibly did in the past, is neglected and, I am sorry to say, appears to be administered on the basis of political patronage at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I talk of the Italian organisation called FILEF (Federation of Italian Labourers, Emigrants and Families) which until this year had been serving a purpose which the present Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  said was valuable among Italian migrant workers in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Irrespective of his political leanings it is important that people who can communicate with <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and provide such a service stay in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That officer provided valuable service in Geelong where something like 25 per cent of the total population is made up of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the present immigration restrictions there are large numbers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have raised immigration queries relating directly to members of their families who may or may not, in the final analysis, qualify for entry to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However I understand that some advertisements for additional <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have been placed in England and this may tend to mislead people into thinking that we are increasing our migrant intake in a manner which is not intended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore he can only be arguing with that section of the immigration intake which is related to occupationally selected <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the occupationally selected <span class="highlight">migrants</span> we find that they are in categories for which there is a continuing and unfilled demand in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, it is my intention and the intention of my Department to provide intending <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with accurate, up-to-date, realistic appreciations of conditions in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not, as the honourable member for Prospect suggested, hypocritical to suggest that students from other countries who come to Australia should return home while <span class="highlight">migrants</span> should not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He also mentioned a publication called  <span class="highlight">Migrants</span> Melbourne  which I have seen, both in its original form and in the expanded form in which it has recently become available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should be pointed out that a number of governments do not allow advertising for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are seeking to do in regard to the present very low key and very minimally funded advertising campaign in the United Kingdom is to change an attitude rather than recruit <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are seeking to change an attitude brought about by the previous Australian Government’s attitude towards British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> which resulted in people in the United Kingdom feeling that they were not wanted in Australia any more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly for most <span class="highlight">migrants</span> the opportunities available to them were better than had been available to them previously and they made good use of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me, from my own inquiries, that in many instances a teacher coming out of a teachers college and who has more than one language- say a person of Greek background who has both Greek and English- is not likely to be posted to a school with a high concentration of Greek <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Population and Immigration Council survey showed that 66 per cent of Greek <span class="highlight">migrants</span> cited the English language as the biggest problem they faced; 55 per cent of Yugoslavs said that it was their biggest problem, whilst a recent survey of Italian <span class="highlight">migrants</span> claimed that it worried them also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one presupposes that in some way it is better it means that some people are entitled to first class legal aid because they come within a particular class of persons- they might be public servants, <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, pensioners and so on- and others get second class legal aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Furthermore, even if the reason for this policy stands up to scrutiny, it is my hope that all members of this House who have the welfare of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> at heart will demand that the state of affairs which necessitates this callous policy be rectified forthwith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet in many ways English <span class="highlight">migrants</span> face fewer problems than do people from other lands, and are better equipped to face the problems they do face, because they do not suffer the same language barriers nor the same cultural dislocations as confront non-English speaking <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>According to the very simple formula that has been put to us about the population of Australia, if we maintain the 1973 Australian fertility rate and if we are able to achieve a net gain of 50 000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> a year between now and the year 2000, we will reach a population of only 17.6 million, not the 21 million which may have been projected 10 or 20 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other difficulty we are going to run into, of course, is that we cannot fill the boats with <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as easily as we might have been able to do late in the 1940s, in the 1950s and the 1960s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That will present an enormous problem to governments of the future in Australia and I do not believe that we are going to be able to convince people in Europe, from where our traditional <span class="highlight">migrants</span> come, that it is a good thing to come here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In drawing up the recommendations for the 1977 expenditure provision was made for the continuation of special purpose programs such as those for handicapped children, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and disadvantaged schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is particularly so for Aboriginal people and <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We encourage <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to come out here and immediately set for them standards which are inferior in many respects to the standards we set for the community generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this is the case, will the Minister assure the House that, because of the apprehension that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia feel for the safety of their relatives in some areas and the humanitarian aspects of family reunions, the extended criteria will continue to operate in the future? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is significant that statistics compiled of people using the service who were interviewed show that 2 1.5 per cent of them were pensioners and 8 per cent were <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The limitations of the present scheme- that applicants must be married or widowed or divorced with dependent children and under the age of 36, that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> must have lived in Australia for 3 years; and that the value of the home must not exceed $22,500- have all been discarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that most States are using scales based upon the work of Broom, Jones and Zubrycki as a part of their procedures; it is my information that in all such instances other measures- such as the incidence of non-English speaking <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, student retention rates, truancy, pupil performance, for exampleare also used, and that local knowledge and common sense play a large part in the determination of which schools should participate in the Disadvantaged Schools Program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-43-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will be expected to provide a multi-lingual reference and information point for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, particularly in respect of services provided by Commonwealth, State and local government intrumentalities, and a range of resources which would be accessible to social workers and welfare officers working with <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, to ethnic community leaders, welfare administrators, teachers and students interested in migrant problems, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In its consideration of the likely impact upon Australia of an increased number of Lebanese <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, the Committee looked for any signs that the destructive factionalism of the Lebanon situation and the antagonism rampant in the Middle East generally were reflected to any extent in Australia- particularly in the media used by ethnic communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> took up residence in that area in good faith and I think everyone thought that opportunities did exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By far the largest element of the division is the Migrant Community Services Branch, which contains over 40 officers working in the specialised area of post-arrival services for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the recommendations of the staff utilisation review are followed, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will lose their most valuable channel to the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Such a course of action would serve further to confuse <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and the Public Service as to just who is responsible for ethnic affairs in this countrySocial Security or Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr Mackellar),  who represents the Minister for Social Security in this place, could enlighten us one of these days instead of leading <span class="highlight">migrants</span> up the garden path and placing them in a situation where they have to rely on a letterhead and four or five officers to look after their needs in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was to the effect that nobody would quibble about an Australian Government asserting its role and rights in regard to the housing needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, servicemen, ex-servicemen, persons living in the Territories, students, employees of the Australian Government or contractors to the Government and their employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over 3 million <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have settled in Australia over the past 30 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that we must all ensure that there are more courses and that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are motivated and encouraged to train and teach themselves to learn to read and write and understand English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can certify that <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, individually or as families create very much more electoral work than people who were born in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In regard to population shifts, the Borrie report, which was published recently, indicates a slowing down in our population growth, and therefore the number of electors, excluding <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, will be reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our complaint is based on the fact that during the last couple of years, when the conflict in the Lebanon has become worse, the Government at no time has given a clear indication of the guidelines for Lebanese <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we look at what happens after these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> come to Australia in fairly large numbers, into my electorate and into the electorate of Grayndler, we see heavy demands on the school system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thirdly, there is the fact that 3 members of the Commonwealth are a very large source of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> for Australia- Britain, as always, and since the war, Malta and Cyprus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Green Paper points out, in the past 10 years Australia lost a total of over 330 000 persons quite apart from the losses of former <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who left Australia to take up permanent residence overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of equal importance are issues such as the criteria upon which the intake is chosen, the distribution of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> throughout Australia, their qualifications and other characteristics as well as the countries from which they are drawn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instead of counting voters, Labor would have counted the youngest babies, it would have counted children, it would have counted visitors to the country, it would have counted unnaturalised <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and it would have counted aliens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people would suggest that in fact it is highly inflationary to bring more <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia: others would suggest that in fact what the economy needs is the stimulus provided by an increased migrant inflow, and I believe that that is what the honourable member is suggesting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has all but abandoned the growth centres at Bathurst and Albury-Wodonga, so one can only guess as to how these new <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will be accommodated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I must admit that in discussing this matter, I am referring principally to those <span class="highlight">migrants</span> of nonAngloSaxon origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the first article of the series it was mentioned that the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from continental Europe making up a significant proportion of our numbers are significantly and favourably influencing our cultural development but at the same time thenpresence creates social problems in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The article refers to the need for a spirit of partnership in the community between the new arrivals and those of us already here- the older Australians who have had the responsibility of making such an environment as we have- to be as helpful as we can to the new <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask honourable members to cast their minds to the citizenship ceremonies which they attend from time to time and at which masses of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> become new citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think we have failed in not making the effort then of trying to integrate and welcome those <span class="highlight">migrants</span> into our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a good term because many of us of Anglo-Saxon origin do not realise that many of these groups of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, such as the Greek <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, really come from a large number of different groups held together fairly loosely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am really quite honoured to follow in the debate the honourable member for Scullin  (Dr Jenkins)  who, in my view, gave a most reasoned discussion on the Green Paper, except that, unfortunately, he said that some people regarded <span class="highlight">migrants</span> brought to Australia after the war as factory fodder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the shadow Minister will well remember the work which was done by the Labor Party on the migration system in Australiathe work of rapidly cutting back the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, the work of dispersing the Department of Immigration and tying up some of its loose ends in a  pot-pourri  known as the Department of Labour and Immigration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The main thrust of my discussion would prefer to rest on the fact that the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to this country has been dramatically reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Paper suggests that there would have to be possible concessions to immigrants in order to encourage them not to go to the traditional stamping grounds of Sydney and Melbourne and the large cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Green Paper notes that the capital investment needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are quite different at times from those of the existing population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are other traditional arguments that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are highly motivated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that the needs of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the short term will add to the demands for goods and services, as I have said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasury would obviously realise that we would need a commensurate increase in the money supply to cope with the demand for credit that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> need when they come to this country, for instance, to purchase houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When considering migration we have to consider the approach of the government of the day which would be expecting to receive the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, and we must consider also the people seeking to come to this country as <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are looking for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as a basis of providing skilled trades I think we are deluding ourselves to some extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are looking to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as a stimulus to business, as business is suggesting- it may be effective but there are most likely less costly and more humane needs by which that stimulus could be added- I think we are deluding ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are merely looking for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> also because we feel there is something wrong with the numbers situation as it exists in Australia at the moment and we would like to have growth patterns because growth patterns are part of the conventional wisdom, I think we are deluding ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to seek additional <span class="highlight">migrants</span> I think we must be more prepared than we have been in the past to take the steps necessary to cope with the additional population we are seeking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the area into which <span class="highlight">migrants</span> traditionally have gone as workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, one of the major employers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in my electorate, the car industry, is static in growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Employment in the heavy industries which traditionally have been employers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, such as the steel industry, is in a serious decline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggestion that an intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will increase demand for resources is most likely true. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> will require accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at the moment the Government is demanding that the States spend less money and reduce their rates of expenditure, which does not seem to me to offer a great prospect for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> receiving the sorts of assistance which would be required if they are to be brought into Australia and accommodated as they are entitled to be if we are bringing them into the country for our benefit rather than for their benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>English <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are in an even more difficult situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>State Departments of Immigration go through some form of mystical process of screening <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After they have been screened and the sponsors in Australia feel that they have arrived at a situation where approval will be granted, they begin the process through which other <span class="highlight">migrants</span> go in the normal sense by being rescreened by the Commonwealth Department of Immigration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> would be expected to go into those areas and to build new houses further out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were successful because Australia needed workers, the jobs were available, the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were readily absorbed and they had nowhere else to go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-I am talking about nonEnglish speaking <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this instance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>English speaking <span class="highlight">migrants</span> start with some advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am speaking about nonEnglish speaking <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are an important source of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia and have provided a substantial proportion of the postwar immigration program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, because of the present difficult economic and employment situation in Australia, immigration programs have been decreased significantly to a point where the 52 748 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> arriving in 1975-76 represented the lowest intake since 1947 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1788 the population has been added to by immigrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today there are some 3.4 million Australians who are <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> make up approximately 30 per cent of the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report also states that the proportion of overseas-born long-term unemployed in the survey is roughly similar to that in the Australian population although it recognised that some <span class="highlight">migrants</span> do have special employment problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could look at the problems and the implications of unemployment for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, we have 3.4 million <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another point mentioned in the Green Paper is the traditional source of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not merely Australia’s decision that we will have a net increase in settlement of 20 000, 40 000, 60 000 or 100 000 and that these people will come from the same countries as our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> came from between 1945 and 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I hope that the Minister will be able to give us an insight into the departmental thinking about the traditional sources of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These figures include not only the settlers who are brought into Australia but also voluntary <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, those who go overseas, those who emigrate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is said- I think this is the grave error that was made by the Labor Party and accepted by this Governmentthat when there is unemployment the level of migration must be cut because the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will compete for jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are brought in it will add immediately to the labour force difficulties, but if <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are not brought in it will add to the labour force difficulties in the following year because there will be no markets, there will be a lack of growth in industry and there will be no employment available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this in the face of the undoubted fact that, over the very short term, the entrance of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> competing for jobs exacerbates the immediate unemployment position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have thought that at the present time we should be looking for our main source of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The crucial question for policy making is whether we accept that target figure and adjust our policies to it or whether we accept 16 million people as a base which can be increased quite substantially by a deliberate immigration policy of allowing in up to 20 million or even more new <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My remarks will no doubt raise the ire of some opposite and some who are listening to this debate, but I regard it as a matter of tragedy that, quite apart from those whom we are inviting to come to Australia as <span class="highlight">migrants</span> one in three or one in five, depending on what statistics one takes into account, of Australian pregnancies are terminated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But one out of 5 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to come to this country have left this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A net gain of 50 000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> per annum is within Australia’s capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is a trend to unemployment that results from world wide inflation, to be dogmatic about the level of intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> would represent a very absurd position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to look at the immigration intake and to see from where our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> came. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had 3.3 million <span class="highlight">migrants</span> over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was interested to read in the report that only 14 per cent of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> come from Asian countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, in cooperation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock),  should be giving much deeper thought to the need to lift from 14 per cent the intake of Asian <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and should have regard to the need to bring people from Oceania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first option is to the effect that there could be a gross intake of 30 000 to 50 000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a well substantiated contention that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> provide a net benefit in the overall scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government recognises the major contribution that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have made to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise this evening to point up once again the hypocrisy of the Government in the way in which it deals so blithely with migrant problems, particularly in some of the areas represented by honourable members on the Government side, who day after day pay lip service to what they say they do in the interests of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in their community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When there is a dearth of teachers this is an insult to the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and to the kiddies who go to Victorian schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we have the absurd situation of the Federal Government paying lip service, through the great harangues we heard tonight, to the population policy inquiry report while on the other hand there is a cut in Budget expenditure which has relegated the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are now here, and ignoring those who arrive in the near future, to second class citizens destined for the major part to spend the rest of their lives at the end of a pick and shovel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of these 3000 are under 2 1 years of age and some 30 per cent are <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This afternoon we heard a great deal of talk about the need to provide adequate care, attention and service for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But one thing that will certainly contribute to a solid foundation for any such policy is adequate care for the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are already in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it is revealed that 30 per cent of the 5656 unemployed in Wollongong are <span class="highlight">migrants</span> it will obviously give very grave cause for concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Wollongong has been ignored in the placement of these machines, it would be a continuation of this Government’s lack of interest in the problems of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have arrived in Australia and especially a lack of interest in the problems of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Wollongong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The neglect of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and the unemployed in the Wollongong region has gone on for far too long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A net gain of 50 000 people would involve an annual intake of 100 000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Whitlam Labor Government reduced the inflow of immigrants because it believed that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to this country would add to its economic problems by increasing unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, properly selected <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have a favourable impact on unemployment, and it was wrong for the Whitlam Government to have turned off the migration tap when Australia’s birth rate was falling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a moral obligation to take more <span class="highlight">migrants</span> into this vast, rich country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes)  may disagree with me, but then the Australian Labor Party has never been good to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this country since the days of Arthur Calwell who first introduced this scheme and who pursued it very well and to great lengths. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now the Labor Party is suddenly prepared, for political reasons, to cultivate the ethnic community in our country, but it is not prepared to bring any more <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we could readily absorb 100 000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the last few days we have heard honourable members in this place talking about <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greatest percentage of those people working in the Whyalla shipyards are <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is concerned about migration, and if the Government is concerned about the future of a main centre which employs a majority of migrant people, I am sure that it would try to do something for the industry to ensure that the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> about which it claims to be concerned, would find employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has failed completely to meet the needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> or of any other section of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  in stating a policy on immigration and population, is laying the groundwork for bringing more <span class="highlight">migrants</span> into this country, the Government cannot take adequate care of the people in the country at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is another matter whether it has any real regard for individual <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and for ethnic communities and the difficulties they face in an increasingly difficult Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that the Government would like to see, say, 70 000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> come to Australia each year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was largely based on the unacceptable principle of using <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as cheap labour in unsatisfactory working conditions for the purpose of improving the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those centres are supposed to provide all sorts of services to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, to assist social workers and welfare officers, and to draw attention to the particular problems of ethnic communities and individual <span class="highlight">migrants</span> requiring government action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is all very well as far as it goes and it would be praiseworthy if it were not just another token effort to distract attention from the fact that the Government is doing very little to meet the real needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has also transferred the office of Commissioner for Community Relations, which Labor set up, into the area of the Attorney-General’s Department where legalism is likely to become the order of the day rather than the compassionate, ombudsman type of operation which is necessary to deal with the real and continuing needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is there any precision in regard to what is needed to meet the fundamental needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, ethnic groups and many other groups of alienated Australian citizens? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problems of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> rest at the community level where there should be migrant resource centres spread plentifully through the urban concentrations of various migrant peoples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> rests at the community level, as I indicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any conscientious person who has worked among <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will tell you that the stresses common to all in our society are frequently aggravated because of the peculiar language and cultural differences of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They provide a far more difficult immigration problem than normal <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia come here either because they have families already here and as a result can integrate into the Australian community relatively easily, or have job qualifications that ensure that they will be readily employed and whereby able to sustain themselves in their new home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of them have lived a totally different life, particularly those from peasant farming communities and simply do not weld into the Australian environment the way the bulk of our normal <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have been able to do so successfully. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be arrogant and mistaken to devise policies for women in the way that special policies are needed, say for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> or Aborigines or pensioners or other deprived minorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the other areas of the Bill which seems to me to have a degree of unreality is that, it could be for instance, that the British Government would seek in Australia from British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are still British citizens recruits for the British armed forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the experience was that efforts to provide special benefits for low income earners and <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were a total failure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I bring to the attention of the House the urgent need for an examination of the circumstances under which Australian pensions are payable to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the over-generous conditions under which Australian pensions are paid to pensioners going abroad, the conclusion of these reciprocal arrangements is of far greater interest and importance to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> resident in Australia than to those who after a short stay here have left the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The manner in which general portability of Australian pensions was granted by the previous Labor Government is proving to have been most unfortunate for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who, though permanent residents of Australia, have not been here for 10 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> would have been better served if they had been given entitlement to pensions after, say, 3 years residence in Australia so long as they continue to live in this country and if portability of pension entitlement had been granted to those who leave Australia permanently only if they had spent considerably longer periods of their working lives in Australia than the 10 years residence which now applies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty found that there are some <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are unable to earn an income through employment and- to quote the Commission’s report- ‘who suffer lack of entitlement to age and invalid pensions in their early years of settlement’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All honourable members would be able to provide many illustrations of the type of hardship which these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> suffer, and there are some illustrations contained in the Commission ‘s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While aged relatives may not have contributed through taxes they are an important part of family and community life and the cost of supporting aged relatives of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is one which must be recognised and borne by the country inviting immigrant families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we need to change our approach to the provision of pensions to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The view that I have just expressed on the basis of the recommendations of the Poverty Commission was further supported in the paper by that Commission entitled  The Welfare of <span class="highlight">Migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result they could end up retiring in the country of their choice, being entitled to an income equivalent to the full pension paid in 4 different countries while in each of those countries there could be resident <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with insufficient incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can live on plain bread and butter and ordinary meat without the sorts of diets that one has learned to assimilate from our <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that during this period of rapid growth we have had lots of problems; for example, the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have been largely ignored, which is a rather sad thing, by all of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak with some feeling because my parents were <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inadequacy of our schools and the inadequacy of education for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have only recently been taken up by the Australian Labor Party, and the present Government is now pursuing them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the arguments put forward in this whole immigration argument is that we need the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> because that is the only way to get young people to help to support the old people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It implies that all old Australians are going to be literally old and on the scrapheap and are going to be kept by young <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that we cannot solve the population pressures of any other country by taking <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in large numbers- it would have to be very large numbers- from any one country that is suffering these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that we cannot just seek to push for our own development in this selfish fashion, recognising that we have a lot of unemployed that we cannot accommodate, that we have an increasing aged population, that somehow they will have to survive on social welfare and that we will have to maintain our own productive sections of the community by bringing in trained <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourthly, in addition to this loss, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> returning to their homelands have amounted to about 20 per cent of arrivals since 1925. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Green Paper points out that in the past 10 years Australia has lost over 330 000 persons, quite apart from the losses of former <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who left Australia to take up permanent residence overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said previously, in the short term we have problems with <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to this country because of our situation here, but in the long term we must program for many more <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to come here to help us develop this country and to hold it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be made clear to potential <span class="highlight">migrants</span> what the position is, what jobs are available, what the conditions are, how difficult it is to get suitable accommodation, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the question of the origin of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, I submit that many of those who claim that non-Europeans should be admitted are just as racially prejudiced as those they criticise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that ever since large scale immigration started its opponents have argued that in periods of full employment the cost of basic services required for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>- the so-called build-up of a social infrastructure- was so great as to use up our very limited resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told that we could not afford to let <span class="highlight">migrants</span> come into Australia because too many of our people were working just to provide the infrastructure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told also that Australia could not expand at the rate it ought to be able to expand because we were bringing in too many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and that the infrastructure cost and the labour cost were too great. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me summarise my position as far as <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think we should chase <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to come to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they are still prepared to come after seeing the unpleasant things, probably they would make better <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we close our minds and eyes to the problems of the pressing necessity of a large part of the undeveloped world- much of it a starving world- we will no doubt shelve our immigration problem with probably the excuse that because we have a high percentage of unemployed we cannot allow more <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to enter the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we must be aware of the large numbers of Australians who are opposed to recruitment of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to meet labour or skilled worker shortages in certain areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many workers see <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as a threat to job opportunities, either to themselves or to members of their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in conjunction with proper training schemes for our present Australian population, I believe that immigrants with special skills and employment prospects should be given special consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immigrants have tended to locate in the inner city areas of our larger cities, where amenities are already overstretched. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that special encouragement should be given to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to take up residence in country towns and the smaller capital cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should recognise the valuable contribution being made by <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia’s economic growth, prosperity and culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many of the source countries from which our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have come the family means not merely a dependent parent or a dependent child but brothers and sisters and their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way in which we can assist them in having family reunions as they understand them is to expand the migration program so that, in net terms, we are receiving something of the order of 50 000 to 70 000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span>-a total settler intake of 100 000 to 120 000 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the whole question of brother and sister nomination schemes should be reviewed and that ali ethnic communities should be allowed to nominate the same number in every 1000 of their population in this country to come out as <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am one who believes that, on balance, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> create employment not only for those <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who seek a job when they arrive here but also for unemployed settlers who are already in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly large fluctuations in the migration program are likely to cause a loss of confidence and a loss of employment opportunities, and to expand unemployment whereas a stable or an increasing migration program will have a stimulatory effect and will create more job opportunities than the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> themselves will seek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are all <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suburbs of Brunswick and Coburg, for which I became the representative in 1955, had a small proportion of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Schools had a handful of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet in that time I do not think anybody has come to my office or approached me personally and said: ‘When are you going to stop these <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming here?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have done pretty well in giving <span class="highlight">migrants</span> access to social security benefits, to some kinds of work and to schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A huge percentage of the residents of the Griffith electorate have come to this country as <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from many countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One view goes so far as to suggest that the situation of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in relation to education, health services etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The kind of services that are novel and which have been provided and about which politicians go around patting themselves on the back, are services we should have been providing for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this country for at least the last couple of decades. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In turn we will have those facilities there to receive from overseas large numbers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from non-English-speaking countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These kinds of facilities that we are building up will be built into the system to that extent and will be available for the assistance of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who come to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Green Paper also canvasses the source of our immigrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It makes the very fair point that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who come to this country and whose native tongue is not English occasionally find it more difficult to settle in Australia than those who speak English when they come here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot conclude my remarks in a debate such as this without once more being critical of what I believe are the back door efforts of the Government to give preference to the recruitment of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The State governments’ offices in London are undoubtedly being used as a back door way of bringing British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to this country in preference to persons from other countries who, I believe, have just as good a claim to come to Australia to make new lives for themselves and their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Subject to the above considerations, Rhodesians are eligible to enter Australia for settlement under the same conditions as are <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-83">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Is the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs aware that a large number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia of recent years have brothers, sisters and children over 18 years of age who wish to migrate to Australia, who would have guaranteed jobs in Australia, who are industrious and energetic but who are precluded from entry because of our present extremely tight migration quota? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He made the paltry statement- that is what it wasthat the present view of the Government is that its responsibilities to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> end at the aprons of the Tullamarine airport and of other airports in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am sure he knows that it is squarely based upon the acceptance of Australia as a multi-cultural society with all that that implies with respect to languages and cultures, the promotion of the teaching of languages of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, the acceptance of communication through their languages and the acceptance of the enrichment that can come to this country from the acceptance and recognition of their cultures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy will be guided by principles of humanity, equity and compassion and by the Australian people’s economic, social and cultural capacity to successfully accept and integrate <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In line with its determination to preserve a culturally diversified but socially cohesive society, the entry criteria for the selection of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will also embrace: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>A separate Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will also ensure the coordination of immigration policy with other major national objectives and provide a single focal point through which matters of interest to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> can be given prompt and effective attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition to this, a Liberal/National Country Party government will seek the cooperation of the States to establish bi and multi-lingual language and cultural courses in schools, particularly those with a high percentage of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In connection with the Liberal/National Country Party policy of encouraging <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to retain and share their own cultural heritage, a Liberal/National Country Party government will cooperate with the States to introduce appropriate ethnic sections into the Teacher Training Curricula. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To assist <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with their initial period of language understanding, a Liberal/National Country Party government will ensure that government information is available in a variety of languages, and will seek the assistance of the trade union movement and individual employers to make information and safety instructions available in migrant languages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take up the recommendation of the Committee that schools themselves should take the initiative in deciding to what extent and in what ways migrant languages and cultures should be studied, after consultation between school principals, teachers, parents and the community and apply it to my own electorate of Stirling in Western Australia, parts of which have a heavy concentration of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, particularly Italians and Yugoslavs, and some Greeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The vulgar jibe was made that the object of the Liberal Party- a Party whose philosophy is based on that of Greece and humanity- was to drop off the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> at Tullamarine airport or somewhere beyond Woop  WOOD or Wollongong and leave them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During discussion of an item dealing with ‘Methods Used in the States for consultation with the Ethnic Communities’, the New South Wales Minister,  Mr Jackson,  circulated to Ministers an extract from a High Court judgment that in regard to immigrants the Commonwealth had constitutional responsibility and power and that the States do not have it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was saying in effect that as <span class="highlight">migrants</span> become integrated in the community they become a fundamental part of the community in the State in which they live and cannot and should not and would not wish forever and for all things to be subjected to special Commonwealth legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe it involves discrimination in the sense that many companies, particularly those to which I shall refer shortly, who sell houses on terms contracts appear to sell primarily to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have made detailed inquiries into Compur Pty Ltd and its 4 associated companies- Pax and Co. Pty Ltd, Howey and Co. Pty Ltd, Brydale and Co. Pty Ltd and Aston and Co. Pty Ltd. From information I have obtained, I believe that group of companies is taking advantage of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who desperately want to purchase a home and do not fully understand the dangers associated with terms contracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it because <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are reliable people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it because the companies wish to help <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, or is it because they feel that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are easy prey? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the State Attorneys-General to take a very close look at terms contract sales with a view to outlawing them altogether or making changes that will give much greater protection to the purchaser and stop any unscrupulous vendor bleeding the sometimes unsuspecting purchasers, who in the main appear to be <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who reside in my electorate and, in the electorates of Grayndler, Phillip and Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall enumerate them again: Widows- and the Government is very good at bashing widows and the widows mite; it has a reputation for that not only in Australia but around the world- repatriation pensioners, <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, Aborigines and exmembers of the Defence force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This has been a totally cosmetic exercise to date, and in fact all sections that deliver post-settlement services to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia remain in the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister assure the House that these restrictions will be lifted immediately so that non-English speaking <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are guaranteed equality of access to medical, legal and social welfare services regardless of what language they speak? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is typical of the Government’s patronising view of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and their welfare that they will not be consulted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a means of providing refugees (and <span class="highlight">migrants</span>) with realistic opportunities for obtaining apprenticeships, appropriate employment, admission to tertiary and other educational institutions and opportunities for re-training, the Committee recommends that, irrespective of the current levels of proficiency, financial support be provided to all males and females of working age whilst they attend English language classes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is need for a comprehensive, balanced inquiry into Australia’s population resources and our need for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, not the inquiry which has been held or the political document which has been presented as a Green Paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is not to add weight or to give credence to the suggestion made by some that the Labor Party is part of a scheme to bring <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in merely to fill the gaps in some of the industries where Australians in future will not work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it true that the living allowance paid to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> while they learn English by the Migrant Education Branch of the Department of Education has not been increased for 12 months and that the single rate allowance of $36 a week is now $1 1.10 less than the equivalent unemployment benefit payment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My grievance concerns the Government’s failure to implement its promises with regard to migrant education and the admission by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  at question time yesterday that he had no interest or involvement in assisting <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to gain a proficiency in the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before the last election the coalition parties released an election manifesto entitled ‘Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Policy’ which stated that an understanding of the language, presumably English, was the most serious prob.em  to face many <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>However, the Government’s record in assisting <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to learn English over the last 18 months has proved how hollow this promise was, as with so many of the Government’s promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should have thought that the honourable member for Phillip  (Mr Birney),  who would have a number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in his electorate, would be voicing his opinion about the dispensing of social services to the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a series of speeches, television and radio appearances and newspaper articles the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  has vented his prejudice against British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who engage in trade union affairs by blaming them for the dire economic straits into which this country is steadily sinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, by calling for deportation or discriminatory treatment for British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> because of their participation in trade union affairs, the Minister not only offends the British born but all the nonBritish <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are made to realise that they are still regarded as different from Australian-born citizens by some people in power and therefore liable to be denounced or discriminated against. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I should like to make one thing perfectly clear to the Opposition, to listeners to the broadcast of these proceedings, to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this country and to the House: The Migration Act 1958 confers power for the deportation of persons who have not become Australian citizens in certain defined circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It must be obvious to everybody that with an influx of over three million people since the end of the Second World War some of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from various countries- not one particular country- will not fit into the Australian scene as well as the majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to pay tribute to the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from over one hundred different source countries throughout the world for the contribution they have made, are making and will continue to make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a fact that under its administration the numbers of British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to this country were overwhelmingly reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the first actions I took as the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs was to go to the United Kingdom in May last year, which was the first visit by a Minister of the Fraser Government to the United Kingdom, to reassure them that Australia did not- I emphasise these words- have an antipathy towards the British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> but that in fact we welcomed them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I repeat that it is hypocritical of the honourable member for Melbourne, the honourable member for Gellibrand  (Mr Willis)  and members of the Opposition generally to claim here, with their hearts on their sleeves, that they are defending the British <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their actions were significantly against British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to Australia during the time of their administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have had special Indo-Chinese refugees projects, special arrangements for the migration of Lebanese, amnesty for illegal <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, the abolition of re-entry visas, the establishment of an ethnic affairs branch, the establishment of the national accreditation authority for interpreters and translators, migrant resource centres, the establishment of the Australian Population and Immigration Council, the Australian Ethnic Affairs Council and the establishment of a permanent broadcasting authority which provides a special broadcasting service to cater for the rights of ethnic radio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the fact that the Government has spent considerable time and taxpayers’ money on the Coombs, Bland and Bailey reports, all of which directly relate to the availability of services to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and as the Prime Minister is about to announce, for blatant political purposes, yet another inquiry - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-0-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should have thought that any measures the Government might want to introduce or announce which would improve post-arrival services for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia would have had the support of the honourable gentleman if he were concerned with the real welfare of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-0-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In general a rapidly growing labour force tends to e more mobile because the new entrants, especially if they are <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, can be directed more readily towards the faster growing sectors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is anticipated that they will return to Yugoslavia and this terminology explains, firstly, why consular officials are not happy about such <span class="highlight">migrants</span> seeking only Australian citizenship, and, secondly, it provides such authorities with the authority they require to interfere with these citizens abroad, particularly those who do not follow the wishes of the Government of Yugoslavia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should bear in mind that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are coming mainly from the Lebanese and Asian areas and that textbooks are not printed in their languages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Above all, it took no account of the impact of economic decisions on the lives and well-being of human beings- the thousands of young people whose prospects in life have been blasted on the very threshold of their working lives, the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who came here for better opportunites and whose opportunities are being destroyed, the small businessmen being forced to close down, the families being deprived of a second or even first earned income, the people paying off a home mortgage or wanting to buy their own home, the Aborigines whose hopes for a decent place in their own country have yet again been deferred and denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nobody hearing or reading the Treasurer’s Budget Speech could realise that there has been a tremendous squeeze on the States and local government; that the Government has broken its promises on education spending; that spending on health programs is down; that the provision for pensioner dwellings is down by 18 per cent in real terms; that funds for Aboriginal advancement are down 16 per cent in real terms; that provision for urban public transport has been cut by 25 per cent in real terms and funds for leisure and recreation facilities by 60 per cent in real terms; that urban programs have virtually disappeared; that the national sewerage program has been abandoned; that all <span class="highlight">migrants</span>’ special serviceseducation, welfare, housing, health, languagehave been cut; that the growth centre agreements with the States have been unilaterally repudiated; that environment programs suffered cuts ranging from 24 per cent to 99 per cent in real terms; that the area improvement program has been abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, last year when the Ombudsman Bill first came on for debate in the Budget sittings the honourable member referred extensively to the power of deportation and to the rights of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> under the proposed legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, it has been the view of successive governments that it is not in the interests of Australia or of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia that political differences in their countries of origin should be pursued in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the postwar boom, they have been served by a Labor administration for only three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In almost every area of spending beneficial to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, allocations not only have failed to keep abreast of inflation but also have fallen behind their often inadequate 1976-77 figure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The overall reduction in real terms will adversely affect bilingual education course development which is so necesary if <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are to retain a proportion of their cultural heritage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This inquiry was established under the Labor Government when there was government concern about the plight, the needs, and the interests of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were a business grouping and not just a body of industrial cannon fodder in the eyes of those on the Government benches they would be receiving special grants in aid, special industry assistance, allowances, special capital improvement grants, all to ensure their economic survival at the taxpayers’ expense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In respect of housing and hire purchase the Commission of Inquiry said that the Government should set up a scheme to provide interest-free loans as settlement loans to unassisted <span class="highlight">migrants</span> for basic household purchases without the need for them to enter crippling hire purchase agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the reputation of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> standing high as good credit risks, a scheme of this kind would seem to create relatively few risks, and would have the added advantage for the migrant of enabling him to establish a good credit rating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It also made recommendations in regard to assisting an aged persons program within the ethnic communities; long term accommodation facilities for single <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with particular reference to single girls of all ages; power to local government authorities to control rent levels including amounts requested to be paid in advance as bond or rent; Federal and State housing departments ensuring an adequate supply of rental housing in cities like Melbourne and Sydney because of the desperate need of new <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and others; and a review of regulations covering Commonwealth hostels and flats to enable them to be used for accommodating <span class="highlight">migrants</span> encountering difficulties at any stage of their re-settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, the cruel restrictions on payments to the States for hospital and community health service development will deny <span class="highlight">migrants</span> equality of access to medical treatment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having done absolutely nothing for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the Budget the Government now intends, for Christ’s sake, to conduct an inquiry at taxpayers’ expense into the needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the fact that 806,000 Australians were unemployed for some period during 1976, despite the fact that the young are grossly over-represented in the ranks of the unemployed, despite the high rate of unemployment among <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and the outrageously high level of unemployment among Aboriginals, this Budget offers nothing to alleviate unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister explain why the May 1977 Labour Force Survey has found unemployment amongst <span class="highlight">migrants</span> arriving between January 1976 and May 1977 to be at a level of 15.4 per cent for males and 22.4 per cent for females? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was amazed to read a statement by the Leader of the Opposition, issued in Canberra I believe on Sunday, in which he drew attention to unemployment among <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the House and the people listening, particularly the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, that it was in the time of the Leader of the Opposition as Prime Minister that unemployment among <span class="highlight">migrants</span> nearly doubled; in fact, it rose by 90 per cent while the Labor Party was in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That should never be forgotten by people who claim that this Government is not concerned about <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and about providing opportunities for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of unemployment among <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, does he dispute the facts which were given on 23 August by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, in reply to a question asked by the honourable member for Hughes, that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who arrived between January 1976 and February 1977 amounted to 0.7 per cent of the work force but that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who arrived between those months represented 2.4 per cent of the unemployed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its report, the commission said it was determined to protect programs for disadvantaged schools and for special education including the teaching of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggestion that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are required to do the dirty work is also a myth, in my opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While on the subject of industrial disputes I must also decry the fact that so many British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> seem bent on importing the ‘British disease’ into the Australian trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is more violent complaint in the community today from workers and unionists, employers organisations, manufacturers, farmers, small business men, educationists, environmentalists, State governments, local governments, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and recipients of social security benefits than there ever was during the three years of Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some sections are more badly hitthe young, the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, the rural town dwellers -but no section can now feel absolutely secure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is important because it is now beginning to provide a service for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will want to bring in <span class="highlight">migrants</span> while young Australians are destined to be nothing more than carriers of water and hewers of wood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This area has the youngest population and the highest number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was the first comprehensive study of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>’ experiences in Australia and covered such areas as employment, accommodation, language and recognition of qualifications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to listing the major problems experienced by <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia, the report also identified the migrant groups most seriously affected by problems m these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when one examines the criteria under which <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will be accepted into this country, I think they leave a lot to be desired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One simply cannot consider merely the disadvantages experienced by <span class="highlight">migrants</span> or the children of migrant settlers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious from the report that such matters as the disadvantages caused to unskilled <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, particularly the recent settlers, have not been considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That being the case, the third point I make is related to the additional hospitalisation costs created by <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proportionately, the greatest burden of unemployment will be imposed on the young and on the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a decision that denies many handicapped persons, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and Aboriginals access to special reading and reference facilities that would ensure them some equality of opportunity- a decision that denies many Australians access to literature and information that would enrich their lives <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the matters that have made this revised approach necessary is the continuing falsehoods used by the Leader of the Opposition and other members of his Party who have suggested that programs of this Government on behalf of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> had been reduced, curtailed and cut. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, the Government should lose no further time in moving to implement the findings and recommendations of the Commission with respect to methods of reviewing decisions adversely affecting citizens or <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he had ever been on a car production line and received the paltry pay given to the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are brought into this country he would realise the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the figures have registered with the Government, but I think the Government simply does not care about <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> are aware that actions speak louder than words, and the only period of real action in migrant services was m the 1972-75 era of a compassionate government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The post-war immigration boom was begun under a Labor government but unfortunately for the thousands and thousands of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, services fell very quickly under a government that did nothing for them for 23 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> are in an unfortunate position when it comes to dealing with this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If big business faced problems comparative to those faced by <span class="highlight">migrants</span> this Government would pour millions of dollars into alleviating those problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are workers and are Labor voters at that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know who else is losing in this tug of war- the working class <span class="highlight">migrants</span> whose welfare has been long forgotten. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Trained people are being transferred to noncasework jobs, while many staff members who are meeting <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have no training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a reflection on the Government in reiterating its disregard for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> by placing their welfare in the hands of unqualified staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, the migrant services outreach program has been taken from a competent migrant welfare officer and placed in the hands of a woman with no casework or community work experience with <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This womanthe fault does not lie with her- has no linguistic skills, no experience of working directly or indirectly with <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and no direct knowledge of the politics and problems associated with ethnic community work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The ‘anything will do for the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>’ attitude of the Government again predominates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are totally disproportionate numbers in supervising, co-ordinating and planning compared with those providing a direct service to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The departmental machinery gives <span class="highlight">migrants</span> a feeling that there is a reduction in services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> need an easily identifiable and accessible focal point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She pointed out that the classes are invaluable to many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who cannot speak English at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What a disaster it will be for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in inner Melbourne if this established service is allowed to die. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This indicates the Government’s attitude to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Fraser Government’s reduction and deferment of services to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have stated a number of times that it was the previous Australian Labor Party Administration which demonstrated its total contempt for the wishes and desires of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> by splitting up the one department to which all <span class="highlight">migrants</span> automatically looked for help and assistance, downgraded it and amalgamated most of it with the Department of Labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He accused former LiberalNational Country Party governments of recruiting <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to work only in these situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member would know, a great number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are members of unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other and perhaps more serious thing that I would like to say about this statement that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are being used as industrial cannon fodder is that I wonder whether people who use that term, and particularly the honourable member for Melbourne, have taken the time to think about what they are saying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that when I say this I will not be misrepresented and that what I say will not be taken as demonstrating that I do not have any concern to ensure that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are treated fairly and equally with all other members of the Australian community or that I am not anxious to see everyone employed in as congenial a condition as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are heavily represented in employment in secondary industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do the honourable members and others who criticise this condition suggest that Australia should have refused entry to prospective <span class="highlight">migrants</span> likely to be employed in factories? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are they saying that the conditions and opportunities of those <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have found work in factories in Australia are inferior to the conditions and opportunities left behind? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in general it is a malicious gibe to describe Australia’s migrant intake as factory fodder because it gives a false representation of the factors underlying Australia’s admission of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have taken up employment in secondary industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More importantly, it is a slanderous attack on the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> concerned, many of whom have made successful and fulfilling careers in Australian industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This gives the he to those people who claim, on behalf of the Opposition, that somehow this Government has not lived up to its promises to assist <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are just some of the initiatives that this Government has taken in the field of assistance to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  began by telling us how he was delighted to see <span class="highlight">migrants</span> become wanted and valued members of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Minister has taken every step he possibly can to obstruct <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to this country becoming citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Even in his electorate broadcasts he talks about the hopes of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has no idea of what the needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> can perceive the situation for what it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any of us who have had dealings with non-English speaking persons in our community have had to deal with the bureaucracy and know how difficult the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>’ problems are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He will know that it is the traditional, establishment welfare organisations which have grabbed that money and which have not geared up in order to provide services to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs were concerned about these matters he would be concerned about <span class="highlight">migrants</span>- particularly women <span class="highlight">migrants</span>- who go to hospitals, who speak no English and who find no translators to translate their requirements to the staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thirdly, the Minister introduced a vast new range of practical services at the grass roots level which have been of very considerable benefit to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourthly, and more importantly, the Minister has allowed <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to see that this Government treats them with dignity, appeals to their intelligence and wants them to contribute to the future development of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Members of the Labor Party went around to meetings telling <span class="highlight">migrants</span> what they wanted to hear, talking down to them and treating them like fools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have been to many meetings where Labor spokesmen have stood up and told the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> insubstantial things just to gain popular acclaim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these different qualities are brought to this country by the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and will help us develop as a unique, democratic society based on the widest degree of understanding of our fellow man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are enabling <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to share in making the maximum contribution to the social, economic and political fabric of Australia and to help us solve the great challenges which face this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are the first government that has adopted this broad approach with regard to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We reject the spurious attitude of the Labor Partythe talking down to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We welcome <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the new and proper development of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the New South Wales Government sought to do was to claim that there had been some sort of cutback in funds for adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> are the most savagely affected group, apart from Aborigines, in Australia and are particularly affected by this unemployment crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the Minister could add was that it was not part of his portfolio so he could not be expected to answer questions and be questioned about an issue that is of vital concern to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be adopting the recommendations contained in the Bailey report, the report of the health and welfare task force and other reports which talk about cohesive services that need to be coordinated in the interests of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in general. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is leading <span class="highlight">migrants</span> up the garden path once again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in Melbourne have put it to me that they are concerned about the situation where <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What honourable members on this side of the chamber have constantly complained about is that there has been no effective improvement in the provision of services to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> under this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They continue to regard <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to this country as being children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They continue to regard the only fit topics for ethnic radio as being the soccer results from the countries of origin of our <span class="highlight">migrants</span> or news of ethnic carnivals at which there may have been folk dancing or something like that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is precisely because honourable members opposite regard <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as children that they will be rejected by them at the next election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know how many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> the honourable member has in his electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no publicity available in a language other than English to inform <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this country about the conditions of eligibility for citizenship and about the way in which they can go about applying for citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However I believe there is immense lack of dignity in the situation of half a million <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who live in this country without the vote because nobody has bothered to go and talk to them, to explain what their rights are and to help them take out citizenship if they decide they want to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that kind of outlet is denied to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this country it will be a very sorry day indeed and <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will certainly know who to blame. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Antony Whitlam)  finished his speech by talking about whom <span class="highlight">migrants</span> would have to blame. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite regrettable that the Australian Labor Party still insists on using <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as a political football for one side to blame the other for some matter or to seek to take some petty advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have a close family unit and, if the breadwinner is working, at least the family unit can be maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not refer only to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It relates to the question of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from West Germany who become naturalised in this country and then lose their entitlement under the German Government’s superannuation scheme, which is a contributory scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no room for paternalism in any of our migration policies and I hope that my colleagues, on both sides, will stop using the four letter word ‘them’ whenever <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are discussed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am the son of Scottish <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and, like the millions of other Australians who share my personal heritage of having been born overseas, would say: Let all members be aware that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> see themselves as <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overwhelmingly, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia quickly see themselves as Australians, and this is how we, as members of this Parliament, should always regard <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, no more and certainly no less than all Australianborn Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  who has sat through the whole of this debate, for his personal concern and involvement in the problems of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These guys work their hearts out for the welfare of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the honourable member for Hunter  (Mr James)  who is trying to interject has a concern for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Newcastle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a group, one could probably suggest that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> taken together, are the hardest hit group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But of the men, the major breadwinners in the family, the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are the least secure employees in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly in this situation, the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are in the least secure situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another reason for this occurring is because <span class="highlight">migrants</span> tend to be in certain industries which, certainly at this time, have been hardest hit- the textile industry, the clothing trade, the motor vehicle industry and even parts of heavy industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must accept the fact that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> probably are hardest hit in employment opportunities in a situation like the present situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, because the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> constitute the largest group in the sense that, in relation to the proportion of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the general community, the number of people needing these sorts of support services comprises a high proportion of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, so they are more dependent on services which ironically at this time are cut back and are least able to cater for the increasing demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So for all sorts of reasons, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in a sense are victimised by the difficulties of our economic downturn or recession- call it what you will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the discussion earlier today of a matter of public importance, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  gave some figures in respect of the various facets of services relating to and for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, last year’s figures represented a dramatic cutback in many cases on the amounts made available for these sorts of services for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> when the Australian <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For all these reasons, in my view, there has in fact been a real cutback in the allocation of funds for the sorts of services on which <span class="highlight">migrants</span> depend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I argue the case, or appear to be knocking immigration, let me assert the areas in which I am in favour of accepting <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourthly, the percentage of lost <span class="highlight">migrants</span> returning home to their original homelands has risen to about 20 per cent of arrivals since 1925. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The appropriations for the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs provide for a situation in which the intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will be rather static. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Green Paper presented earlier this year reported that Australia could take an increase of 100,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> do contribute to the economy, increasing purchasing power and trade generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the present intake rates it is expected that about 70,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will arrive m Australia during 1977-78. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note, too, that Great Britain is still providing the greatest number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to this country, followed this year by Lebanon, which country has had serious internal problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek leave to have incorporated in  Hansard  a table setting out the numbers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to this country in recent years and the countries from which they have come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> come to Australia to settle permanently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 6 August last the Minister stated that in 1975-76 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and former <span class="highlight">migrants</span> sent a total of $3 13m to all other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More importantly, in the same year <span class="highlight">migrants</span> transferred more than $3 50m into Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The table read as follows- situation improves in this country because <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have made a great contribution to our development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Paterson electorate, I have many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from all countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first concerns the provisions of services for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it is important that where <span class="highlight">migrants</span> themselves take initiatives in order to provide services which are required to the migrant communities on the basis of wishing <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are primarily of European origin and a substantial proportion of them are of East European origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, for too long <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were brought to Australia purely on the basis that when they leave the boat they cease to be anyone’s responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When they had been there long enough to learn that there were better jobs they left and another supply of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> was brought on the scene to fill their places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the plants have now learnt that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have had to stay in those jobs because there are no other jobs to go to; on the other hand, for the plants concerned there are no other suppliers of employees and they have had to raise the conditions of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This then will take away from the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in that area the only services which are really available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unemployment is also a greater problem for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> than it is for the majority of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put before the Minister the urgent need for the establishment of services for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the Geelong area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that currently there are 36,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the Geelong area and that ought to be enough to warrant the services of at least one officer of the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is especially the case with nonEuropean <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By that I mean <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from British Commonwealth countries who are entitled to place their names on the electoral rolls without the requirement of citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Corio mentioned the provision of services for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Geelong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the honourable member for Corio when he says that efforts by <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to assist themselves should be recognised and supported by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first one was to ensure that special purpose programs, such as those for handicapped children, <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, disadvantaged schools and country schools, many of which are extremely disadvantaged, were maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought to look closely at the oft repeated abuse of English <span class="highlight">migrants</span> by the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair),  who talks about the ‘Pommie shop stewards ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Broadly, the publications in the Department’s library cover the subjects of immigration, emigration, the education, health and welfare of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, automatic data processing and demography. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The programs for this sort of facility for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are left to State governments which show no initiatives and no ability to supply this multicultural diversity by providing adequate staff and facilities for these children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As immigration is a Federal responsibility, is it not also a Federal responsibility to provide adequate finance so that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> may be encouraged to learn English quickly? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Government realise that, without proficiency in English, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are condemned to low pay and menial tasks? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government provide funds now for the general expansion of this service, including provision of classes for shift workers and for unemployed <span class="highlight">migrants</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to the honourable member’s maiden question- I almost said maiden speech- yes, the Government is very much aware of the need for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to have an adequate knowledge of English as being a significant factor in their successful integration into the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Liberal-National Country Party Government will initiate a new deal for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further educational disadvantage is suffered by many other children, such as country students, Aborigines, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and girls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The eduation system has failed the migrant communities in two major areas- the maintenance of home culture through schooling and the achievement by <span class="highlight">migrants</span> of competence in the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular some of the factors which have influenced today’s decision include the increasing number of refugees entering Australia, the Government’s desire to improve access to language classes for migrant women, a general increase in demand for English language classes for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, and the commendable way in which some employers are encouraging their employees to develop faculty with the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also recognise the possibility that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who currently do not have full time employment may wish to take advantage of the opportunity to attend English language classes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The funds will also allow the development of a number of new projects and increased living allowances for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> taking full-time English courses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>New projects to benefit adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span> wil include full time English language courses in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth during the Christmas holiday period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The increased funds will also allow an increase in the number of English courses available to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the manufacturing sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government looks forward to the participation of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the detailed planning and management of the Christmas holiday courses and the establishment of committees in each State to help establish the courses in industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I point out in passing that these proposals reflect some of the preliminary suggestions of the group reviewing the Post-Arrival Programs and Services to <span class="highlight">Migrants</span> under the Chairmanship of  Mr F.E. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The current decision demonstrates the Government’s recognition of the importance of English language instruction in the successful integration of non-English-speaking <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any of us who represent <span class="highlight">migrants</span> know that they are swarming at our doors because there has been a reduction of facilities which they had last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real issue is this: If we are to help <span class="highlight">migrants</span>- this matter was raised with the Minister at Question Time today- it must be done on the basis of maintaining proper programs for early introduction to the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of us who have factories in our areas in which <span class="highlight">migrants</span> work know that the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are penalised because they have not the opportunity to communicate and have not the opportunity to advance themselves in their employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Child <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are entitled to as much consideration from the Minister as adults. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the Prime Minister who said: ‘A Liberal National Country Party Government will initiate a new deal for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> ‘; who said: ‘We will maintain present levels of assistance to Aborigines’; who said: ‘We shall ensure no person is denied legal aid because of lack of means’; and who said: ‘Only under a Liberal-National Country Party Government will there be a return to business confidence’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Khoury  is not alone in the treatment which he hands out to intending <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who come to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It charges $ 150-1 grant anyone that it is cheap by Khoury standards- plus $25 membership fee for doing absolutely nothing except exploiting would-be <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would enable the wholesale disfranchisement not only of Aborigines but also of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and indeed scores of thousands of handicapped Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has one of Australia ‘s greatest concentrations of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are interested in seeking a new identity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have been advised by you as Minister that they are eligible are unable to obtain their Australian citizenship for at least another six weeks, the excuse being that there are lengthy waiting periods for private citizenship ceremonies conducted by your Department? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771107_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do these long delays mean that many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will not be eligible to vote at the Federal election on 10 December because of the closing of the rolls on 10 November? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771107_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this action being deliberately taken by you as Minister to prevent eligible <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from voting at this election? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771107_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister also aware that because of staff ceilings imposed by the Government many Commonwealth electoral officers in Sydney are unable to advise <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Commonwealth countries of their obligation to be enrolled and to vote on 10 <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771107_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I again mention the fact that we are dealing with, for example, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and the problem of migrant education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771107_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a severe indictment of the Commonwealth Government which has a complete legal responsibility for all <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771107_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said this jokingly sometimes: If by some jest of nature the Australian continent were turned upside down overnight so that all of us were drowned, we would be the least missed country in the world and the greatest grievers would be Greece and Italy which have supplied our most recently arrived <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771107_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those 3 million <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia who were not born here have a special interest in the lowering of air fares. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are getting the same kind of second and third class treatment in this area of lower air fares as they are getting from the Government in other areas such as migrant education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But my greatest thrill has come from living and working with my constituents, most of whom are either veterans, young people, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> or, may I say elderly Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Agreement between Australia and Yugoslavia on the o Residence and Employment of Yugoslav citizens in Australia came into force on 20 May 1970 but has not been implemented because of procedural difficulties which arose subsequent to the signing of the Agreement Nevertheless, Yugoslav <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have the same opportunity as other <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to participate in English language courses and classes provided under the adult migrant and the multi-cultural education programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What steps have the Australian authorities taken under Article 11 of the Migration and Settlement Agreement between Australia and Malta, which entered into force on 1 July 1970, to promote facilities and establish classes to assist Maltese migants including their families to acquire knowledge of the English language and to facilitate the integration of the children of Maltese <span class="highlight">migrants</span> into the Australian education system and give them the opportunity of learning the Maltese language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>English classes are available for adult Maltese <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as part of the overall adult migrant education program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the ACT and Northern Territory advertising is also used to inform prospective students of courses at Technical and Further Education Institutions and to indicate the availability of course to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is possible that the net benefits of such immigration would outweigh the difficulties in employing <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Demographically though, I believe Tangney represents a microscopic picture of Australian urban society- old people and young families; all types of workers, be they unskilled or manual; professional people; academics; students and <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consequently <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming into Australia, who are especially selected to meet the skills that our society needs, could be the first step towards reducing our level of unemployment, ‘ he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wish to comment on a couple of points relating to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the Governor-General’s Speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before doing so, I clarify a misunderstanding that has arisen following comments made by me in the last few days concerning my attitude to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and immigration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the son of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> escaping from religious persecution and settling in Australia, I am all too sensitive to many of the less commendable aspects of Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I again witnessed intolerance, prejudice and lack of active support at government level for the establishment of services to help <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is on the subject of migration, excluding these two groups of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, that I have attempted to question assumptions and myths. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Close attention will be given to the recommendations of the expert group currently reviewing Post-Arrival Programs and Services to <span class="highlight">Migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is so, why has the Government changed the whole administrative arrangements for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> by once again concentrating all power in all areas of migrant welfare in the most centralised department of all, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advantages of administrative arrangements instituted by the Labor Government- advantages in the dispersal of welfare services, support for the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, health services, education and so on provided for all Australians, many of whom are <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, some of 50 years standing- now have been destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does that mean, in fact, that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will receive second rate inadequate service? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the advantages of our moves to decentralise this power, to take it out of Canberra, to get it into the local areas where the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> live, was that it allowed more direct community responsibility, particularly on the part of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it has done a lot for Australia and I hope that it has done something for the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For most of the years when most of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> came to this country a Liberal government was in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What did that government ever do for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the area of communication through the airwaves? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It allowed <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to say what they thought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just let them talk about the old folk songs and so on’- nice pap, uncontroversial mush- ‘Let the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> lull themselves to sleep with lullabies reminding them of the past in their countries, as long as it does not involve the realities of the past’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reality is that the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> themselves have become totally disillusioned by the way in which the Liberal Government has shackled their freedom of expression on ethnic radio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I only hope that some <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are aware of the fact that a Liberal member has said that, and they can make their own judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> rapidly fill job vacancies, thus getting production to increase quickly, so increasing supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no point in bringing in <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to increase supply when we cannot get rid of the present supply; there is no demand; and the Government cannot bring in enough <span class="highlight">migrants</span> quickly enough to increase demand, because that is not what they do: They have to earn a living first before thay can start buying the goods; they cannot earn a living if they cannot get jobs; and they cannot get jobs if no one wants to increase supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately, Australian Iron and Steel has followed a policy over the years of encouraging semi-literate <span class="highlight">migrants</span> into the work force because they accept very low wages and take the most menial jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Before dealing with the inadequacies of services for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, it would be as well to dispose of the suggestion that the level of unemployment amongst <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is not as high as that amongst Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a superficial examination of the Bureau’s table, to which I referred a moment ago, that would appear to be the case, when in fact the real fate of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is far less encouraging. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same table reveals more telling truths in terms of the fate of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who arrived in Australia before 1961, that is, 16 or more years ago, the unemployment rate was 3.2 per cent at May 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who arrived since January 1976 the unemployment rate was 1 5.4 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the dramatic increase in unemployment to a record level of 445,000 today, all of these figures must now be worse, with the anti-migrant bias making the relative position of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have been here for up to 15 years still more heartbreaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the current horrific rates of unemployment for all Australians, particularly <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, the Government goes on blindly insisting that the rate of immigration should be substantially increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Government insists on a large scale immigration program to meet the needs of industry, it does little to alleviate the continuing problems of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> after their arrival in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the study ‘A Decade of Migrant Settlement’ indicates that only 35 per cent of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have fluent or good English, and only 15 per cent of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Mediterranean countries, excluding the Middle East, have fluent or good English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can presume only that the Government, in its persistent drive to find skilled <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, is seeking white Anglo-Saxons proficient in those jobs where a fluent command of the English language would be mandatory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is not limiting its recruitment to those <span class="highlight">migrants</span> proficient in English, this would point to a desperate need for migrant education in full and part time English courses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were some token increases in living allowances for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> undertaking full time English courses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in 1976, no more than 5,000 students a year received any assistance in English under government programs in Victoria, despite an expected intake of 20,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the program was inadequate to cope with new arrivals, let alone the enormous backlog of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> already here hoping for help with their English studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The editorial of the  Age  of 18 January 1978 suggested just how hard a time <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are having in this current recession, particularly persons of non-English speaking origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their situation is exacerbated by the current economic recession because traditionally <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have worked in manufacturing industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These and other trends have made <span class="highlight">migrants</span> particularly vulnerable as they are the persons most readily affected by economic recession yet least able to defend their interests and rights at such times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The vulnerability of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> at a time of high unemployment highlights the inadequacies of current migrant services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How will <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who need such assistance to obtain benefits and allowances to which they are entitled fare now that the Department of Social Security is no longer responsible for providing these migrant services? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps ethnic radio could assist <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with information about their rights and entitlements and in finding jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Providing such assistance to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is at present discouraged by the tight bureaucratic and political controls which are being imposed on the ethnic radio stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hostile climate is effectively inhibiting the full use of ethnic radio as a community service to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> at a time when it could be vital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has shown little concern for the high rate of return home to their countries of origin among <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, particularly the professional and skilled- those groups which supposedly justify further increases in the rate of immigration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the huge number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> returning home indicates the blatant neglect by the Liberal Government of the continuing needs of our migrant families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not time we stopped using people as factory fodder, as tools of economic management, and developed a policy for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, not just an immigration policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This implies not just bringing in <span class="highlight">migrants</span> but the development of positive policies and services to deal with the problems and difficulties facing people who are coming or who have come to live in our multi-cultural society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proper interpreter facilities should be provided in all public hospitals dealing with <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, both for a physical and psychological illness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Policies for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> could include an expanded pre-employment introduction course for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> during which time they could be paid unemployment benefits without having to seek work while receiving English training and a general orientation for working and living in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> land at the dock or arrive at the airport and by and large they have to look after themselves, particularly in terms of the jobs they seek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many records of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> arriving in the country and seeking employment at the first factory which can give them work and putting up with conditions that they subsequently would refuse to put up with when they become more accustomed to the conditions in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole range of migrant services must be modified to ensure a humanitarian approach is taken to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and their problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the figures are a tribute to the resourcefulness of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in finding and keeping work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member drew attention to the fact that those <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, or overseas-born people, who have been in Australia for some time show a very much lower unemployment rate than do native-born Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Government has a strong record of support for migration and for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should never be forgotten that the Labor Party- the party that suggests that it has some special affinity with <span class="highlight">migrants</span>- when in government abolished the one department with which <span class="highlight">migrants</span> come into contact initially and which has a special relationship with <span class="highlight">migrants</span> following their movement to Australia and their subsequent settlement in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to migrant access to community services and social assistance programs, this Government has taken the initiative in developing the role of the ethnic media- a point mentioned by the honourable member- in informing non-English speaking <span class="highlight">migrants</span> of the services that are available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advertisements set out in some detail the services which are available to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> throughout the Australian community, and provide advice as to how <span class="highlight">migrants</span> can contact the relevant government departments which will assist them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that those centres- one of them associated with a community voluntary agency and the other totally staffed by government employees- represent a marked initiative in the provision of additional services to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, individually and in organisations, in the form of a contact and reference point with which people can develop some affinity and to which they can go for assistance and additional information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through the ethnic affairs branch of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, which as I have already mentioned this Government set up, we have brought together departments concerned with services to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since I became Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs I have had regular consultations with the appropriate State Ministers not only in respect of intakes but also in terms of services provided to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has provided a great number of other services to assist in the successful integration of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> into the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these, as in so many other instances, the present Government has demonstrated a continued and increasing concern to provide the sorts of services that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> themselves are seeking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the work force as a whole statistics show that <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, both men and women, are the first to be sacked in times of recession and suffer a higher rate of industrial accidents, mostly because of language difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, it is important for employment opportunities to be maintained for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with language problems, particularly for women <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, in industrial and light industrial work where this is not a handicap. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as qualifications for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to Australia are concerned, as I have explained to the House on previous occasions, the criteria used to establish entry eligibility are the same as those applied to people seeking entry to any of our training schemes under the National Employment and Training scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now this man has taken it upon himself, with a little community support, to try really to show to the Australian public what it was all about, and to bring to Australian young people in particular and <span class="highlight">migrants</span> a very worthwhile project which will present a magnificent spectacle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did he tell me on 22 September 1977  (Hansard,  page 1544) that Britain was the only country in which Australia advertised for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in 1976-77 because Britain was considered to offer the best prospects of attracting <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with readily recognised trade and professional skills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What will be the total expenditure on advertising for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in 1 977-78 in (a) Britain, and (b) other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has developed screening examinations in several professions to enable potential <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to demonstrate whether their professional competence is sufficient to enable them to obtain registration in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a particularly important initiative since prospective <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are able to ascertain the likelihood of registration in their profession while still overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-6">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As many skilled <span class="highlight">migrants</span> already in Australia for more than 6 months are unable to practise their skills because of language difficulties, how many of those <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who have arrived during 1977-78 have had similar difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-67">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The system of preparing a list of approved occupations in strong and continuing demand and of selecting <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with skills and experience in those occupations recognised in Australia is intended to ensure their placement in suitable employment on arrival in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-67">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think we must ensure that people who are aged, disabled, infirm, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and others who may not be fluent in English, people who live in remote areas and people who are uneducated are especially assisted in their participation in the electoral process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I represent an electorate with one of the largest concentrations of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia; we make an enormous effort to get through to them in their various languages the solution to the complexities of the Australian voting system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Another proposition I wish to put is that an expansive economic program should accompany any scheme that invites <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to come to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are skilled or unskilled, if there is a contracting demand for labour there will of necessity be a displacement of a migrant as an addition to the work force and an Australian as an addition to the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it makes good sense and it is necessary that the Government look not only at the need for interpreter and translation services for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> whose first language is not English, but also at the needs of Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition, the CES has the added responsibility of providing specialised advice and assistance to the particular groups in the labour market, such as Aboriginals, handicapped persons, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> et cetera, and more general occupational information and guidance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>European <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in our society have this strong motivation and we would do well to encourage it rather than tax it out of existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also understood that this policy would be accompanied by greater emphasis on the ‘occupational eligible category ‘ which would be more flexibly defined to avoid the restrictions currently imposed, which insist that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to Australia should be able to fit a category of employment listed by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations as occupations matching vacancies somewhere in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is, first and foremost, the issue of unemployment amongst Australian workers and recently arrived <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is some evidence to suggest that rates of unemployment among recently arrived <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are considerably higher, perhaps double that of the work force as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reality is that it will become increasingly difficult to attract skilled <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, given the economic situation in Australia and the morality of doing so from countries that are themselves short of skilled workers is questionable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fouthly, a recent article in the  Australian  of 2 May 1978 headed ‘Migrant shortage could doom North West Shelf suggested that industry groups, that is, mining companies and the Western Australian Government, want to import at least 30,000 more <span class="highlight">migrants</span> a year until 1980. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, does Australia have an obligation to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> already in Australia which it should be fulfilling rather than speaking in terms of expanded migration targets? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of these people must be recently arrived <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with limited skills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In looking at these groups, the Commonwealth Employment Service will have to be cognisant in a manner far more sophisticated than previously has been the case in Australia of the specific problems of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The statistics would show us that in manufacturing industry, for instance, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> comprise a far higher proportion of the work force than they do of the total work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the car industry, the shoe industry or the textile industry were being restructured, then, even in the sense of retraining the people involved, quite specific provision would have to be made for the problems of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that the local committees to be set up under clause 17 (2) of the Bill will contain a very good sprinkling of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> so that they can have their say about the functioning of the Commonwealth Employment Service offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs attempts to fill the vacancies with imported labour while those <span class="highlight">migrants</span> already in this country wait in vain for reunion with close relatives whose applications for migration have been knocked back by the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A great number of people- more than 300,000 people in any one year- in the world at present seek to come to Australia as <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and they go through the normal, proper channels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are naturalised Australians, or in some cases their children who are natural born Australians, may be regarded by their country of birth, or their parents birth, still to be citizens of those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This means that the Commonwealth Government’s outlays on housing, which include spending on defence service homes, housing for people in need, housing grants to the States, housing for Aboriginals and <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, as well as expenditure on urban renewal programs and growth centres, has been virtually cut to the bone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We established it in the light of our concern to ensure that the changing needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are being met as effectively as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We asked the Review to have regard to our federalism policy and our objective of supporting the enterprise and dedication of community groups who provide programs and services to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I said then, the Government is conscious of the special language, housing, employment and other difficulties faced by <span class="highlight">migrants</span> during the transition from one society to another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw the need to provide an opportunity for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> themselves to participate in identifying their problems and difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> and their children now make up about one-third of the total population of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Few Australians face the difficulties many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are confronted with particularly in the early years after their arrival. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally Australians have given a great deal of understanding and generous help to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Review has taken full account of all the problems <span class="highlight">migrants</span> face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has noted that notwithstanding these problems, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have struggled to maintain their cultural heritage and preserve their sense of cultural identity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding these efforts we recognise the special needs which <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, particularly the nonEnglish speaking and the more recently arrived, have in settling here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It agrees there is a need to change the direction of its services to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and that further steps to encourage multiculturalism are needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> should, in general, be met by programs and services available to the whole community, but special services and programs are necessary at present to ensure equality of access for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>services and programs should be designed and operated in full consultation with clients, and self-help should be encouraged as much as possible with a view to helping <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to become self-reliant quickly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It concluded that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who arrive with little or no understanding of English have the greatest difficulties and often remain at a disadvantage because of that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Difficulties were judged to be greatest immediately after arrival, particularly for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who come from countries without a long-established tradition of migration to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This group includes large numbers of those who are isolated at home- especially women- elderly <span class="highlight">migrants</span>- whose numbers are expected to increase dramatically in the course of the next decade- those from smaller ethnic groups- whose own support services are limited -migrant women at work and the children of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It points out that, since about 20 per cent of our community are currently ‘<span class="highlight">migrants</span>’, a similar proportion of the Commonwealth’s general expenditure on education, health, social security and welfare and other areas should be for the benefit of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It endorsed the view that services to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> should as far as possible be through general programs and, consistent with its terms of reference, the Review has not sought to assess the effectiveness of these general programs as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather, it has concentrated on establishing whether <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are placed at any disadvantage through ignorance of available services or through difficulties with access, communication and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will be aware of the current Commonwealth programs and services directed specifically to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, covering migrant education, migrant welfare, interpreting and translation and other programs and services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Review found that many of the problems encountered by <span class="highlight">migrants</span> arise from inadequate arrangements for their initial settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The program will be available to all <span class="highlight">migrants</span> either in residential hostels or by attendance at new community centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because <span class="highlight">migrants</span>* knowledge of the English language was found to be a critical factor in enabling successful settlement in Australia, special attention has been given to the teaching of English both to children and to adults. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there will also be a continuing need for special programs for certain groups and for the ‘backlog’ of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the community whose English is not adequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will also be provision for better education for teachers of adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, additional funds for training such teachers and for the provision of teaching materials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of this increasing emphasis on the teaching of English to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, there will always be a substantial number in the community who do not understand English, and who therefore face difficulties in communication. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will establish intensive English courses for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with overseas professional and sub-professional qualifications to help their work here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Review found that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are often placed at a disadvantage by their ignorance of their rights, entitlements and obligations in Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be an extensive survey of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>’ need for information, and its dissemination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with the recommendations of the Review, steps will be taken to improve the ways in which <span class="highlight">migrants</span> get information in areas of special need, including information relevant to employment, health, consumer protection, bail procedures, the Commonwealth Ombudsman and legal aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Review gave careful consideration to the best means of providing support for self-help activities by ethnic groups, and the place of voluntary agencies and the Good Neighbour Councils indelivering services to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They concluded that the ethnic communities themselves and the voluntary agencies can meet the welfare needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> more effectively than government agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Review concluded that because the needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have changed since the councils were established, and because it is not possible to revise the councils’ functions so that they do not duplicate or inhibit the role of the ethnic communities, there is no justification for continued Commonwealth Government funding of the councils. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will be taking action in the area of the law to protect <span class="highlight">migrants</span>’ rights in criminal investigations and in voting, and to improve information on such aspects as the legal system generally and family law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On income security, we will be giving high priority to resolving anomalies affecting <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, in the light of the problems outlined by the Review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, in accordance with the recommendation of the Review, trade unions will be eligible for special project grants to improve <span class="highlight">migrants</span>’ knowledge of and participation in union affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will also assist with development of more appropriate community child-care and preschool services for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Action will be taken to follow up the Review’s observation about handicapped <span class="highlight">migrants</span> experiencing problems of access to rehabilitation services, and that there should be greater use of ethnic workers in rehabilitation centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For older <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, we will follow up the suggestion that greater support be given to those willing to care for their elderly relatives at home, and that institutions accommodating old people should specialise more in providing an environment acceptable to ethnic groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as extending the ethnic radio service of the Special Broadcasting Service to all States, we will upgrade the Sydney and Melbourne services, and will provide funds to the National Ethnic Broadcasting Advisory Council to carry out research on <span class="highlight">migrants</span>’ views and expectations of ethnic radio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the Commonwealth level there will be greater co-ordination of the work of advisory bodies and a strengthening of policy planning and monitoring capability for all Commonwealth programs and services insofar as they are used by <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Review has pointed to increasing emphasis in State Government programs on meeting the needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, and to the growing awareness of cultural differences which has led to the development of State ethnic affairs units. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention in particular the  Chairman, Mr Frank  Galbally, for his personal commitment in preparing a report which is both sensitive to the needs and feelings of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and practical in its recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say that I believe this is the most thorough review of services to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> that this country has ever undertaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if it had been undertaken a considerable time ago the position of many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> would be much better than it is now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ) Preliminary figures for settler arrivals during the first seven months of 1977-78 indicate that 40.9 per cent of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were in the occupationally eligible category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other instances <span class="highlight">migrants</span> may arrange employment before arrival in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (5) It is administratively not possible to monitor the movement and employment history of all individual <span class="highlight">migrants</span> following arrival in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation of assisted <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Commonwealth Hostels admitted on the basis of occupational skills showed a total of 3 16 awaiting initial placement at 28 April 1 978, compared with 354 at 7 April 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many officers in his Department at (a) second division level, (b) class 1 1 level, and (c) class 6 level are first generation <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (b) The ‘planned’ component of the immigration intake is restricted to those <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who possess professional, technical or trade skills recognised in Australia and for whom it is considered there is a strong and continuing demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The criteria for the entry of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> being admitted on occupational grounds are based on labour market assessments prepared by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the new arrangements there will be important roles for all people within the community who have the welfare of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> at heart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in 1977-78, while 41 per cent of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were in the occupationally eligible category, less than one third of these were workers- 13 per cent of the total intake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The old approved list of occupations for the entry of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> compiled by the Department’ of Employment and Industrial Relations included occupations for which- let me quote the Minister- ‘there is some degree of unsatisfied need which may vary from time to time in a particular State’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the time lags involved, with immigrants on the way and therefore not counted- they do not arrive overnight, it might take six or nine months to organise for them to come- the result could well be an over-supply in some categories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, there is no direct relationship between the number of immigrants recruited and the number of known vacancies or vacancies likely to occur in the foreseeable future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no check to see whether the anticipated vacancies did occur or whether the skilled <span class="highlight">migrants</span> filled the vacancies for which they were theoretically recruited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in 1976-77 immigrants from Britain and Ireland formed 62.4 per cent of total departures, and those are countries from which Australia traditionally has obtained most of its skilled <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ideas are good but in actual financial terms, if my understanding of the promises of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  is correct, the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are going to receive less, not more, than they received this financial year, unless the Government changes the promise stated by the Prime Minister and incorporates a factor to take into account inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take it from the Minister’s interjection that that has been resolved and that the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will get some modest increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view, the increased selective program, the points system, will make it more difficult for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> already here to bring their own family members to join them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span>: problems of forms, confusion and communication. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What evidence is there of the multiplier effect being in operation in Australia due to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> breaking bottlenecks in employment opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say, because this is a cognate debate, that for the chronically ill, the poor in our community, the family man and his wife and children, the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and the Aboriginals that the changes being made by the Government to the system that has operated for the last 18 months or two years represents a retrograde step and will save only approximately 1.5 per cent of total medical costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It points to those who will be badly hit- <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, large families, Aborigines and the unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why, then, make life much harder for the unemployed, Aborigines, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and large families? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Government ‘s continued support for the education and welfare of Aborigines and <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is contributing significantly to combating learning difficulties within those groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-57-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nominations on behalf of, or applications from, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in occupations not on this list warranting special consideration are considered on a case-by-case basis by occupational review groups established in each State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-91-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has made much of its acceptance of the Galbally Review of Post- Arrival Programs and Services to <span class="highlight">Migrants</span> and the financial obligations that this entails. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Prime Minister presented the report and I was able to make some comments I made the observation that, if in fact the amounts recommended in the original review did not take inflation into account, it could well be that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> would be worse off rather than better off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a minor point but these small points were seized upon by the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as a great boost and I think that in that area it is not quite as it seems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In sum total, for that item in the Budget <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are down about $30,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has provided services for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and an enormous amount of material for the enlightenment of all of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, this cut, taking inflation into account, is a cut of over 40 per cent for one of the very few organisations providing real services to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and research information about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a time of general expenditure restraint we find that the Government is providing a wide range of new benefits and programs to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and migrant organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Labor Government came to office it did not even see fit to establish a separate department for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the present Government which saw the need to establish a separate Department of Immigration with which <span class="highlight">migrants</span> would establish contact initially and which would continue to provide a special contact point for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> during their subsequent settlement in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is always Labor spokesmen who state that the Government sees <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as being factory fodder’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, in other words, it was the Labor Party that saw <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as being manpower units and little more than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand this Government reintroduced the Department of Immigration and expanded it to include ethnic affairs, a recognition of the fact that the Government does not see <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as being just workers but rather as people with a unique and cultural heritage which we should encourage them to foster as they become Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has also sought to integrate migrant services in a way which will better enable <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to handle the Australian bureaucracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to rationalise this situation sensibly, the Government has assisted <span class="highlight">migrants</span> by adding settlement services, the telephone interpreter service, adult education services and other services within the one department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These represent a significant initiative in the provision of additional services to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, both individually and in organisations, in the form of a contact and reference point with which people can develop some affinity and to which they can go for assistance and additional information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the major achievement of this Government has been the establishment of the Galbally Committee and the subsequent adoption of its major recommendations regarding post-arrival programs and services for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there is a great deal of confusion amongst <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the use of that term and in understanding just how far the relationship extends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a bad idea to reflect on the amount of money that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> send overseas to support relatives in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this Government’s true attitude to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is illustrated by the discriminatory move of abolishing tax rebates for the maintenance of overseas dependents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This hits only immigrants and former immigrants and their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another question with regard to the admission of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is the possession of special professional or trade skills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not doubt the work done by the committee and I acknowledge the courtesy with which one is received when one makes an inquiry, but the fact is that when <span class="highlight">migrants</span> come to see a member of parliament and talk about one of their relatives whom they wish to see migrate to Australia and who they say has a particular skill in some area, they produce the certificates of that qualification or copies of them from some overseas school or institution and it is the devil’s own job to find out whether that qualification is accepted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a matter of common sense that we should perhaps have some consolidation in this area of professional and trade qualifications which would allow members of parliament and <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to identify clearly the acceptability or otherwise of their skills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So often those people who are refused a tourist visa have made an application some years previously to be <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia and either have been refused or have allowed the application to lapse when it has been accepted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any step that we could take to warn such <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are issued with these visas that the visas give them no right to work and no right to expect preference for permanent residence in the country has to be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things that is spoken about in this paper is the fact that at the bottom of the trade cycle when there is an excess capacity immigration in the first instance tends to use up only that excess capacity, so the increased demand from the new immigrants will not add so much to employment levels and, therefore, may add to unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we need to bear in mind, however, that the goods and services that are required immediately by <span class="highlight">migrants</span> tend to be goods and services in areas where there is not usually an excess capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The food industrythe essentials that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> require when they first arrive- is an industry which requires extra people for each extra cabbage or potato. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the Government that cut back the levels of immigration which made it so difficult for qualified brothers and sisters of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> already in Australia to enter this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think it would be fair to say that the previous Labor Government was an anti-immigrant party, despite the fact that the propaganda it has managed to create in some of the ethnic radio programs would appear to have convinced many immigrants that the Labor Party is on their side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the last year instead of about 20,000 new <span class="highlight">migrants</span> net there were over 60,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is quite wrong for the honourable member for EdenMonaro  (Mr Sainsbury)  to suggest that there was anything about the Labor Party when it was in office or in Opposition which could possibly suggest that the Labor Party was against immigration or that it was against <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that one ought to recognise that for 23 years there was a Liberal Party government in this country which certainly did not talk about multi-culturalism, which certainly did not introduce programs on migrant education, which certainly did not support centres like the Ecumenical Migration Centre or the <span class="highlight">Migrants</span> Clearing House and which left voluntary agencies with limited resources to fight alone in the whole field of migration welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One cannot look at a policy in relation to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in separation from the policies which, for example, a government adopts in relation to the management of the economy and the management of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The direct effect of immigration for two decades (that is, excluding the inflows from Australian born children of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>) was to contribute at least 40 per cent of the annual increase in the Australian labour force: Indeed in the 1950s the contribution would have been in excess of 50 per cent per year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was the suggestion in the Minister’s statement earlier this year that the gross intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> for 1977-78 could be only 77,000, less 7,000 leaving the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat: Eighteen per cent of recently arrived <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These appropriations show in human terms our preparedness to accept, to educate and to assimilate <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, wherever they may come from, and also to take our share of responsibilities for refugees, particularly those from South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our choice of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> must reflect people possessed of the work ethic, people who are prepared to adopt our country, to focus on opportunities, and to work to fulfil ambitions born out pf the opportunities they see. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The decision to cut oneself off from a way of life and to adopt another is a heartbreaking one for the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who make it, and in those circumstances assimilation is most important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All I can say to the honourable member for Batman is that he seemed to be a little confused in relation, firstly, to the history of migrant education and, secondly, to the contribution that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> make towards the economic well-being of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, the Government has made a conscious decision in relation to these two categories of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> which states that the humanitarian and international obligations override the purely economic considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to those <span class="highlight">migrants</span> selected on an occupational basis, surveys both in Australia and overseas have shown quite conclusively that the recruitment and employment of one skilled person can lead to the additional employment of up to four or five semi-skilled or unskilled people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This measure, which is in line with the views expressed in the report of the review of post-arrival programs and services to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, was made necessary by the mounting abuse of the existing provisions with substantial costs to revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable members, the new direct billing arrangements could include persons in the following categories: persons on low income including social security unemployment, sickness or special beneficiaries; newly arrived <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and some other ethnic groups; refugees who are financially disadvantaged; persons who suffer financial misfortune because of substantial medical expenses caused by prolonged or severe illness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An examination of the table shows that less than two per cent of Asian settlers and less than 33 per cent of Greek and Italian <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were assisted while more than 80 per cent of northern or western Europeans coming to this country were assisted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some 26,000 elderly new Australians from countries other than Britain or New Zealand are excluded from receiving an age pension on residence grounds, but this exclusion has no effect on 15,500 elderly <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from the two countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is particularly noticeable to someone who works in an electorate in which there is a heavy concentration of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, particularly southern Europeans and more recently Latin Americans, and sees how they are treated in terms of our social security policy in comparison with Anglo-Saxon <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The need for the hostel to be used results from the Government’s decision to accept 9,000 IndoChinese refugees in 1978-79 in addition to other assisted passage <span class="highlight">migrants</span> which will require additional hostel accommodation to that already in use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One other factor that should be mentioned is that in an area where there are going to be an additional 960 to 1,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> there will obviously be a lot more children and those children are going to have to go to local schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we have been talking about and what we have been trying to suggest is that the people in the electorate of Batman, a large number of whom have low incomes, a considerable number of whom are social service beneficiaries and many of whom are <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with families that are divided between Australia and countries thousands of miles away, are not now to receive, under the terms of this Budget, the treatment which was promised by this Government prior to the election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is likely that the <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, the Aborigines and the large families who are unaware of the possibility of finding a doctor who will bulk bill them will be deterred from seeking early treatment and thus will need hospital treatment later on, at even greater expense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  says that the bulk billing arrangements for disadvantaged persons could include persons in such categories as the unemployed, people receiving sickness benefits, <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, some ethnic groups, perhaps refugees and people suffering from prolonged or severe illness, but there is no compulsion on the doctor or specialist to agree to bulk billing these categories or any other person for that matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The statement that with a gross intake of approximately 77,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> Australia would finish up with a net migrant increase of approximately 70,000 was based not only on people applying overseas for migration and being granted entry to Australia but also on those acquiring change of status in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He then goes on to state that the profession should not be allowed to fall to the literacy level of its clients and that, in particular, if we are to admit into the profession Aborigines and <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, there will be a need for an elaborate course of indoctrination of those persons before they will be properly able to put into practice the ethics of the profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is saying that we do not have Aborigines and <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in any great numbers in the law now and yet the law is struggling ineffectually against the evils of a type of morality in our society brought forth by some classes of big business and by some classes of trade unionists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the problem is already with us, then it is with us not because of Aborigines and <span class="highlight">migrants</span> but because of pre-existing difficulties in our society arising from improper behaviour among various people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a matter for the Public Service Board to determine, but one of the matters being considered in the development of the scheme is the role of Departments and Authorities on employers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, what steps will be taken to ensure the availability of, to quote from the report of the Galbally Review of Post-Arrival Programs and Services to <span class="highlight">Migrants</span>, ‘adequate interpreting and translating services’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>From time to time we will hear people associated with the immigration policies of this country and some industry leaders saying that we need more skilled tradesmen; that the only way we will get skilled tradesmen is to have a greater inflow of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are a number of related social problems which could tear this nation apart, particularly the widening gap between the information rich and the information poor in which the unskilled become an intellectual proletariat; the problem we have to face where shorter working hours are offered with correspondingly lower pay which means, in effect, increased hardship for the poor; and growing competition for jobs which will disadvantage young people, women and <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The same report also provides comparative data from Western European countries, the United States of America, South Africa and the Arab region of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in order to show how recently arrived <span class="highlight">migrants</span> fulfil functions in those countries which are similar to those they fulfil in Australia, namely, to carry out the dirtiest, most difficult, most unpleasant jobs which are denned widely by the respective societies as being socially undesirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Given this analysis and the fact that non-English speaking <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are increasingly doing such socially undesirable jobs in Australia- that is, those jobs marked by low social status in one or more of the following traits: Work which is heavy, dirty, dangerous, monotonous, relatively poorly paid, and which has irregular working hours- I argue that it is increasingly important, in developing policies concerning the safety and health of workers, that this fact be made most explicit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Migrants</span> would appreciate more than anybody else the need for regular scheduled services to other countries of origin rather than the uncertainty of a one class charter operation when they are faced with the need for a quick visit home or a visit to Australia by a relative or friend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While this and other research studies do not provide a complete answer as to the numbers involved, it is clear that the problem of illiteracy is a real one for some Australians and, in particular, for Aboriginals and <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from nonEnglish speaking countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-58-124">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Difficulties in making independent checks of the correctness of claims for those allowances were recognised in the Report of the review of post-arrival programs and services to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>- the Galbally Report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-56-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, as the Galbally Report on Migrant Services and Programs states, ‘the present provisions enabling <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to send money out of Australia are generous by international standards and are generally adequate to meet any family obligations a migrant in Australia may feel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-56-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In implementing the Galbally Report on Post-Arrival Services and Programs for <span class="highlight">Migrants</span>, the Government is committed to improving information services to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to enable them to take their place in society, partake of its benefits, exercise their rights and discharge their duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-57-89">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To name but a few the Government has introduced tax indexation, export incentives, family allowances, automatic indexation of pensions, abolition of estate and gift duties, lowering of Division 7 taxation on private companies, a major improvement in the facilities for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and improved social welfare services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that 77 per cent of Greek <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in the last year were approved on a family reunion basis compared to 31.6 per cent for Italian <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, 15 per cent for South African <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, 24 per cent for Rhodesian <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and a higher level of 64 per cent for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from Turkey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ramifications of this situation should, I believe, require the Government to reconsider urgently its decision on the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to be accepted into this country each year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First it is not correct to say that there has been a 10 per cent increase in the number of illegal immigrants entering Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the point that most illegal <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia have entered the country perfectly legally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some have deserted ships, for sure, but most of the people who are prohibited <span class="highlight">migrants</span> entered the country perfectly legally and have broken the conditions of their entry to Australia by overstaying their visas, by taking employment or by attending educational institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out also that the problem of illegal <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and of prohibited <span class="highlight">migrants</span> is not confined solely to Australia and that every country has within its borders at any one time a significant number of people who are there illegally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The current impetus towards greater tourism has real ramifications in terms of the potential for building up the number of overstayed visitors and the number of illegal <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Overall, the problem of illegal <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in Australia is one which has been with us and will remain with us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The objectives and targets arising from the Galbally report and accepted by the Government have meant a strengthening and refocusing of the English language education program for adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and refugees as well as a substantial increase in activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But my hunch, based on discussion with members of the ethnic communities and so on, is that six weeks is not an adequate time for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to become skilled enough in the English language for the purposes for which the Government wants to give them training, namely, to ensure they can better fit into jobs and that they can find their way around and have better access to their rights as members of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I concede the point that what I am about to say is possibly covered in other facets of the Budget proposals but I want to make the point, because I think it is significant, that this funding will not be sufficient to ensure that the children of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, whether born overseas or here, who wish to retain some association with the culture of their parents and to retain facility in the language of their parents will be able to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a sense one could argue that in giving special training to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to ensure that they speak English adequately and maintain their own mother tongue and in ignoring the Anglo-Saxon student one is making the Anglo-Saxon student a deprived person because he is finishing up with a facility in only one language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even now, one of the greatest problems that we have is that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who were welcomed into the Australian work force, who have made a substantial contribution to Australia by working in our industries and developing production and who wish elderly relatives to join them, are going to be faced with relatively massive charges to bring them to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Well, there are a lot of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> around the countryside who need interpreters and a lot of Aboriginals dispersed all over the countryside, particularly in the northern regions, who need health interpreters and translators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> often do not know their rights and they will not come forward, so these people have to seek them out-  to encourage them to use the health resources available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bearing in mind that proportionate to immigrants’ representations in the community, there are many more immigrants or children of immigrants who are unemployed and untrained than there are other members of the community, ordinary Australians, in a sense this cut will hit immigrants and their families more than the rest of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the Government’s concern to ensure that the changing needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are met as effectively as possible within the limits of available resources, it decided late in 1977 to commission a review of post-arrival programs and services for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> under the chairmanship of  Mr F.

    <p>Two years ago, there was virtually no initial settlement program for newly-arrived <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the current financial year provision is made for almost 12,000 newly-arrived <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to participate in this program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is for a substantial proportion of adult <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who do not speak English and require information about Australia, its institutions and available services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An additional $lm has been allocated for the development of migrant resource centres to assist community settlement and to provide focal points in the community for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to receive information and advice on services and to develop their own co-operative arrangements for self-help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe also that we must link the immigration intake with effective post-arrival settlement programs so that the process of immigration is one that is satisfying and productive to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> themselves and to the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be possible to turn off the flow of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, but it is hard to turn it on again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He and the government of the day recognised how much migration had been associated with buoyant national prosperity and how it was impossible to turn the flow of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> on and off without, firstly, a loss of confidence in Australia as a country of resettlement and, secondly, a consequent loss of impetus in planned population growth as an important component in economic development and national prosperity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is by no means impossible that within three or four years of the introduction of an open-ended policy for brothers and sisters as many as 100,000 brothers and sisters would be coming to Australia as <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, very few <span class="highlight">migrants</span> chosen under NUMAS had arrived before the beginning of this financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government has been accused more recently of promoting migration ‘at a time when unemployment amongst newly-arrived <span class="highlight">migrants</span> has reached 17.5 per cent’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not reflect the very high level of mobility among recently arrived <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who might have had four or five jobs in a relatively short period but be unemployed at the survey date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently arrived <span class="highlight">migrants</span> move from hostels into the community or from initial accommodation to more permanent accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to realise also that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are highly mobile in the period soon after their arrival in Australia, so that they are able to take up vacancies in the Australian work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also refer to a document dealing with news reports of relevance to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> which was produced by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was simply this, that if one is arguing for an ethnic radio media service which has no political content at all in the sense that issues are not argued out- in other words, if what one is looking for, as is said by the Galbally report, is merely a kind of ‘minestrone’ of very safe items, a bit of travelogue here and a bit of folk singing there, but where one does not engage in any serious discussion of the actual issues and the political context in which <span class="highlight">migrants</span> live- one creates a situation which is ‘politically safe’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- I take pleasure in reporting on the implementation of the Galbally Report on Post-Arrival Programs and Services to <span class="highlight">Migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The theme of the Galbally report is the need to overcome the disadvantage <span class="highlight">migrants</span> experience when they are newly arrived or when, as has been allowed to happen over the past 30 years, they have accumulated a backlog of unmet needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ethnic liaison officers working at senior levels within all Commonwealth departments and most statutory bodies continue to raise awareness of the special needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, refugees, and ethnic groups, thereby influencing the planning of programs and services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither of those figures represents the full extent of the Commonwealth commitment to the welfare of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the report stressed that as far as possible the needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>- some 20 per cent of the population- should be met by general programs directed at the whole community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The program is constructing a new vehicle taking new routes in the delivery of programs and services to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At every point in the implementation program the special needs of migrant women are being taken into account, although it is not always easy to determine the extent to which migrant women are disadvantaged as <span class="highlight">migrants</span> or disadvantaged as women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The survey of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>’ information needs will reflect the views of women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allowing that some of the 57 recommendations overlap, it is still possible to sort them into three compartments with connecting doors: First, those covering initial settlement, meeting the immediate needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> on arrival; second, those providing what might be called back-up services, helping newcomers towards full participation in the Australian community; third, those recognising the cultural diversity which characterises Australia today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these centres are being run by community groups in which <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, including migrant women, are represented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government and non-government agencies alike will be reappraising their services in the light of results from the extensive survey into the information needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and the channels through which they communicate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through a switching system linking rural areas with capital city services backed by locally engaged panels of interpreters and translators, it will be possible to cover significant concentrations of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> outside major centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Resulting from discussions with <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, ethnic and other organisations and State and Territory administrations, we have made adjustments to the program, following in this the advice tendered in the Galbally report itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Along with its medical research activities, the newlyestablished Migrant Health Unit within the Commonwealth Department of Health, with the co-operation of health authorities in the States and Territories, is building up a comprehensive picture of health information currently available to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> so that the gaps can be plugged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not neglecting the needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in rural areas which, whilst perhaps different in degree, may be no less pressing than the needs of individuals in greater concentrations of population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, ethnic liaison officers have been appointed at senior levels to try to raise an awareness in government departments of the special needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, refugees and ethnic groups generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can only say that, judging from the reactions of many <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, these workers- I am not criticising their efforts- have a long way to go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This represents a very meagre increase in expenditure on <span class="highlight">migrants</span> by the Government compared with the funds provided already under initiatives of the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Realising that, however, really it is not such a great increase in expenditure, particularly when one bears in mind that as a condition of the Government’s accepting this proposal it withdrew the right of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to claim as tax deductions the funds that they send overseas to maintain their dependants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reality is that as a result of that move <span class="highlight">migrants</span> as a group will lose $20m in the first year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the coming year there will be expenditure of $ 15m but, given the fact that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are losing the sum that I have mentioned- $20m- that is a profit to the Government of $5m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Galbally report mentions the needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and the relevant part of the Minister’s statement reads: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report itself stressed that as far as possible the needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>- some 20 per cent of the population- should be met by general programs directed at the whole community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We tried to ensure that services for <span class="highlight">migrants</span> would be available within the service departments and that there would be sections within the departments of Social Security, Health and Education to deal with the needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An enormous proportion of this funding is really for the emergency services necessary to cater for these refugees, who will prove to be far more expensive than the usual run of immigrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again, and taking that factor into account, we find that the expenditure on services for the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> that we expect to arrive is far less than it ought to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told that the program is constructing a new vehicle to take new routes in the delivery of programs and services to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and that structural changes involve a network of community-based settlement councils, settlement committees, settlement centres and migrant resource centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, of course, again given that we have had this problem- that is how we have looked at it- of immigrants to this country for many more years than the last two or three and even longer than the three years that the Labor Government was in power, far too little has been done and far too little is being done at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, half the people who come to the country as <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, in my view, I would have thought that is totally inadequate in view of the numbers of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There must be at least 20,000 adults who would like to have tuition in English, but we have provided for a magnificent total of 8,000 unless, of course, the effect of the Numerical Multifactor Assessment System is to ensure that mainly English speaking <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are selected to come to the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even 1 1,000 this year is a long way from what I think the figure probably ought to be unless, as I say, we have managed with NUMAS to tip the balance so that most of the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming here now speak English which is possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is going to make it more difficult for non-English speaking <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to get here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we come to the 48 special project grants, which were offered to encourage self help among ethnic groups and to help trade unions in providing welfare services to <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, with a total expenditure of $ 1 50,000, this sounds good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told that an extensive survey is being undertaken into the information needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and the channels through which they communicate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without a doubt I am sure that it will puncture many of the preconceived notions about the information needs of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not surprising that there are many complaints from <span class="highlight">migrants</span> about the inadequacy of this service, both in terms of numbers and in terms of the quality of the people employed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Which government reduced the residence qualification period from 20 years to 10 years to help <span class="highlight">migrants</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 ) When tabling the report of the Review of Post- Arrival Programs and Services to <span class="highlight">Migrants</span> on 30 May 1978 (Hansard, page 2730), the Prime Minister said that the Government’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) The Department of Health is not responsible for any programs and policies in regard to prospective <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However it does medically examine <span class="highlight">migrants</span> and reports on whether they can satisfy the medical standards for entry to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of post-arrival services for <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, the Department is responsible for implementing two recommendations of the Galbally Report viz: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main element of the discussion focussed on what the ASEAN nations deemed to be the problem of illegal <span class="highlight">migrants</span> entering their countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I refer the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to an explanation he gave on 30 August this year in which he said that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to Australia fell into four categories- family reunion, refugees, those entering by virtue of the Tasman agreement and persons who were selected because of their occupational skills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the high unemployment level amongst recently arrived <span class="highlight">migrants</span>, will the Minister confirm that, under the Numerical Multifactor Assessment System selection process, persons who fall into this last migrant category are still being selected primarily because of labour market demand for their skills? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is continuing; but, under the NUMAS scheme, there is flexibility which allows the entry to Australia of people who score particularly well under the NUMAS selection system; those are outstanding <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who may have occupations which are outside those classified in the information given to my Department by other Commonwealth departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are seeking to do is to have a selection system which brings to Australia <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are most capable of settling in successfully and playing a real role in the development of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, I am fearful that this English language testing may tend to make it rather more difficult for nonEnglish speaking people, particularly those with a southern European background, to qualify to come to Australia as <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taken together, these charges imposed on visitors and would-be visitors to Australia and on temporary residents in the country will recoup more than the funds provided for the migrant communities via Galbally expenditure when one takes into account the disallowance as an income tax deduction of funds sent overseas to dependants of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It involved alleged discrimination against British <span class="highlight">migrants</span> by the same man and the same union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly, I indicated at that time that many <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are naturalised Australians, or in some cases their children who are natural born Australians, may be regarded by their countries of birth, or of their parents’ birth, still to be citizens of those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is one of those countries, but the major countries from which we obtain <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are not parties to the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This decision not only discriminates against resident <span class="highlight">migrants</span> seeking to bring additional family members to Australia, but ensures that many people approved under NUMAS for settlement in Australia as independent <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will be pushed to the end of the ever growing dole queues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the system which operated prior to the introduction of NUMAS settlement of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> classified in the labour market category was only allowed where the potential migrant’s occupation was in demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These statements mean that the Minister is prepared to play politics with the lives of 87,000 <span class="highlight">migrants</span> this financial year by pretending that independent <span class="highlight">migrants</span> selected under NUMAS will easily find jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that large numbers of independent <span class="highlight">migrants</span> will enter Australia during 1979-80 with jobs skills already oversupplied in a domestically saturated employment market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than admit this, the Minister has made a series of statements which are not true to avoid the allegations that NUMAS undermines the labour market prospects of Australian residents and potential <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidence in our possession shows that NUMAS is biased in favour of rich, white English-speaking middle class immigrants from Rhodesia and the USA, while at the same time significantly weakening the family reunion aspect of the immigration program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>NUMAS is designed and operated to select <span class="highlight">migrants</span> on the basis of their settlement potential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia is made up of four broad categories, namely, refugees, family reunion cases, the free flow from New Zealand and the admission of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with skills currently in short supply or with proved entrepreneurial capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are worried about the possibilities of unemployment amongst <span class="highlight">migrants</span> it is strange that the Labor Party has a policy which would create further difficulties for people coming here and attempting to find jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this category we have the largest entry of semi-skilled and unskilled <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no assessment of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> from across the Tasman- New Zealand citizens- under the arrangements presently in place, which have been in place for a number of years and which were kept in place by the previous Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the largest intakes of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> into Australia, yet it does not come under NUMAS. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is just another demonstration of the sheer incompetence and lack of understanding of the honourable member for Port Adelaide in relation to the total intake of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> into this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last broad category of entry into Australia applies to those independent <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with skills currently in short supply or with proved entrepreneurial capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am supposed to have misled the Parliament by saying that occupational demands or the skills possessed by independent <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is absolute nonsense and entirely misleading to tell this House that skills possessed by <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are not taken into account when they make an application under the independent applicants category to come to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simplistic suggestion has been made that there is unacceptably high unemployment and, therefore, we should cut down on the number of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> coming to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been demonstrated time and time again that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are more geographically mobile within any one nation than are the people who are born and settled in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The document from which I have quoted, which is available, spells out the mish mash of incompetent strategies that the Government has perpetrated upon the Australian work force, including <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that until 1 January immigration policy covered these categories: Family reunion, special family reunion, refugees, persons freely granted residence because of the Tasman agreement, and the general eligibility provision wherein independent new <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were selected mainly by relating their skills to the Australian 1 mainly abour market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last category involved approximately 44 per cent of <span class="highlight">migrants</span> before NUMAS commenced on 1 January this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are seeking to do is to have a selection system which brings to Australia <span class="highlight">migrants</span> who are most capable of settling in successfully and playing a real role in the development of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has there been any improvement in matching <span class="highlight">migrants</span> with jobs under the NUMAS system? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is by no means impossible that within three years of the introduction of an open door policy for brothers and sisters, as many as 100,000 brothers and sisters would be coming to Australia as <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regardless of the numbers, it is significant that most nominations for brothers and sisters would be for persons from countries which have not been our traditional source of <span class="highlight">migrants</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is particularly important when the independent <span class="highlight">migrants</span> are accepted on the basis that they will not be competing against other Australians for certain skilled employment when they enter Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one carefully analyses what happened at the time that the Government accepted that report, it is quite clear that whilst the Government offered $50m over a period of three years- a few million dollars in the first year, a few million dollars more in the second year and the bulk of the money in the third year- at the same time that the Government gave with one hand it withdrew with the other hand the allowance which until then <span class="highlight">migrants</span> had been able to claim for income tax purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In real terms, as far as the migrant community is concerned, the money which <span class="highlight">migrants</span> lost in the denial of that allowance for income tax purposes more than paid for the funds to be allocated under the Galbally report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the very first year of that disallowance, <span class="highlight">migrants</span> lost $20m but the amount of money allocated by the Government for migrant services in that first year was about $7m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the second year- this financial year- the sum allocated has been less than $ 1 6m, but again the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have lost over $20m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the amount that they lose will go up because <span class="highlight">migrants</span>’ incomes will go up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have paid well and truly for the services’ given to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the older workers and not the younger workers; it is the recently arrived <span class="highlight">migrants</span>; and it is the Aboriginal people in the farflung and outlying communities of this nation who are bearing the weight and full dint of this Government’s repressive economic policies which have introduced into this nation the most extended recession it has experienced at any time since the 1930s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one thing to say that we are 10,000 tradesmen short a year in our training programs and that we are going to aim at bringing in 50,000 skilled <span class="highlight">migrants</span> between 1979 and 1985; but Australia should be applying a lot more time and a lot more of its vast resources to determining which skills those 10,000 people a year should have and what we are going to require after 1985, not only in the manufacturing industry but in the services industry or in academia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other areas we have been able to prove- I ask honourable members opposite to look at the  Hansard  for Estimates Committee B- the enormous conflict between the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs about the criteria being used for allowing <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to come into this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the other three items mentioned, approximately 75 per cent of the costs in the current financial year can be attributed to caring for refugees, and the remaining 25 per cent to caring for sponsored <span class="highlight">migrants</span> selected under NUMAS. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-47-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the early days when <span class="highlight">migrants</span> were often referred to as ‘reffos’ it was felt that the term ‘new Australians’ was a more appropriate term to use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some people refer to <span class="highlight">migrants</span> now as ‘ethnics’ and in some circles that also is greeted with horror. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fifteen or twenty years ago we tended to take the attitude that all <span class="highlight">migrants</span> to Australia ought to become just like us and and should learn to like the footie, the beer, the meat pie, et cetera. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All of us speak at citizenship ceremonies and make mention of the fact that <span class="highlight">migrants</span> have come to enrich our lives, that some of our own traditional behaviour patterns have become subjective and that the finer qualities often tend to emerge dominative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
