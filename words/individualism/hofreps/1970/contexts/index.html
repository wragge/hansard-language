<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We must use the wealth of <span class="highlight">individualism</span> and initiative by providing incentives and guidance to cut inefficiencies and the impersonality of centralised planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The individual has rights, and in a world increasingly indifferent to liberty and <span class="highlight">individualism</span>, a man’s remaining rights must be respected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe in <span class="highlight">individualism</span> - in citizens being able to show kindness and to give humanitarian assistance to these, elderly people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a philosophy of a simple, rural <span class="highlight">individualism</span>, before the onset of the industrial revolution of the first half of 19th century Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it was the fervent hope of  Sir Robert  Menzies that aid to independent schools would further the cause of <span class="highlight">individualism</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The selfish <span class="highlight">individualism</span> of the post-war years has been replaced by a more confident <span class="highlight">individualism</span> based on mutual concern for others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This profoundly democratic principle has given the British people inspiration, <span class="highlight">individualism</span> and direction for over 600 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now the Leader of the Opposition has talked at the weekend in his conference about ‘vibrant <span class="highlight">individualism</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said before, the Leader of the Opposition talked about ‘vibrant <span class="highlight">individualism</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a lot of <span class="highlight">individualism</span> available to the poor children in schools, for instance, in my electorate, who never had the chance of tertiary education and never had anything more than an intermediate certificate standard or school certificate standard of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was no talk about thenindividualism or their opportunity- the so-called <span class="highlight">individualism</span> of the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their <span class="highlight">individualism</span> was a case of: ‘You are on your own, mate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its <span class="highlight">individualism</span> will stress not survival of the fittest, but concern for the value of each person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Individualism</span> and individual initiative are very much an Australian trait. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will strive against these divisions and I will strive for the <span class="highlight">individualism</span> of diversity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not believe that they wish to forfeit their <span class="highlight">individualism</span> to an all-pervading, paternalistic government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This spirit of enterprise and <span class="highlight">individualism</span> does offer the best opportunity to the individual to be master of his own destiny and to reap the reward of achievement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I consider the depths of compassion and unselfishness of which this man was capable I appreciate more than ever the superiority of the co-operative values which inspire the Australian Labor Party over the morally barren <span class="highlight">individualism</span> which is preached from the other side of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means <span class="highlight">individualism</span>, liberty, equality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He refers to the way that manufacturing industry is trying to go and believes that there will be a rush back to <span class="highlight">individualism</span> in manufacturing that will step over worker participation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A more significant factor is the desperate adherence of the Government to a now completely outmoded form of economic management based on pre- World War II notions of  laissez-faire  capitalism, to which has now been added the weird beliefs of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  in economic <span class="highlight">individualism</span> as expounded by the American novelist Ayn Rand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every country has people of differing combinations of logic, rational thought, <span class="highlight">individualism</span>, moral precepts, intuition, feelings, group responsibility and aesthetics to shape their intellectual processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
