<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How many are <span class="highlight">boat people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the reports from Vietnam of further boat loads of refugees being anticipated, can the Minister guarantee that Australian immigration procedures and policies will be sufficient to cope with these <span class="highlight">boat people</span> as the trickle becomes a flood? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many <span class="highlight">boat people</span> from Indo-China: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States has announced that it is preparing to accept another 25,000 refugees and a number of those will be people who have come to be known as <span class="highlight">boat people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The closer that Australians live to the point of entry to Australia of Vietnamese <span class="highlight">boat people</span>, as they are described, the greater is the concern of those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This news was received and welcomed in that area and particularly in Vietnam as evidenced by the ever increasing flow of <span class="highlight">boat people</span> who are now arriving on our shores. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia security, Australian jobs and to an extent Australian drug risks are as great and as important as health problems in respect of the exotic and other diseases associated with the <span class="highlight">boat people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our defence surveillance should be brought to a level to enable the <span class="highlight">boat people</span> to be intercepted and accompanied to such a base. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More recently, Australia has made substantial contributions to UNCHR’s Special Program for Indo-Chinese refugees in Thailand and other countries in Asia, including the <span class="highlight">boat people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-3-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This figure includes 1016 <span class="highlight">boat people</span> who have arrived here without prior authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-11-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the exception of the 1016 <span class="highlight">boat people</span>, who have still to have their status determined, all of the abovementioned arrivals were given migrant entry visas and have permanent resident status in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780523_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-11-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister for Health seen a report that at least half of all adult Vietnamese arriving in Darwin have traces of tuberculosis, a highly infectious disease which had virtually been arrested in Australia before the influx of the <span class="highlight">boat people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is particularly so in the case of those people known as the ‘ <span class="highlight">boat people</span> ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A small number of Vietnamese <span class="highlight">boat people</span> made landfall without escort or entry permits but were quickly apprehended and then processed in a similar manner to the others I have described. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have recognised that, when <span class="highlight">boat people</span> arrive, the options open to this country are limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This kind of comment of course is more particularly directed at the ‘<span class="highlight">boat people</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of that total intake, only just over 2,000 are <span class="highlight">boat people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the publicity given to the <span class="highlight">boat people</span> arriving this year, their total number amounts to no more than one week’s intake of refugees through normal channels as part of the Government’s official refugee program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is an indictment of conditions in Vietnam that some <span class="highlight">boat people</span> who have been placed in gaol in Darwin because there is some doubt about their refugee status have written to friends in Vietnam telling them how much better conditions are in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy of the Australian Government has been to put the greatest priority on giving help to the <span class="highlight">boat people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst we are not neglecting our responsibility of taking refugees who have gone to Thailand, I believe that there is a need to try to help the <span class="highlight">boat people</span> who, if they do not get some sort of help at an intermediate stage, might try to make the long trip to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We witnessed first-hand several of the terribly compact refugee camps in countries that had received the <span class="highlight">boat people</span> and in Thailand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In being willing to accept these <span class="highlight">boat people</span> we are conceding that at least 50 per cent of them are dying during the journey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
