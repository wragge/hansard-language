<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We regard this provision as such a serious curtailment of the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the subject that we believe that if there is to be such an offence it should be an indictable offence because, in our view, the safeguard of a jury trial is required in these circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of speaking for all honourable senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government maintain a conscious policy of balancing the traffic between the two operators or are public servants at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to make their own choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to answer that question at this moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any farmer who has already made arrangements with a private bank for loan purposes will be at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to continue with those arrangements and, if he so desires, to avail himself of the rural (finances available through the Commonwealth Development Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the differences between countries, however the balance between authority and <span class="highlight">liberty</span> is resolved in these different countries, the free peoples- those who seek to elevate the dignity of man, to laud him for what he is and for what he is able to achieve- will reflect, I believe, the measure of their own value of freedom by the consistency with which they defend freedom in their own countries and likewise challenge those who would deny freedom to other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That whereas our constitutional parliamentary democracy was clearly developed as a Federation to preserve for all time to the Australian people their cherished right to live as free men and women, enjoying complete <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of worship, assembly, speech, movement and the communication of knowledge and information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Standing Order 407a provides that, in the debate on the Address-in Reply, or on the First Reading of a Bill which the Senate may not amend, or in moving the Second Reading of a Bill, a  Senator shall  be at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to speak for one hour and a half. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I accept the fact that the Opposition naturally is at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to bring this matter on again one day next week or at some time in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I regard details of the proposals made to me by  Mr Stone  as confidential and do not feel at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to reveal these to the honourable senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 regard details of the proposals made to me by  Mr Stone  as confidential and do not feel at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to reveal these to the honourable senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We therefore beg you to give immediate consideration to granting permanent residency to any Thai national now in Australia who cannot return to Thailand for fear of life or <span class="highlight">liberty</span>, and to ensure the security and well-being of all Thais in this country, irrespective of their political beliefs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We further request that the Australian Government grant refuge to Thai students and others who are forced to flee from Thailand in fear of their lives and <span class="highlight">liberty</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator McLaren,  I do not want to limit your discussion, but I take the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of mentioning that the divisions before the Committee, and particularly the one to which you are addressing yourself, deal only with the Governor-General ‘s establishments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would be very concerned if it means that the Government is at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to increase that amount perhaps ten times over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable senator would know, I am not at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to disclose what happens at Cabinet meetings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I only hope that they will be as flexible and sensitive in the future when issues of this kind, particularly involving the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the subject, are raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the most potent weapons for fighting Communism in Asia are good wages, adequate food, social security and personal <span class="highlight">liberty</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government and those who support it have been challenged constantly by members of the Opposition because, as they say, we have not had the courage to justify and support the Government’s attitude in maintaining that the security of South Vietnam is an appropriate cause for people who desire <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and democracy throughout the world to espouse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I were at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> do do so within the confines of this Bill I would explain it to the honourable senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is opposed to people having the right to show their freedom or their <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to justify peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator is stretching the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> that was given to him to speak to the point of order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am convinced that the average Australian believes in his own mind that the greatest insurance policy which any Australian government can give this country is by cooperating and working with the United Slates in the fight for freedom and <span class="highlight">liberty</span> not only in this country but in other countries which need our assistance, lt staggers me to hear honourable senators opposite who are failing in what their Party has stood for over the years - the love of democracy and the belief that we should help the underdog and those people who need help - now talk as they have done tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 hope that this issue in Vietnam will continue until the Vietcong, the North Vietnamese and the Communists will be so crushed that the flower of <span class="highlight">liberty</span> will blossom and grow much greater and much better than ever before in the South East Asian area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I only hope that the leaders of this Government, instead of sitting back and taking a defensive attitude, will take more of the offensive in this political fight and show the Australian people that what is being done is the right thing for the preservation of <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sena:or WHEELDON- If  Senator Young  wishes to say that a majority of members of the United States Senate are traitors and subversives, he is entirely at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to do so but 1 do not think this statement would be taken seriously by the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should South African teams be banned and teams from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics welcomed, when the Red Army has repressed <span class="highlight">liberty</span> in the Baltic countries, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Austria and a host of other countries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700519_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is the freedom and <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the subject in union activities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I lake the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of referring to one or two passages of the Minister’s second reading speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if  Senator Webster  likes to continue to deny his own Prime Minister he is at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might take the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of reading a report of newspaper articles which appeared at the time and which made reference to our joint venture and our joint deputation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, any airline operator or charter operator is at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to make unlimited his normal liability policies if he so desires by the payment of an additional premium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he is offered a higher commercial value than the assessed commercial value he is completely at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to accept the higher offer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position with respect to those matters that I am at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to mention appears from the following list <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-97-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable senator wants to tell Waikerie Co-operative Distillery Limited that it is exploiting the South Australian public he is at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole thing is a lot of hyprocisy by people who have no time for human rights and <span class="highlight">liberty</span> but who are attempting to serve the interests of people in North Vietnam who, in many cases, are of their own kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no use  Senator Greenwood  saying that the preventing of  Mr Gregory  from coming to Australia is not an infringement of the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of anybody in Australia because it is an infringement of the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an infringement of the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of Australians to have contact with people from other countries who have been invited to come to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the very thing against which people are fighting for their <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and freedom in many countries today and the sort of activity that everybody condemns when it is applied to international airlines and somebody wants to hijack an aircraft and use it as a terrorist gesture against the rest of the community in order to gain his ends no matter what happens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should be at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to take an oath or make an affirmation, and there should be no question of grounds or otherwise - let alone the possibility of some inquiry into his grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely this is a transgression by the Commonwealth Parliament of the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of citizens to perform commercial activities within the States without interference from the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if an arrangement were made between the States and the Commonwealth it would be an interference with the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the individual to conduct his business in the manner in which he thinks fit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that the purpose of this Bill is to set up an Australian Wool Commission, if the Commission were allowed to collect ‘information of such kinds as the Minister approves’, it would amount to a complete interference with the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the greatest safeguard of civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the people of the Territory is free speech and a free Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, as I have said, it is obvious that at this late hour the Government has had second thoughts about the legislation and in some respects is tightening it up with respect to the rights and <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, if the Government backbenchers who have expressed to the Government some concern about the untidiness of this part of the legislation and asked for amendments to be moved by the Government at this late stage are in fact concerned about the right of the individual citizen and the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the subject, they should certainly be prepared to go all the way with the amendment that I have moved on behalf of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They can be best preserved and maintained and developed in an atmosphere of considerable academic <span class="highlight">liberty</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the universities are not prepared to lay down appropriate rules and regulations in regard to some fundamental matters then it is only to be expected that students will take the utmost <span class="highlight">liberty</span> which they sense they are entitled to within the broad restraints by which they regard themselves limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of reading some short extracts from 2 of the speeches delivered in support of  Mr Anthony’s  speech by the senior and junior vicepresidents of the Queensland Cane Growers Council at that meeting on Friday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are exporters under the present system at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to determine their own contractual arrangements; if so, do these arrangements vary from State to State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of reading for the benefit of honourable senators a document that has been sent out by us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-88-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So,  1  take the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of suggesting this small change in the form of words in the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister, who has been interested in questions of civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span>, whether he will ascertain from the PostmasterGeneral and also perhaps from the Attorney-General whether the following report which appeared in the ‘Sunday Review’ is true: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710331_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>From the above observations, wc solemnly declare that: We strongly oppose the action of sending troops to Laos by the government of Nguyen Van Thieu because it contrasts with the aspirations of the Vietnamese people and with the human ideals of peace, <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710401_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It certainly, so far as I would feel at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to comment and be helpful in making any comment, brings a point to bear upon the inadvisability of mixing sport with politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710420_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Australian National Line, as a partner in the Pacific Australia Direct Line, consult the Government before this step was taken; if not, is the Australian National Line now at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> similarly to withdraw from the Australia Northbound Shipping Conference if current discussions in that Conference do not produce acceptable results to the Australian National Line, and, if not, what were the special circumstances that warranted the withdrawal from the Australia/New Zealand and South Sea Islands Pacific Coast Conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710420_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that these are questions to be raised at the Committee stage, but I mention them now as an indication of the matters which will be raised at that stage and to show that it is the desire of the Government to lake away the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of individuals and to justify its action for election purposes by creating a fear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Murphy  said that this is something novel to the law, that this is something which is being introduced for the first time by this Government, that this is something which should be resisted as an undue intrusion upon the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the subject and something which has such novelty value that it should be regarded as a most reprehensible intrusion into civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Speaking for myself - I ask the Minister to consider this - when looking through the area of civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span> one of the few provisions in the Commonwealth law which has appealed to me over the years has been section 8a of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt has given me a better appreciation of the country in which I live; the country that has given me freedom and <span class="highlight">liberty</span>; the country that has given me the opportunity of doing something, feeble as though it may be and unrecognised as it will be for people I represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think I am at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to discuss what took place at that meeting, but the same kind of argument that we heard from  Senator Wilkinson  and  Senator Byrne  tonight was advanced at that meeting as the reason for wanting to deprive honourable senators of certain of their rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But America responded and it was because of that response that we continue to enjoy the freedom and <span class="highlight">liberty</span> which we have and for which so many noble men and women made the supreme sacrifice in many theatres of war during World War I and World War II and in Korea and Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In South East Asia, Australia has been identified with the policy that if we can support the economies and maintain and improve the social stability of the areas to which I have referred and of those countries further north, such as Thailand, Cambodia and South Vietnam, that in itself will call a halt to the processes of infiltration and subversion and, in more general terms, will provide containment - not aggressive containment but defensive containment - of those who otherwise would burst through and rob nations of their <span class="highlight">liberty</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government, having been furnished with the results of my efforts in this connection, has concluded, and I think few, if any, will deny, that there are practices current in the community which by reason of their restrictive nature are harmful to the public interest - that interest being in the maintenance of free enterprise under which citizens are at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to participate in the production and distribution of the nation’s wealth, thus ensuring competitive conditions which tend to initiative, resourcefulness, productive efficiency, high output and fair and reasonable prices to the consumer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I rise to say that it ill behoves the Australian Labor Party to pose as it does tonight and as it has day after day in the past as the keepers and trustees of human <span class="highlight">liberty</span> when in fact the record shows that in both the State and Federal spheres they were the most tyrannous governments in Australia’s history in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The clauses in this Part deal, of course, only with the question of admission of evidence and do not go to questions of substantive law, but because the Senate is always specially concerned with any legislation that has some bearing upon the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the subject I shall also deal with the various changes in the law on these matters in some detail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In general, British justice has gone to great pains to allow a person on trial for his <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to present his case as best he can and not to impair an accused’s right to discredit or attack others unless the attack is of little or no relevance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But in the intervening period I have taken the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and the opportunity to do some sample tests in the State of  Victoria  to ascertain precisely what is happening in the Department of Social Services in respect of the processing of the claims of those persons who lodged applications for unemployment benefit during the course of the industrial dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#debate-68">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I do make this point: It is clear that people who engage in demonstrations in the streets  do  so in defiance of the law and use the cloak of crowds in order to provoke violent situations which cause damage to property and are a potential risk to the life and <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In deciding on a programme of action which will contribute effectively to alleviation of the problem without, at the same time, unduly trespassing on people’s personal <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of choice the Government has decided that its proper role is that of taking steps available to it to ensure that all people are fully and properly informed of the dangers to their health of cigarette smoking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, as it has been raised, the only other comment I make is that a number of people would find it strange to hear so much talk about <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and what an infringement on <span class="highlight">liberty</span> it is to place inhibitions on the advertising of one drug - nicotine - which is known to be dangerous and at the same time hear the contention that there should be a total prohibition, including the imposition of penal sanctions, on the possession of marihuana - not because marituana has been proved to be dangerous but because it has not been proved not to be dangerous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, is it impossible for the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  to tell us what prisoners are in the gaols of this country at the present time on really serious or heinous offences, such as the crimes of murder or rape, who would be, in effect, entitled to their <span class="highlight">liberty</span> if the present situation persisted in which doubt is cast on all decisions of the courts made, say, within the last 20 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We want to see this problem solved, but we want to see it solved within a framework of respect for the high principles of civic justice and civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span> for which we on this side of the chamber stand and to which honourable senators on the other side of the chamber constantly pay lip service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I feel that I must bring before the Senate a very serious matter which indicates that an Australian citizen has been deprived of his <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and passport in a European country without in my view any proper process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today I received a letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr N. H. Bowen)  in which he said that on 12th September I asked whether any information could be given about a naturalised Australian citizen who was not born in Yugoslavia but who had been deprived of his <span class="highlight">liberty</span> in Yugoslavia on the basis that he was required to do military service for that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An Australian citizen who was not born in Yugoslavia has been deprived of his passport and <span class="highlight">liberty</span> in Yugoslavia on the ground that he owes military service to that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>H  Senator Negus  wishes to withdraw the amendment that he has moved and not to proceed with the other amendments that he has foreshadowed he certainly is at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I feel perfectly at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to discuss this matter in the widest sense, based upon information which has come to me and other members of the Committee in the course of its inquiries into this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To help you reach it I would take, the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of inviting you to look at the record, and I would like the opportunity to make a very brief submission to you so that you may take all factors into account before reaching your decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Appeals now involve mostly the personal <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of people rather than the personal life of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that every industry is at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to make a submission to the Government which will receive proper consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I think I said yesterday in a reply to a question on revaluation, and which I think was made clear also by the Prime Minister in his statement in December last, industries which feel they have suffered disadvantages as a result of the Government’s decision to revalue the dollar in December last are at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to make submissions to the Government which will give them proper consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic rationale of the speciality rule is to safeguard the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the person and protect his human rights, especially where a person is only accused of an offence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So while we support the measure that is before the Senate, I rake the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of observing that a wideranging and widespread distribution of a large amount of money - and when dealing with social welfare both this government and previous Governments were dealing with large amounts of money - does not necessarily solve all social welfare problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the Acts provide that the Attorney-General should not issue a warrant for the return of a fugitive if he has substantial grounds for believing that, if the fugitive is surrendered to the requesting country, ‘he may be prejudiced at his trial, or punished, detained or restricted in his personal <span class="highlight">liberty</span> by reason of his race, religion, nationality or political opinions’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#debate-8">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you treat people in that way, deprive them of their <span class="highlight">liberty</span>, try to destroy their culture and deny them any adequate form of representation, obviously violent elements in that community will come to the front, as has happened here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has always been the practice of Australian higher courts to grant priority to the bearing and determination of appeals in capital cases on ground of humanity, and because the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the subject is at stake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a matter of civil rights, perhaps one of the foremost of civil rights, that a person is to be secure in his life and <span class="highlight">liberty</span>, and that he should not be living in a society Where others can injure him and take away his life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The critical thing to my mind is not so much the fears of what might be done by some other country but that where that is the position, that <span class="highlight">liberty</span> should not depend upon the viewpoint of any individual, if that can be avoided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Too often in our lawand even in areas away from the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the subject- we have fallen into the error of substituting the individual discretion of officers, however highly placed, for the objective provisions of the law, so that we have had again and again in various enactments over the years the provision that the rights of a person should depend upon the discretion of some official rather than upon what has been directly provided by Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Czechoslovak Government is so illiberal that recently it built a high wooden fence around the grave of a youth who sacrificed his life in the course of <span class="highlight">liberty</span> 3 years ago, and the graves of others, so that the people of Czechoslovakia could not lay wreaths on those graves, and it told the people that they were prohibited from going there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Part II of the Bill then proceeds to deal with a number of important rights, including the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, the right to hold opinions without interference, the right to freedom of expression, the right to peaceful assembly, the right to freedom of association, the right, without unreasonable restrictions, to take part in the conduct of public affairs, vote at elections held by universal and equal suffrage and to hold public office, the right to <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of movement, and the right to privacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since I became a member of this Senate I have yet to hear any member of the Opposition express any concern about the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of any person from anywhere other than a communist country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are exercising our rights and are at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to point out the basic fallacies in the Budget of which this is a part and the contradictions and, indeed, the stupidities in many cases of the arguments that are being advanced by the Government in support of these increases in postal and telecommunication charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those societies which have chosen to leave the production of goods and services largely in the hands of private individuals and companies also enjoy a degree of personal <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and political freedom that has been rare in history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expression of these attitudes and aspirations is largely possible because of that personal <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and political freedom inherent in private enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Men and women who offend against the laws of society, as we accept them, must pay for their social sins but we have no right in a so-called civilised society to treat those who have been deprived of their <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and personal freedom with physical punishment and undignified procedures that label them as less than animals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth respectfully showeth: whereas the countries and peoples now being administered by communist governments-Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Russia, China, North Korea, North Vietnam, Romania, Yugoslavia, Mongolia, East Germany, Bulgaria, Albania and Cuba- are entrapped by political and economic ideals repugnant to Australian concepts of <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and fair play; and whereas the freedom of religion, assembly, speech, movement, fair trial, and enterprise are denied to these people by their governments; and whereas Opposition political parties are suppressed, the right to strike refused, and conscripted labour cruelly exploited by these same governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable senator wishes to refer to the ex-Attorney-General, she is at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A classic example is the way in which throughout the world over many years communists have used freedom of speech, freedom of association and all the democratic traditions under which they can work to undermine democracy and <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and to establish their own dictatorship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand, if they preferred to use the stream of counselling procedures in what I might term the private sector they would be equally at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Obviously the Government is at <span class="highlight">liberty</span>, if it so desires, to look at the implications of the possibility of that legislation being rejected by the Senate but the present intention is to ensure that this legislation comes before Parliament in the normal way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In respect of Hallett Cove, at question time I took a greater <span class="highlight">liberty</span> than I am prepared to take in this Estimates debate when I said that it was a subject I knew something about because I had walked over Hallett Cove, had climbed all the hills and rocks, gone into amphitheatre and everything there with a geologist and had everything explained to me in a fight to get money out of the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So honourable senators will see that a precedent has been created, and I do not think that anybody would assert that the business of the South Australian Parliament has been impeded by the members of that House being at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to dress as they desired, whether it be in shorts and shirt or in a safari suit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It concerns us very much because it demonstrates that the Government, and in particular the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Senator Willesee),  are not taking a stand consistent with the long record of this country in matters of civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That whereas our constitutional parliamentary democracy was developed on the Rights of Magna Carta to preserve for all time to the Australian people their cherished right to live as free men and women, enjoying complete <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of worship, assembly, speech, movement, the communication of knowledge and information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 20 November 1973, the Prime Minister sent a further teleprinter message to the Premier of Queensland pointing out that, in addition to the provisions with respect to property management, there were other features of the Queensland legislation with respect to Aborigines and Islanders that were unsatisfactory from a civil liberties’ viewpoint, including provisions relating to <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of movement to enter a reserve, legal representation before and appeal from Aboriginal courts, and relating to compulsory labour and conformity to a code of conduct on reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-I await the day when, instead of bleating ‘Hear, hear’, a Liberal Party senator gets up in this place and tells us how the State governments in this country are at the moment safeguarding the individual <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the citizen and are bulwarks against authoritarianism, as has been claimed, because if one looks for authoritarianism in this country one does not find it in the national government- one finds it in the activities of the various State governments- and if one looks for efficiency one does not find it in the State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must examine the question: What ensures the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the individual in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is stated in the platform of the Liberal Party that we do it through the States because they are somehow the guardians of individual <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and because they save us from the threat of central government authoritarianism and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, he said that there is a prohibition of <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of movement to enter a reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concerning the prohibition of <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to enter a reserve, this is the most important provision that the community people wish preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the elementary basis of <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and freedom, and you are the ones who are stopping it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that we of the Liberal Party of Australia- some people of this nationhave some obligation to ensure that basic questions of <span class="highlight">liberty</span> are preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#debate-93">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is necessary for a government to alter the rate of change, then a government is at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and Immigration whether Press reports are correct that the Australian Labor Party conference in Terrigal last week agreed to include in the Party’s platform a clause which in part states sympathetic consideration of people who for political and other reasons would face danger to life and <span class="highlight">liberty</span> upon return to their country of origin’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason, I would not be at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to indicate the price which has been negotiated in the meat deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any employee or any worker is at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> if he has a job and feels that he can improve his position elsewhere or if he feels a sense of insecurity in his present employment, to register with the CES for an alternative position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to make public the price but I think that the return to the producer is a little more than the figures which have been cited by the honourable senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Political <span class="highlight">liberty</span> does not mean that people can get into the gutter and do what they like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third criterion is that the court should be so constructed that it is capable of being publicly seen as a coherent judicial body with a capacity for uniformity of approach not only to great issues affecting the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of individuals and the quality of their lives but also to the resolution of issues between citizens and the Government and between citizen and citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs: Following the recent inclusion in the Australian Labor Party platform of a provision for ‘sympathetic consideration of people who for political and other reasons would face danger to life and <span class="highlight">liberty</span> upon return to their country of origin’, what will the Government’s attitude be to the people of the South Vietnamese and Cambodian embassies requesting asylum in Australia if their present countries and governments should tragically fall? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Bill there are provisions- on my reading they are serious infringements of the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the subjectrequiring things to be done by brokers and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he wants to say something when I finish speaking, he is quite at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its desperate attempt to perpetuate itself in office the Labor Party is attempting to destroy political <span class="highlight">liberty</span>, and the Liberal Party will not have a bar of that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would be dishonest to the people of Australia, of all political persuasions, if we did not fight to protect them from this onslaught on their <span class="highlight">liberty</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they are the sorts of things he wants to go into he is at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to do that and he, like anyody else, would be at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to give evidence to the judicial committee which the amendment proposes to establish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If that information is not sufficient for  Senator Wright,  naturally he is at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to seek more detailed information which can be given to him by letter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is ironic that a very active member of the DLP, an organisation which demanded conscription of Australian youth, which was the most hysterical advocate of fire and slaughter in Indo-China, which sponsored television advertisements which purported to show that  Chairman  Mao was responsible for the atrocities of Belsen, and which blythely ignored the tiger cages of Con Son’ and the atrocities perpetrated by the former rulers of Saigon, should have the effrontery to pose as a person genuinely concerned about protecting life and.individual <span class="highlight">liberty</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would not canvass whether she was right or wrong, but certainly she was at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to make her point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that I would have been at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to recommend and justified in recommending to my Government that if they wanted to go it alone they could go it alone and we would go it alone; but I do not think it would have been in the interests of the beef industry to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The preamble of that Act said that, under the prevailing economic conditions developed with the aid of Government authority for owners of property to organise in the corporate and other forms of ownership or association, the individual unorganised worker was commonly helpless to exercise actual <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of contract to promote his freedom of labour and thereby obtain acceptable terms and conditions of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that time will tell, if the Opposition’s amendment is carried, whether or not it is adequate, but at the present time to reverse the onus and to allow this clause to remain in the Bill would be a breach of the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> which we have understood and enjoyed for many centuries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘Civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span> in this kingdom has two direct guarantees; the open administration of justice according to known laws truly interpreted, and fair constructions of evidence; and the right of Parliament, without let or interruption, to inquire into, and obtain redress of, public grievances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is wise to see whether the Opposition’s amendment, which is the least restrictive of <span class="highlight">liberty</span>, would be the cause in which it is done and I support the Opposition’s amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I readily concede that what the Minister said would help to make it a less onerous provision than it is at the moment but this is an area where I think the ultimate purposes of the Bill are better served and where the purposes to which the Opposition parties subscribe, namely, to have as wide a <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of expression as possible, will be aided by objecting to the clause in toto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for that, as was given over many decades, was that such a system as is embraced within this Bill ran counter to the concept of the rule of law, and the argument went that the rule of law implied the absence of wide discretionary powers in the Government affecting the personal <span class="highlight">liberty</span>, the private property rights and the freedom of contract of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If rights exist which can be used to rectify injustice to prevent the violation of principle and to maintain some of our crumbling structure of <span class="highlight">liberty</span>, it will be surprising indeed if, in the ultimate, free Englishmen fail to make use of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I find it ironic, to say the least, that people who oppose the extension of public ownership with quasireligious zeal very strongly tend to be the same people who were eager to maintain the premium on what they call our insurance policy with the United States, when the premium in question was someone else’s life or someone else’s physical <span class="highlight">liberty</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Workers Party advocates that Government power should be gradually reduced till the Government is responsible only for the defence of Australia (non-existent at present), for the protection of honest Australians against criminals (at present the police are handicapped by unnecessary laws which restrict individual freedom), and the maintenance of a legal system to protect individual <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and the rights of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The other point I regretfully make is that from the way in which  Senator Greenwood  handles these problems it is fairly obvious, I think, that he is more interested in exacerbating a very difficult problem between 2 countries rather than in the life and <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the individuals concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751002_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, I suggest to the honourable senator that the practice that exists now can continue to exist and that if, after perusal of the report an honourable senator seeks to have the matter debated in the Parliament, he is at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to make such an application to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is need for a determined campaign by all Australians- and that means all parties and all senators who have some understanding of the problem- by all those who value <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and freedom and the rights of people, to see that this grave miscarriage of justice is not ratified and that the incorporation does not take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span> in this kingdom has two direct guarantees; the open administration of justice according to known laws truly interpreted, and fair constructions of evidence; and the right of Parliament, without let or interruption, to inquire into, and obtain redress of, public grievances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat what the Minister said because I think it is of fundamental importance that the people of Australia and honourable senators on the other side of the chamber understand that the spurious attempts by the trade unions to fine people for legitimately offering themselves to an employer for work is a complete negation of the principles of democracy and civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some might say that in suggesting that no Prime Minister would conduct himself in such an unconstitutional manner as to flout the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the citizen an immodest claim is being made for the superiority of the British politician; yet this is not necessarily an egoistic attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, let me hasten to assure you that if any patient has a difficulty, he or she is quite at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to talk to the administration about it, and would certainly get a sympathetic and understanding hearing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope they will be concerned also about deprivation of civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and human rights in Southern Africa, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay- the last 3 traditional parliamentary democracies, all of which have been destroyed, not by the Left but by the capitalist class- by the extreme Right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>if the representative system is to survive then we can no longer order our politics so that those of us who share basic under-lying assumptions about freedoms, about the supremacy of the individual over the state, continuously light each other in essentially mock adversorial political battles … We must also have the courage to call a halt to the increasing growth of those institutions, the state, the unions, the bureaucracies which are weakening our resistance to incursions on <span class="highlight">liberty</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the continuation of disturbing reports from Uganda to the effect that the murder of political detainees is still routine- the lastest example being the apparent battering to death of a British-born businessman,  Mr Robert  Scanlen- will the Minister indicate whether the Government is currently aware of the whereabouts of any Australian citizens residing in Uganda and whether such persons are still at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and safe? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should have thought that there were some difficulties in accommodating the entire economic interests of this country and at the same time, as the Speech purported to do, accommodating the civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span> needs of the whole of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point, which I shall reiterate for  Senator Wright’s  benefit, is simply this: The notion of economic freedom does not necessarily lie well with the notion of individual <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and individual freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How will this Parliament, if it cannot solve present problems of the kind to which I have referred, be able to solve the problems, in terms of individual <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and so on, of the communications technology which is changing so rapidly, of medical science, of genetic engineering, of ecological disruption or of the breakdown of urban complexes and large cities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the presence of such force there is no resistance; <span class="highlight">liberty</span> is a word without meaning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why should not all legislation be referred to a committee which has the assistance of counsel, which looks at legislation from a purely technical point of view, which sees whether the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the subject is transgressed, whether there are unnecessary averment clauses, whether the onus of proof is being reversed, whether the legislation is retroactive and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of mentioning these remarks because this is an occasion on which we review the activities of Parliament and in particular put on record the importance, the role and the responsibility of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, a penal prohibition sought to be imposed by the State upon what an individual does abroad involves a restriction on the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the individual which we think can only be justified on compelling grounds of public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of the subclauses is to protect the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the subject if the Attorney-General does not give his consent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill also makes it quite clear that although the Industries Assistance Commission is requested to report on the level of assistance required to maintain the desired level of activity and employment in the industry at the time of the reference, it is at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to recommend a lower level of assistance, but it is required to state its reasons for doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I must say to  Senator Georges  that the intention was to avoid the cluttering up of the Notice Paper but the main aim in respect of reports being tabled was that honourable senators might have time to look at the reports, to assess them and then give notice- and they are quite at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to do so at any time- that they will seek leave to move that the Senate take note of the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On all occasions there has surely to be a balance between security and the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all know that murder, muggings, holdups, rapes and other types of attacks on personal freedom and <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and the right to the preservation of personal integrity, take place; but what we try to do as a society is create a balance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Again, this legislation offends demonstrably against concepts of civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and it offends grievously against this Government’s professed interest, which has been continuing for a long time now, in freedom of information legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Senator Rae  says, the question is: Where does <span class="highlight">liberty</span> cease and licence start? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am not at <span class="highlight">liberty</span>, of course, to do anything other than to express a view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of every individual citizen in this country must be put to the final test as to whether it contests the overriding public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great little game has been played in this regard by the Labor Party over the years, that is, never to allow criticism at all- try to stop criticism- of any action of the ABC by way of its public statements or programs because if it can intimidate the Government into being frightened to make any criticism the ABC can have not only <span class="highlight">liberty</span> but also licence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second comment I make is that when I hear particular members of the Liberal Party proclaiming their grave concern about this vital principle which is being violated by what they call retrospective taxation legislation they remind me of those other Liberals- frequently they are precisely the same Liberals- who fomented or pontificated about the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the individual while simultaneously voting for conscription to send Australian youth to the Vietnam war and similar wars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They proclaim themselves to be the defenders of the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the individual against the real or potential tyranny of the State while simultaneously voting for the tyranny of the State for which confiscates the personal physical freedom or even the life of arbitrarily selected individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that anyone reading the extract of what the Minister said in his second reading speech and what is contained in the sub-clauses of the Bill would be entitled to believe that the States do not have the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to do exactly what they like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But its program calls for a Westernstyle parliamentary system, guarantees of civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and an equitable distribution of wealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As democratic socialists- we bear the label proudly- we stand for the values of equality, <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and democracy: greater real equality in the distribution of wealth, income, power and status in the community; full respect for the personal freedom and dignity of the individual; the fullest possible opportunity for democratic participation by every individual in all the major decisions that affect his or her life in the work place and in the local community as much as in the larger political sphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I will point out later, that is scarcely compatible with ideas of personal <span class="highlight">liberty</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is my first speech in the Parliament and I understand that I may take some <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to speak in a general and introductory way about my own political philosophy as a Liberal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reality is that the condition of <span class="highlight">liberty</span> in Queensland has assumed all the dimensions of a national scandal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United Nations Human Rights Commission, which  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  has had the temerity to call in aid on his own behalf, would, I suggest, be only too delighted to have an opportunity to scrutinise the state of <span class="highlight">liberty</span> in  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  ‘s own backyard and to consider not only the treatment of Aborigines in Aurukun and Mornington Island, which the Premier himself concedes to be at least controversial, but also the systematic denigration of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders generally in that State which is embodied in the legislation of that State which purports to govern the affairs of those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It relates to undertakings which have been given by Ministers over a period of years to the Regulations and Ordinances Committee in relation to complaints about regulations and ordinances which we have considered to be inadequate, which have perhaps interfered with the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the subject or, on one of the particular criteria of the Committee, have been found to be offending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there is a question of the physical <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and freedom of movement of the subject involved here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no objective criterion against which any deprivation of <span class="highlight">liberty</span> which the officer in question might be minded to impose can either at the time or after the event be tested by any court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only say that the drafting of the Bill was not intended in any way to attack the personal <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of a person or to make it impossible for him to proceed with his travel plans bearing in mind that we are now introducing a departure tax that is to be collected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the courts become disposers of those who are socially inconvenient the road ahead would lead to the destruction of <span class="highlight">liberty</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate remains an important cog in the machinery of parliamentary government and, as such, is one of the bulwarks of <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and of private and public wealth and well-being in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may take the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of saying so, we can see that nothing much has changed because  Senator Guilfoyle  continues to wield her accountant’s scalpel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the mounting concern which has come to be expressed by democrats around the world in recent years at the condition of civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span> in West Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would certainly concede that the restrictions that have been imposed on <span class="highlight">liberty</span> in West Germany and to which I propose to advert briefly bear no resemblance whatsoever to the curbs on <span class="highlight">liberty</span> which exist in the German Democratic Republic, that is Eastern Germany, which are manifestly worse than anything that West Germany has been able to manage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am taking the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of forwarding a copy of this communication to each of your Cabinet colleagues, to all members of Cabinet in Queensland and further to all members of the Police Federation of Australia who will be discussing this problem at their Federation’s Conference in Adelaide from 13 March onwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are dealing with the rights of the individual and matters such as expense and inconvenience should never be given consideration when the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and good name of the individual is at stake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am being very careful about what I am saying because I know that as parliamentarians any one of us may feel that there is a suppression of ideas by political censorship but on the other hand we get back to the very fine distinction between <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and licence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What cannot be ignored is the absolute need to ensure that where breaches of the normal rules relating to the protection of life, <span class="highlight">liberty</span> or property are concerned, some law be certain and available to deal with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a half-hearted, cavalier manner the Leader of the Government in the Senate said:  ‘Senator Colston  is quite at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and is entitled to put those facts on the record of the Parliament’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that, having regard to the need to balance the interests of the State with the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the individual, the Senate should deal with the legislation in a calm and deliberate way, and that the Government should be responsive to any suggestions which may improve it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that to that extent the responsibility lies even more heavily upon us as a House of review and indeed the Parliament as a whole to maintain a watching brief as far as possible over all activities which impinge in any way upon the security or the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the individual citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are not prepared to accept is this Bill which goes much further, in our suggestion, than it needs to in authorising interferences with or restrictions on personal <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and which does not go nearly far enough in incorporating within it the kinds of checks and balances which we believe are quite indispensable if security legislation is ever to be acceptable in a democratic society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not live in such a society and it would be absurd to permit individuals whose professed aim is to destroy our economic system to cripple our security service in the name of individual <span class="highlight">liberty</span>, a concept in which they do not believe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a passionate belief in civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and a determination that I shall not allow those rights to disappear in cases where that can be avoided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the reenactment of this legislation should come before this Parliament so that we can carry out our duties as legislators and ensure that we have not sacrificed the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the people by giving too much power to public servants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I took the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of drawing to the attention of the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  the matter which I will now outline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we are nearing the time when, with the restrictions on freedom and <span class="highlight">liberty</span> in Queensland, there shall be greater violence in that State than we have experienced in other States of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party vigorously advocates individual <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and the fundamental rights of freedom of speech, organisation, assembly, procession, religion and non-violent dissent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of us who are in the radical movement surrender to no one our defence of the principles of <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and freedom, of the right of assembly or of any of the principles that are embodied in the platform of the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of commenting on what  Mr Viner  said today in another place when he virtually heaped tons of praise on the Queensland Government for its enlightened attitude to Aborigines in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After that,  Mr Fraser  will be at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> really to put the screws on the States financially and, by that indirect means, force the State governments to impose a State income tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of referring to the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution which a few years ago tabled a report in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say in summary- I will add further weight to this point later- that the reason why the Opposition is insisting upon this amendment and is so concerned about it is simply the magnitude of the invasions of personal <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and, in particular, personal privacy that are associated with the exercises of these powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That might be construed by the Minister of the day as a statutory direction that he take only these considerations into account and not concern himself with other considerations of principle or civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not talking simply of dozens of people or even scores of people but are talking about each year thousands of people and scores of thousands of different conversations being intercepted and recorded by the security service, with all the implications that that state of affairs has for the condition of privacy and the condition of civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the purpose of imposing a time limit in the AttorneyGeneral’s mind, as in our minds, is that in dealing with this dangerous area from the point of view of the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the subject, a person like the Attorney-General should be called upon to apply his mind to these important considerations from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am therefore thrown back very largely on the sort of situation to which  Senator Button  referred- I think with some degree of disquiet- that is, that to a large extent the rights, reputation, <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and perhaps even the future career prospects of individual Australian citizens will be in large part determined by the personal attitude of whoever happens to be the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But their voice ought to be heard because the best guarantee of a society’s status is one which genuinely preserves and respects civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span> in a society that gives exactly the same consideration to minority groups which might be thought unattractive or disreputable to mainstream people in our society like  Senator Sim  and others with whom he sits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I took the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of conferring with the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that, in making a point in explanation and clarification, I am not at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to debate the substance of the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ACTING  DEPUTY PRESIDENT-  You are quite at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to move dissent from my ruling if you want to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation calls for application of a principle of construction comparable ‘to that which requires that a statute, which is intended to abridge the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the subject, should use plain language to express that intention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the expressionistic response that one gets, simply from scanning the publicly-available information, it is obvious that delays of eight, nine or 10 months, even in matters involving directly and immediately the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the subject are commonplace in this Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- On behalf of the Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Wriedt)  I simply say that the Opposition regards this situation that besets the Government as one in which a very fine decision has to be made between <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and licence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me of fundamental importance, with the Westminster style of government which we have in Australia, that the separation of powers is the best safeguard of the individual’s <span class="highlight">liberty</span>; that is, the more we can devolve power throughout the administrative structure within our country and the executive arm of government, the more likely it is that the interests and the liberties of individual Australians will be safeguarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in the interests of the individual’s <span class="highlight">liberty</span>, it is of the highest importance that the dissemination of that information should be authorised specifically by this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are proud of our democratic rights but the line between licence and <span class="highlight">liberty</span> is very fine indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those objections were raised in relation to what are basically civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span> issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a country such as this we should insist on the fundamental <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of being able use the telephone freely without fear of someone eavesdropping. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, in our opinion, far from strengthening the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the ordinary citizen, might very well have the opposite effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The potential for abuse, the potential for very widespread invasions of personal <span class="highlight">liberty</span>- in particular, personal privacy- is such that a whole series of safeguard mechanisms ought to be built into this legislation, not the least of which should be a requirement that the agency operate under a closer form of parliamentary scrutiny than it has operated under in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this also raises the question of the right to travel which in turn raises the more general issue of personal <span class="highlight">liberty</span> or any possible curtailment of the right of citizens in this country to participate in such organisations and their right to basic democratic freedom such as freedom of expression and freedom of religion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the implications for personnel <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of any curtailment of the right of citizens to participate in such organisations and their right to basic democratic freedoms; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The arrests of these people were all for what must be recognised, by any common standard of civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span> adopted in the world, as lawful acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this way one gets some idea of the suffering in Czechoslovakia when people are prepared to put their names to a document in the interest of human <span class="highlight">liberty</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is also incumbent on our Government to make some representations because of the concern for <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to which our country and our Government are dedicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate the point raised by  Senator Cavanagh,  which is consistent with the points he has made in this chamber from time to time, and that is a concern with the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that case we are in a great tradition of <span class="highlight">liberty</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A man’s <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of movement is regarded so highly by the law of England that it is not to be hindered or prevented except on the surest grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The passport issuing area is just one of those really crucial areas of civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span> which are a test of any government’s sincerity and credibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the whole debate on human <span class="highlight">liberty</span> over the centuries <span class="highlight">liberty</span>, subject to the rights of others, has been a profound qualification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we can see that, in determining the concept of human rights and human <span class="highlight">liberty</span>, the right to travel is recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our community we have very proper rules to determine the enlargement and the limiting of the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of individual citizens in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the specifics, I believe that this Bill is widening the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and dignity of the individual Australian abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is very much at <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to return the passport before then for safe keeping if one so desires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of reproducing what I wrote in a recent Full Bench decision: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may have the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> again to refer to the Prime Minister’s speech, I point out that he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This publication by AUS- I have the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> to say it is one of the weakest and most farcical that I have seen that organisation produce, which says a great deal-in terms of the ten points it puts forward exposes each one of those points severally and collectively as a great deal of nonsense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In order to assist with assessment I have taken the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of examining signatures appearing on the eighteen (18) sheets which make up the petition handed to me by  Mrs Yeatman <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that they were good laws, but one would think from listening to the propaganda which has been spread about the situation within West Germany, most of it coming from East Germany, that in West Germany severe restrictions are placed on one ‘s political activities but in East Germany it is <span class="highlight">Liberty</span> Hall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the common law tradition, which may influence judicial approaches towards favouring the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the subject in the interpretation of statutes or constitutional provisions has not always been all that self-evident in the decisions of our courts . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, <span class="highlight">Liberty</span> and the pursuit of Happiness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If people are interested in following this even further, I think the most perceptive thing written recently about this matter was published in 1977 in a book entitled  Individual <span class="highlight">Liberty</span> and the Law,  The Tagore Law Lectures delivered by the now Governor-General,  Sir Zelman  Cowen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally,  Sir Norman  Anderson again presenting a Hamlyn Lecture entitled ‘<span class="highlight">Liberty</span>, Law and Justice’ was at great pains to spend part of his discussion on illustrating why he believed the state of the common law in Great Britain was such as to require, in that country, the enactment of a Bill of rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one shall be deprived of his <span class="highlight">liberty</span> except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complaints have come from civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span> groups, employer groups, church groups, the United Nations Association of Australia, trade unions, a number of important citizens in our community and people in the legal fraternity who know what discrimination means because they have to deal with the rough side of discrimination almost every day in the law courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One finds throughout this Covenant ringing statements of <span class="highlight">liberty</span> that are immediately qualified by remarks recognising administrative convenience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone lawfully within the territory of a Slate shall, within that territory, have the right to <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of movement and freedom to choose his residence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there are other bodies such as the Immigration Control Association; the Immigration Restriction Council; the British Australian Association; the Ku Klux Klan, Melbourne branch; the Conservative Party (Western Australia) Inc.; Women Against Asian Immigration Committee; Westralian Nationalist Movement; National Australian Association; Truth and <span class="highlight">Liberty</span> Mission; British-Israel World Federation; and the Children of God. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other rights would spring from that right, for example, the right to property and to <span class="highlight">liberty</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>France had a revolution in which the cry was for <span class="highlight">liberty</span>, equality and fraternity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the beginning of time people have sought the good life, <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But even after Magna Carta, it took people a long time to realise that <span class="highlight">liberty</span> was an essential element in civilisation, and it was not until Charles I assented to the Petition of Rights that the idea of government by deliberation became feasible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it was here that we had individual <span class="highlight">liberty</span> ranged against the rights of Parliament and the absolute sovereignty of the King. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, <span class="highlight">liberty</span> and the pursuit of happiness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland inevitably comes in for a special degree of singling out and treatment because of the extraordinary width and diversity of the intrusions upon individual <span class="highlight">liberty</span> that have become characteristic of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the shortest catalogue of intrusions upon civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span> in Queensland would necessarily number a dozen major items. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, in Australia it is obvious that the Federal principle of letting the States do their own thing has produced nothing but a continued record of disaster with regard to civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span> principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do think that that kind of serious consequence for successful appellants involving the <span class="highlight">liberty</span> of the subject ought to be the subject of specific argument and justification, either by the Attorney-General in introducing and explaining the legislation or, preferably, by the Administrative Review Council, which is charged with the task of advising the AttorneyGeneral on such matters and, indeed, has made that recommendation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would add another string to the bow of the Human Rights Commission to at least be able to investigate and report upon the state of human rights, by reference to the standards in the Covenant, in the States and in the territories where most of the civil <span class="highlight">liberty</span> interfering action, as we know, takes place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are occasions- I recall reading about one before I entered this chamber- when, without any intention to do so and given the nature of a government’s program, a Bill is introduced into one chamber of the Parliament, proceeds to the other and becomes law without members or senators being alerted to the fact that there may be a serious possible infringement of a human right, personal <span class="highlight">liberty</span> or personal right in the operation of the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-94">[More…]</a></p>
