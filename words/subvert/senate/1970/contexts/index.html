<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Do the recent statements by  Mr McEwen,  the Minister for Trade and Industry, that the Australia to Europe shipping conference has abandoned negotiations in respect to a 10 per cent increase in freight and the announcement that it remains up to the various shipper groups representing the meat, dairy and canned fruit industries to decide on the 10 per cent increase mean that the Government has given up any hope of using the Trade Practices Act to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> this action or to use the Government’s interests in the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission to resist such increases? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the preoccupation and obsession linger on, even to the stage of persistence to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#debate-96">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the continuing incompetence, evasion, deceit and duplicity of the Prime Minister and his Ministers as exemplified in the overseas loan scandal which was an attempt by the Government to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the Constitution, to by-pass Parliament and to evade its responsibilities to the States and the Loan Council; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not <span class="highlight">subvert</span> them in the military action they are forced to take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt was hoped that this could be done by slandering the people taking part in the demonstrations, by intimidating them and by holding them out as people willing to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So long as it is understood that this issue, under the guise of the disallowance of a regulation, is just another effort to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> or undermine the National Service Act, I am prepared to commit the matter to Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally the Manager as the senior officer would be the one to decide, at least in the first instance, on what is a reasonable standard of conduct, what acts <span class="highlight">subvert</span> good order and what interferes with normal duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same position could well develop in South East Asia if China, for example, having a minority ethnic group available to it in some of the countries to our north, as a protecting power tried to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> any one of these countries by the stimulation of the minority movements in any of them and that country became an accommodating power to China, or to any other nation not friendly to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Government intends to tie down the unions completely, to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the traditional role of the conciliation and arbitration tribunals and generally to make it more difficult for organised labour to maintain wage and industry standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to underline the fact that you would like to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the Australian Government’s performance which has been marked by a permanent expression of hope that when the Territory asked for self-government and assumed the responsibilities of independence, Australia would have foreseen it, made the provisions that facilitated it and immediately acceded to it on a responsible resolution of the peoples themselves to accept that responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, once a government has notice of activities designed to train terrorists and of plans to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> a recognised government if may be considered that a duty arises to suppress such activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to be all right if, inside Australia, we can train people in international Communist subversion and can send Communists overseas to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> and pervert. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because they have the numbers on the opposite side, honourable senators have become so arrogant with their power that they think that they can <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand, if it suits Australia’s book, it suits the Commonwealth of Nations and the general Western democracies to hold the peace and possibly to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> some Croatians who want independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are setting up a little junta within this Senate which will <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the purposes of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to a previous question the Leader of the Government referred to the Prime Minister’s impertinent and unauthorised intervention in the dispute by suggesting the intrusion of a federal judge to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the decision of the Industrial Commission of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In one proposal which is cognate to this we see a pattern of referenda designed to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the States and to alter the constitution of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy President,  within the ambit of your ruling I am compelled to say that the author of these proposals has a direct purpose, which is to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the States and to undermine this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But these things aside, it is an obvious purpose of the present Government to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the States and weaken them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an obvious purpose of the present Government to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the States House and weaken it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that it is not just an attempt to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the authority of State governments and an attempt to centralise further powers in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor says ‘No, we just think’-and I believe this is Labor’s aim- ‘of how it will <span class="highlight">subvert</span> this Senate and how it will <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the representation of the States’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the most ingenious, cunning trick that has been conceived to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian Federal governments have never tried to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the Constitution by, for example, extending the life of a Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party proposed referendums on anything and everything, but a responsible Senate thwarted the Government’s irresponsible attempts to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> our federal system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore this legislation is nothing short of an attempt to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the propriety of subverting the constitutional system of administrative processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This simple administrative act to which I have referred involves an attempt, firstly, to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the proprieties of parliamentary authority and, second, to subjugate the parliamentary authority of a Prime Minister who is temporarily embedded in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that the majority of the former Mapoon people are wise enough to see through the obvious manoeuvres of this diabolical attempt to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> them from being citizens of Queensland and Australia and reject it with the contempt it deserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am astounded, as my question today indicated, that the State Government of South Australia is endeavouring to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the new trade practices legislation that has been passed by the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he also argue that by giving state aid to church schools we are setting out to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the churches, because it would seem to me that if one is subverting religious and charitable institutions which conduct nursing homes by paying them these substantial sums of money, the same would apply to the schools which are conducted by religious and, if not charitable, then non-profit making organisations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it came to an electorate completely under the Labor Government’s control it attempted to pass through this Parliament a Bill to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the 20 per cent disparity which could occur between electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where could that thought have come from except from an entrenched government that was trying to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> our news media? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not want to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the Australian Agricultural Council which we so wonderfully support’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are going to be people setting out to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the electoral system by having mischievous candidates then I think it requires the government of the day to do something about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no question that it shall be subverted or slid around. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To do otherwise in this matter is to join in the most unsavoury single minded attempt to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> justice instead of to apply it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course he refers to the free enterprise capitalist system, except insofar as the Government can convert it or <span class="highlight">subvert</span> it to socialism in its worst form, as a most virulent disease. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure the Committee that the statement by the Treasurer is a clear indication that there is no intention on the part of the Government or of the Treasurer to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> in any way the processes of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The attitude that  Senator Steele  Hall has adopted that this training is something to be feared and that this trade union program will be used to indoctrinate or to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the worker and make him an enemy of society is a dishonest approach and he must know it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Regulations are not the proper vehicle to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> this Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I use a provocative term such as ‘<span class="highlight">subvert</span>’ because to subtract from this Tribunal’s jurisdiction will be the pressure of all the bureaucracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have a Prime Minister who sanctions the irresponsible expenditure of the taxpayers’ money on unwanted paintings that have offended most of his mandate, a Prime Minister who sanctions irresponsible expenditure on Aboriginal affairs to the detriment of Aborigines and the disadvantage of others, a Prime Minister who sanctions irresponsible expenditure on sordid films and proposes unhealthy law reform on incest, abortion and homosexuality, a Prime Minister whose every attempt to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> our Constitution - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Yes, I know, but the honourable senator has raised a question which has been ventilated in the Press in recent days about groups of people who are out to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> and to avoid the postal tariff proposals which have been put up by the Commission and authorised by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any group of people, whether on the Right or the Left, which tries to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> parliamentary democracy by going around the proper way of the ballot box ought to be condemned very roundly by all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
