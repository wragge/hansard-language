<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What he has not told the House is that the Bill that he has lauded is in fact a Bill which seeks to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> a constitutional provision that obliges the Commonwealth, if it acquires property compulsorily, to pay a just price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the continuing incompetence, evasion, deceit and duplicity of the Prime Minister and his Ministers as exemplified in the overseas loan scandal which was an attempt by the Government to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the Constitution, to by-pass Parliament and to evade its responsibilities to the States and the Loan Council; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister will be aware of recent reports of the formation of groups within Australia, particularly New South Wales, dedicated to the overthrow of foreign governments and the infiltration of political organisations to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> those organisations to their cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To try to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the present quota arrangements that have been arrivedat by the Australian wheat industry would do nothing but throw the whole wheat industry into absolute chaos. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is developed a conspiracy to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> it can operate under the protection of the freedoms to which it is directly or indirectly opposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second, and perhaps the most sinister onslaught, which would undermine our Western nations, would involve the use of mass media to completely <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the morality of the Western nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless and until we can get to a point where our draftsmen can do no more than help governments to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> or to get around the Constitution this Parliament will be an exercise in legal frustration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason is that those people aim to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> by undemocratic methods the type of society that we have and desire to maintain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as committees cannot <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the parties, they cannot circumvent the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if he means that the Communists hide their identity and their longer range aims in these movements - in other words, <span class="highlight">subvert</span> them - then all I can say is that the Communists have a very inefficient organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should now be more free to press the States to refurbish Australia’s international reputation by carrying out their obligations under those conventions which the Commonwealth alone can contract but which the States for too long have been allowed to frustrate or <span class="highlight">subvert</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I venture to say that both of those principles have been broken and subverted by those resolutions of the Labor Party Conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, from those examples that I have quoted - and indeed there are many others which one could quote - what some members of the Labor Party have done is to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> those very basic principles of the administration of law and justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a stabilisation scheme in Australia which, if it is to be effective, must not allow imports to come in and <span class="highlight">subvert</span> its operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attorney-General and in the Post Office and, indeed, in the Security Organisation itself, that we should have not merely an assurance but an absolute guarantee from the Attorney-General that the new mechanics of telephone tapping adopted by ASIO will not operate to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the authority reposed in him by the Telephonic Communications (Interceptions) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that 1 concur with my friend, the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden),  in his view that we are entitled to take the utmost steps that we wish to take with respect to what appears to be an intent to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the provisions of the Act by what might be called legal contrivances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take the firm view that most people in the community cannot avoid the legal obligation to pay taxation and that those who try to be clever about the inadequacies of the law deserve to be met with the harshest consequences if it is felt that they are subverting the principle of an Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We deplore the Government’s action in using intimidatory and other questionable tactics to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the course of wage justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, will the Prime Minister agree to such an inquiry, but will he ensure that any such investigation is not restricted to just this one group but covers all groups whose intention is to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> and to bring about chaos and anarchy within Australia on behalf of foreign ideologies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that the people behind the strikes are out to destroy or <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the democratic majority within the ALP as much as they are out to confront arbitration and the Government, such is the influence on the Australian Labor Party of the lunatic Left - the Hartleys, the Browns, the Crawfords - ‘that the Labor Party is forced to side with them in public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will certainly not permit its territory to be used for the training or preparation of any group which is engaged in an attempt to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> or overthrow the Government of any country with which we have friendly relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a distrust of foreign investment just because it is foreign; a willingness to do without the benefits of investment if it is foreign - to cut off the nose to spite the face; a disposition to see foreign investors as being engaged in a Machiavellian plot to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only do they cut directly across the rights of individual workers, but they introduce dangerous practices that can <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the time honoured system followed in these matters where there have been no allegations of abuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To suggest that this provision will allow shop stewards to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> their authority and to take more than their authority is to deny the words of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is always a little difficult in a cognate debate of this character - a debate on more than one Bill - to state one’s views with absolute clarity, especially in a matter such as this where I support the Bill which gives the extra member in the House of Representatives to the Australian Capital Territory but oppose most sincerely the Bill which endeavours to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> and change the basis of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the present Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has a predilection, like other Ministers in this Government, to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the use of these inspectors, I suspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless this Minister can answer the charges laid against him, he has reduced the power output from the Snowy Mountains scheme to New South Wales in a secretive and despicable fashion to try to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the industrial authority and law in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the peculiar alliance of the Country Party with some sections of manufacturing industry which grew up in the latter years of the Liberal-Country Party government, it was commonplace for the Country Party Ministers to do their utmost to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the mandatory provisions of the Tariff Board Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advice of the Industries Assistance Commission will <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the general policy recommendations that I believe are correctly the responsibility of government and not of an outside body of experts, no matter how expert they may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we sought to do then, by point of order, was to establish that error and, as I made clear on a couple of occasions that night, we said we would do whatever was necessary to co-operate in the correction of that error because we regarded it as an error and we believed that we should not take advantage of the error in order to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the particular piece of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it intended that the peace conference will <span class="highlight">subvert</span> that committee of inquiry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should be very reluctant to see the Chiefs of Staff Committee given wider responsibility than for operational matters, for this would <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the chain of responsibility through the functional divisions of the Defence Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He established his forces and he proceeded to suborn, <span class="highlight">subvert</span> and destroy Malaysia in order to prevent the British from carrying out their program of bringing that country to an appropriate independent status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Maribyrnong, the Minister for the Environment and Conservation  (Dr Cass),  who has done more than any man I know to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> one decent environmental organisation in Australia thinks that this is amusing, but he will not be in this Parliament after the business either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill does not, in my view, add very materially to the power of the Government to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the Australian economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for that reason that the Opposition does not want to see any alteration to the legislation which allows unions to by-pass or to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the arbitration system which has been established in Australia in the name of participatory democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government is trying to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the Constitution and to seek power in another fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Never before in the history of the Parliament have we seen a piece of legislation that attempts to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the Constitution in such a fashion and attempts to give such control to the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian Federal governments have never tried to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the Constitution by, for example, extending the life of a Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party proposed referendums on anything and everything, but a responsible Senate thwarted the Government’s irresponsible attempts to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> our federal system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore this legislation is nothing short of an attempt to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has set out deliberately to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> section 96 by twisting it to meet the demands of socialistic philosophies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that we should mark the fact that the communists have endeavoured to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the churches within their own jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker, few people have done more to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the democratic processes of this Parliament than has the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can scarcely imagine a more cynical or damaging way in which an Administration could <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the intentions of its own Cabinet decision than this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely we could argue that the tension between China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is a sign of peace for South-East Asia, for if these two great countries are in conflict how are they going to combine to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> South-East Asia in a communist campaign? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some instances, even if the grants do comply with the structural adjustment legislation, they clearly <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the recommendations of 2 other Government instrumentalities- the Industries Assistance Commission and the Temporary Assistance Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not unnaturally it suits the Government to make  Mr Souter  the scapegoat for this attempt to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the announced Government policy on crude oil purchases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is just as logical for me to say that what he is putting forward is that he is seeking to make it harder, that he is seeking to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the democratic process, that he does not really want an expression of majority rule, that he wants a manipulated result whereby the Opposition parties can scramble back into government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>the continuing incompetence, evasion, deceit and duplicity of the Prime Minister and his Ministers as exemplified in the overseas loan scandal which was an attempt by the Government to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the Constitution, to bypass Parliament and to evade its responsibilities to the States and the Loan Council; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the name of political expediency, Opposition members are prepared to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the very constitutional framework that they claim to be seeking to preserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government has acted against the Constitution, as it did last year, and is seeking to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the Constitution now, seeking to go against the opinion of that learned judge  Mr Justice  Murphy and that learned Q.C. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Deputy  Prime Minister’s statements when he addressed the National Press Club and when he launched the book  Uranium on Trial  gave the clearest indication of the staggering extent to which he fails to understand the significance of the uranium question and has sought to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the findings of the Fox Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course there will be a divergence of view but there must be a continuing sensitivity to the political climate, the political view, to ensure that our political establishment can be provided with the opportunity to go about its business without any undue stress or pressure from instrumentalities or devices which may be established which would <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the functioning of democratic parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I had no support from any substantial section of the trade union movement anywhere in Australia, from either right, left or centre, because the trade union movement saw it as being a foul capitalist plot to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> its future leadership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But on the face of it, especially in relation to the third point on this page- that a public commitment is required of companies to increase Australian equity to 51 per cent- the Opposition feels concerned that the objectives set could be subverted by a company dragging its feet and that we might evolve a never-never sort of system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The union movement, and particularly those unions that are communist-dominated, already have started a process of rolling strikes to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the Government’s policy, to prevent a recovery being brought about by this Budget and to disrupt economic recovery in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780817_reps_31_hor110/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a great shame for these people that the people of Australia are perceptive enough to identify what they are all about and were perceptive enough last December to see that these communist dominated left wing unions are purposely subverting Australia, as a result of which the Government parties were returned with their majority in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780817_reps_31_hor110/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the people of Australia will be equally perceptive and will identify that the thrust of this Budget is purposefully to bring about economic recovery in this country and that those people who purposely engage in strike action, bans and limitations to <span class="highlight">subvert</span> the Budget are doing so for purely political reasons, to undermine the structure and the basis of the economy of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780817_reps_31_hor110/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
