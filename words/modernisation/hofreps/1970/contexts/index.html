<ul>
  <li>
    <p>-The Minister for Defence will be aware that the re-equipment, remodelling and <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of HMAS  Perth  has made it entirely different from its former sister ships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister indicate whether <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> and maintenance of essential defence equipment has been postponed by the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, will he state whether the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> programs for the 2 guided missile destroyers HMAS  Hobart  and HMAS  Brisbane  which were to be given half life refits this year at Garden Island, has been postponed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, in accordance with the  Public Works Committee Act  1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: HMA Naval Dockyard, Williamstown, Vic- <span class="highlight">Modernisation</span> of facilities, stage 2. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would have been no need for the recipts tax if the national Government had established a hospitals commission to assist in the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> and regionalisation of hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot wait 5. years for yet another agreement; happily we need only await a new government which will take those initiatives required to begin the task of <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the ramshackle structure of finances and functions which bear so heavily on the people for so inadequate a return. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700609_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am pleased to note the continuing <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of our three Services under this Government and, in particular, the decision to expedite the building of a naval base at Cockburn Sound, together with the upgrading of the RAAF complex at Exmouth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Feasibility studies indicate that the installation of some part, perhaps to be followed by a secondary stage in the next 6 to 12 months, may be necessary, lt is quite unfair to remove at this stage this carrot which has been there to encourage <span class="highlight">modernisation</span>.. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710223_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will set up an Australian Hospitals Commission to promote the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> and regionalisation of hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will set up an Australian Hospitals Commission to promote the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> and regionalisation of hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as will prevent the honourable member for Hindmarsh moving a motion for the establishment of a select committee to inquire into and report upon proposals made by employees and employers organisations and other interested parties for the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the Commonwealth’s industrial laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to second the motion, so ably proposed by the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  for the suspension of the Standing Orders so that a motion can be moved for the establishment of a select committee to inquire into and report upon proposals made by employers and employee organisations and other interested parties for the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the Commonwealth industrial laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Hindmarsh moving a motion for the establishment of a select committee to inquire into and report upon proposals made by employees’ and employers’ organisations and other interested parties for the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the Commonwealth’s industrial laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of Sydney (KingsfordSmith) Airport in its present form took place over the 10 years 1946-1955. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-55-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Modernisation</span> of books and forms used by police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-51-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it could be fairly agreed that the 4.4 per cent increase in manufacturing industry was not excessive, but that in fact there is a case for more stimulus to manufacturing, to encourage <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of equipment and improvements in efficiency and productivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can aim to offset the high labour costs by striving for more <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> and sophistication, more innovation and specialisation and, above all, more productivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the woollen textile industry there is no encouragement for <span class="highlight">modernisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The key point is to ensure that in the process of <span class="highlight">modernisation</span>, dis cipline and individual efficiency are maintained at the level necessary to ensure operational efficiency in the event of war and to prevent the lives of Australian soldiers being endangered unnecessarily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Defence Review has pointed to the expansion of China’s conventional naval and air forces and to the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of all three of the Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the keys to this <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> process lies in the pre-sale objective measurement of wool and the sale of wool by sample. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> and updating of the Charles F. Adams DDG guided missile destroyers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should have been told that by 1975 a firm foundation would have been laid for a national highway system and for the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the urban transport system; that by 1975 the endless sprawl of the capitals will have been reversed and that our countryside will begin to be taking a new shape with the building up of new and existing centres; that by 1975 the Australian national Government shall have moved decisively on behalf of the Australian people to regain control of the ownership and use of Australia’s resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am prompted to do so by the question which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked of the Minister for Defence concerning the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the military code, one of the obstacles to which hitherto has been the death penalty in some of the incorporated legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to my belief that this Act should provide the funds to enable the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of older accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should determine a real sense of priority about them and decide whether any of them are to be subjected to a <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was not opposed in any way to the rebuilding or <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the College. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since its inception in November 1961, additional capital of some $5m has been made available to the Commission by the Commonwealth to facilitate capital replacement, <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> and expansion programmes at the Laboratories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-34-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether honourable members on the opposite side know that many years ago the international organisation which was considering mechanisation and its effects unanimously decided that shorter working hours would be the answer to mechanisation and <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> because if the work force was to be fully employed this was the method it should use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Newcastle State Dockyard needs <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> improvements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has undertaken a reorganisation and <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the administration of the Defence Group of Departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730227_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Country Party want to see progress in the development and <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of better housing in the great capita] cities of Australia, but we have a responsibility and a duty to ensure that the needs of the rural areas of this country are not overlooked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Technical advice is constantly provided in various countries on mill re-organisation and <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> and the specialised treatments and processes such as for permanent creasing, shrink proofing and machine washability of wool products, are being extended under trade mark and licence control, by the IWS, in the various countries where it operates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Modernisation</span> of HMA Naval Dockyard (Stage 1) Williamstown, Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A decision was taken by the previous Government to proceed with the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the 3 Charles F. Adams class guided missile destroyers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will cover the overhaul and <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the S-inch guns; updating the Tartar missile system to enable it to use the more advanced Standard missile; and installation of a computerised automated command and control system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, and in line with maintaining our existing destroyers as operationally effective fleet units, it is the Government’s intention to proceed with the refit and <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of some, at least, of the older River class destroyers during the latter half of this decade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extensive <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of our 3 Charles F. Adams class destroyers was to have been carried out in United States dockyards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have directed that ways be developed to do at least two of these modernisations in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recent decision of the Labor Government has resulted in $6.5m being allocated to the updating and <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of Brisbane airport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately - and this is one thing that makes me extremely sad - the people of Cribb Island and Nudgee Beach who can least afford to be disturbed and removed from their homes are the ones who will be suffering because of the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the Brisbane airport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am particularly interested in this development as it affects the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> and updating of the Brisbane airport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen in the first instance the honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron)  again in this Parliament endeavouring to indicate not only to us but also to the people of Queensland that he has a vast and intense interest in the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of Brisbane Airport and the effects of operations at Brisbane Airport on people in the surrounding areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from that, involved in the DDL program was the expenditure of quite large sums of money on reequipping the Williamstown dockyard and other essential changes in the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of our dockyards to enable the personnel to cope with the latest construction methods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has committed itself to a policy of promoting the regionalisation and <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of hospitals, linked with the development of community based health services and preventive health programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reviewing laws to which this Act applies, the Commission will have in view systematic development and reform of the law, including, in particular the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the law, the elimination of defects in the law, the simplification of the law, and the adoption of new or more effective methods for the administration of the law and the dispensation of justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allied to that, of course, are our Standing Orders which I think it has to be agreed could do with a <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> in many respects to cut out - not to short circuit - many of the time consuming practices that are involved and which probably could be brought more into line with modern day thinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He dedicated himself to the advancement of his country, whether through the propagation of the French tongue, <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the economic and social conditions of French life, or in directing personally the conduct of France’s international diplomacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is because of the normal program of ship and submarine refits, the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of 4 River class destroyers recently approved, the construction of guided missile destroyers, the construction of the oceanographic ship also recently approved, the planned extended refit to HMAS ‘Melbourne’, and other possible work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another project being carried out for use in the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the River Class Destroyers which I announced last year is the development of a much improved active sonar system known as Mulloka. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This year also the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of dockyard facilities at Williamstown has commenced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>China obviously, because of the dimensions of its market, offers one of the most exciting prospects on earth now that it has embarked upon a course of <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> which will in time lift its living standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>And one of the key countries, Iran, had experienced significant economic growth and <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> before its current troubles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the extent that China, if left alone and unprovoked, would prefer peace and stability at this stage of its development in order to concentrate on internal <span class="highlight">modernisation</span>, and only to that extent, there is a convergence between its present interest and ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That act makes mandatory: the setting up and equipping of new sports facilities as well as the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> and maintenance of existing ones the provision of sport equipment and sports wear for athletes the initial training and further training of sports teachers and doctors the guarantee of all-out medical care for children and youth engaging in activities by the sport-medical service of the GDR the gathering and application of scientific findings to the teaching programs, training programs and compilation of efficiency criteria and norms for children’s and youth sport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Power conflicts certainly feed upon these economic contrasts and from the traumas of economic <span class="highlight">modernisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Capital goods were required, <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> was required, a price system was being talked about, a capacity to export was being talked about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is not an argument against <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of industry or the principles of export incentives and long term controlled reductions in tariffs on selected imports as advocated in the Crawford report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The question she was asked, which was not reported in the Press, was: As China is having difficulty with respect to the payment of her overseas loans and overseas trade, what arrangements does she intend to make in relation to her <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> program? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I suggest that a statement should be made setting out the conditions of trade between Australia and China as part of her <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I suggest that a statement ought to be made by the Minister for Trade and Resources  (Mr Anthony)  and the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  setting out the terms of trade between Australia and China as dictated by China’s lack of foreign exchange appropriate to the amount of trade that she desires for her <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The British Minister,  Mr Varley,  who has recently been in China, will issue a statement on the nature of Britain’s trading agreement with China in view of the fact that Australia has played a leading part in encouraging and in helping the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> program in China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The overall <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of Garden Island Dockyard in Sydney is part of the program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1970 when the present Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  was the Minister for Defence he announced a program of defence procurements which included a light destroyer patrol, 84 observation helicopters, 42 utility helicopters, 1 1 vertical take-off and landing aircraft, four support helicopters, a naval communications station at Darwin, the overhaul and <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of gun mounts on guided missile destroyers, two Oberon class submarines, six low cover radars, one logistic cargo ship for the Army, 10 additional Skyhawks for the Navy and two twin engine support and training aircraft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-33-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The overhaul and <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of gun mounts was transferred to Australian industry by the Labor Government when in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-33-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It did not indicate significantly any timetable or real plans for the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the F-111 aircraft to bring about a full use of the potential that the aircraft has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-33-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This increase reflects a number of factors, among them the capital requirements for <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> and growth in industry and the likelihood of a shift in the pattern of production towards resource-based export activities and other more capital intensive industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The need for <span class="highlight">modernisation</span>, new technology and new plant is involved in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having accepted the recommendations of the Norgard inquiry and as part of the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> and upgrading of the Commonwealth Employment Service, the Government has increased the staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I returned from China last year I made the comment that if China’s <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> program were to succeed it would need the support of the mass of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out that to gain that support of the people it was terribly important that that <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> program express itself in the agricultural sector where the great bulk of the people are engaged and also that it meet some of their enormous food requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in the area of agricultural <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> that Australia can play a significant role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One has returned and prepared a very good report on the development and <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of a sugar industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The new arrangements for marketing Commonwealth securities represent essentially a <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of procedures in relation to the issue of Commonwealth securities in line with developments in capital markets which have become increasingly sophisticated since existing methods of marketing treasury bonds and treasury notes were introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Has his attention been drawn to the statements made by Chinese Vice Premier Madame Chen Muhua at the National Press Club that China’s trade in its <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> program will follow practices such as (a) compensatory payments, which she defined as being payments with the products of the enterprises and (b) delaying payments for equipment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790821_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-116-9">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Summers report highlighted the need for <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of existing legislation and one can appreciate how that is absolutely vital when one considers that after almost 80 years as a federation our shipping industry has been regulated largely by British legislation drawn up for the purpose of a nineteenth century colonial empire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-We know that the investment policies of this Government have been a very important factor in increasing the competitiveness of Australian industry through greater efficiency because of <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of plant and equipment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The regulation of transport by individual States has contributed to the distortion of the national transport system in favour of parochial State interests and delaying much needed <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> and reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to the changes outlined in my statement concerning Army supply warehousing these fall into two broad categories; a concentration of storeholding facilities in fewer locations and a <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the remaining facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-73-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>In regard to the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of facilities, as these proposals are developed consultation with the unions will take place in accordance with the guidelines on technological change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-73-23">[More…]</a></li>
