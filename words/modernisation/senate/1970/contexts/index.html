    <p>1 ) Did the Managing Director of Connair Pty Ltd state recently that, because of lack of financial support from the Government and the airline’s inability to obtain departmental agreement to the re-equipping and <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> ofthe airline, he must close the airline on 30 September 1977 to prevent further loss. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I  regard the last suggestion by  Senator Murphy  as most curious, particularly coming from the leader of a party which has constantly urged that there should be a <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the law, because what would be involved in that suggestion is the repeal of one clause of an up to date crimes ordinance with a view to bringing back into force provisions of the Crimes Act of 1900. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Against the $4.25m made available for the Bell Bay link, the Federal Government provided more than $244m to other States for railway <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> and construction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was nothing but a subsidy made by the Government or by the people of Australia to encourage industry to invest in the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of its equipment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> was of great value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those rules are effective, although they may be in need of greater perfection and greater <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> or greater ease of application. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That was like looking at the back half of the moon, for what  Senator Bishop  failed to say - this was agreed by honourable senators on both sides - was that a group of employees was facing massive retrenchment as a result of massive <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> and massive mechanisation of their industry, and that the Act was designed specifically to protect them against others coming in and taking their jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thai in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969-1972, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary, Standing COmmitte on Public Works for investigation and report: <span class="highlight">Modernisation</span> of HMA Naval Dockyard, Williamstown, Victoria (Stage 1). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposed work involves <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of existing facilities and the construction of new facilities necessary to allow the construction and launching of a bare hull. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A decision was taken by the previous Government to proceed with the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the 3 Charles F. Adams class guided missile destroyers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will cover the overhaul and <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the 5-inch guns; updating the Tartar missile system to enable it to use the more advanced Standard missile; and installation of a computerised automated command -and control system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, and in line wilh maintaining our existing destroyers as ope’;, tionally effective fleet units, it is the Government’s intention to proceed with the refit arc <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of some, at least, of the older River class destroyers during the latter half of this decade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In reviewing laws to which this Act applies, the Commission will have in view systematic development and reform of the law, including, in particular: the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the law; the elimination of defects in the law; the simplification of the law; and the adoption of new or more effectivemethods for the administration of the law andthe dispensation of justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister acknowledge that the Labor Government has proposed and is introducing significant changes to the income tax structure so as to withdraw from farmers benefits which previously encouraged <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of equipment, conservation of fodder and water, and productivity? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think most of them need drastic <span class="highlight">modernisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what they mostly need is <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> in regard to the protection of rights, not an extension of ministerial discretions with which this mining code is simply shot through from one end to the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This objective is expressed to include <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the law to bring it into accord with modern conditions, the elimination of defects in the law, the simplification of the law and the adoption of new or more effective methods for the administration of the law and the dispensation of justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the Hume Highway? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has committed itself to a policy of promoting the regionalisation and <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of hospitals, linked with the development of community based health services and preventive health programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The upgrading and the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the present health scheme is required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Council has been told, however, that in any <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> scheme which is under consideration environmental factors will be given great consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Other matters on the defence procurement list were 10 Westland cargo helicopters, the oceanographic ship, additional Oberon class submarines, the refit of Oberon class submarines, the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of River class destroyers, extra gun mountings and the DDG ship improvement and refit program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He dedicated himself to the advancement of his country, whether through the propagation of the French language, through the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the economic and social conditions of life in France, or in directing personally the conduct of France’s international diplomacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is because of the normal program of ship and submarine refits, the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of 4 River class destroyers recently approved, the update of guided missile destroyers, the construction of the oceanographic ship also recently approved, the planned extended refit to HMAS ‘Melbourne’; and other possible work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another project being carried out for use in the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the River class destroyers which I announced last year is the development of a much improved active sonar system known as Mulloka. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This year also the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of dockyard facilities at Williamstown has commenced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He stated in an address to a formal dinner of the Chamber of Manufactures: ‘The facts remain today that the true party of competition, of <span class="highlight">modernisation</span>, of freer trade, even perhaps of free enterprise in its most genuine sense, is the Labor Party.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard many senators from all sides of this House suggest that the time has arrived for some <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of our parliamentary system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are asking for a fresh look at it in order to bring about, we hope, a rationalisation or a <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the system which exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We heard the Leader of the Opposition talk about hospitals and the need for the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) The <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of HMAS Perth commenced on 3 September 1974 at Long Beach Naval Shipyard, Long Beach, California, U.S.A. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The estimated total cost of the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> i.e. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> cost for HMAS Hobart and HMAS Brisbane is expected to be in the order of $A 7.7m for HMAS Brisbane and $A7.7m for HMAS Hobart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These modernisations have not yet started. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The above costs include overheads in order to establish a valid comparison with the cost of HMAS Perth’s <span class="highlight">modernisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having made those remarks, I repeat what I said earlier: The time has come when we have to look at the question of introducing some <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of dress in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the quarantine station will lead to the consolidation of the quarantine activities of the Department of Health to about 10 acres of the 140 acres now occupied by the station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, through the urban transport program the Government has contributed substantially to the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of State urban railways in such fields as track duplication, improved signalling and passenger rolling stock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am the first one to applaud any <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the superannuation scheme and I join  Senator Wright  in his commendation of those aspects of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Opposition is saying that it agrees to the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the administration of the scheme and to the new scheme competing for a while with the old scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The DDL Program has lost its momentum and the development of a detailed design together with the substantial workload and facilities <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> program of the Williamstown Dockyard would not permit des.toyer construction to commence in Australia until 1980. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a time when we are looking towards the updating and <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of our naval, military and air forces, which as I have said have been allowed to deteriorate, it would serve us well to consider seriously the advantages of the establishment of defence facilities along our northern coastline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a great need for port <span class="highlight">modernisation</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said before, one hopes that one will see the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of ports with amenities and facilities which will enable a quicker turn around of ships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, this motion which was put on the Senate Notice Paper by me on the second day of sitting of this Parliament is a continuation of the fight the Labor movement is waging for reform, or if you like, <span class="highlight">modernisation</span>- a bringing up to date- of the Australian electoral system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his second reading speech the Minister was somewhat critical of the delay that has taken place in the implementation of the arrangements that were being made and that were originally announced by the McMahon Government in 1971 for the updating, or the <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> or the bringing forward of the resettlement program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a question of trying to work out what has happened to that capital, why it has not been applied to <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of manufacturing industry and why it is now leaving Australia in great quantities and finding its place in the cheap labour centres of Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, the Philippines and Singapore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This points to a lack of efficient plant, to a lack of <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of the enterprise and perhaps to too diversified a siting of the various plants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Within the ‘new states’ frequently born ‘from the meagre remains of an exhausted colonial regime’, that same crisis of confidence is expressed in the collapse of the old ‘ nationalist ‘ appeal-of <span class="highlight">modernisation</span>, high-level, capital-intensive technology, of Gross National Product and the ‘ take-off mentality of the sixties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To the extent that China if left alone and unprovoked, would prefer peace and stability at this stage of its development in order to concentrate on internal <span class="highlight">modernisation</span>, and only to that extent, there is a convergence between its present interest and ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to a report that Bradmill Industries Ltd is taking a commercial risk by engaging in a $30m <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> program based on the assumption- according to the chief executive of Bradmill- that no government will substantially reduce protection of the textile industry by 1980 which is the end of the three-year protection guarantee period? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The new arrangements for marketing Commonwealth securities represent essentially a <span class="highlight">modernisation</span> of procedures in relation to the issue of Commonwealth securities in line with developments in capital markets which have become increasingly sophisticated since existing methods of marketing Treasury bonds and Treasury notes were introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
