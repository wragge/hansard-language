<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It can be very frightening to feel totally <span class="highlight">powerless</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Local governments virtually are <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to provide the services which obviously should be provided for the people unfortunate enough to have thrust upon them th: task of rearing families in high rise flats or, for that matter, those passing their declining years in high rise flats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If local government bodies are <span class="highlight">powerless</span> in these matters, as they arc tending to become, we can expect the public to be apathetic about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian export industries are <span class="highlight">powerless</span> at present against the cancerous-like increases in costs which are destroying the economic heart of the once vital major rural industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An individual employer is <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to respond. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>As the Constitution stands at the moment this Parliament is virtually <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to take any action in respect of companies, unless of course a company is incorporated in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The company is virtually <span class="highlight">powerless</span> unless it can get someone to lend it money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it continued for any length of time, this rate of inflation would be quite unacceptable - not just to the Government with economic responsibility to maintain balanced growth and development, but to large sections of the community who are <span class="highlight">powerless</span> in the redistribution of income, wages, and assets which is the social vice of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The one sector of the community that is utterly <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to pass on this cost is the producer for export who must sell overseas with no relationship to his own cost of production but in competition with other sellers of the same products on the same market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that they have accepted what they were <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to reject is merely evidence of the truth of the old saying that half a loaf is better than none at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Film Censorship Board may put a suitable for adults only’ label on a film, but the theatres, the police and the States are <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to make that restriction operate legally at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710223_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the public once again made the victim in a needless, costly strike which should not have occurred and which was one of a series of incidents in which the unions have proved <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to discipline their own members? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new Minister for Health  (Senator Greenwood)  enters today into negotiations with Australia’s toughest trade union having conceded in advance that its claims are reasonable and that the Government is <span class="highlight">powerless</span> in any case to resist those claims even if it felt justified in doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who are <span class="highlight">powerless</span> enjoy few of the fruits when they are abundant and are denied proportionately more when they are scarce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But how insignificant we feel as individuals when we are confronted with computerised accounts based on the automatic readings of little black boxes, and how <span class="highlight">powerless</span> we feel we are to challenge the accuracy of  those transistorised  robots with which we are forced to deal! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711110_reps_27_hor75/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only do we feel <span class="highlight">powerless</span>, but we are made to feel impotent by the ready assumption of the Post Office bureaucracy that if there are any difficulties about Post Office accounts, the computer must be right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711110_reps_27_hor75/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While it is not particularly human for one section to satisfy its vanities at the expense of those who are <span class="highlight">powerless</span>, it is disgusting that politicians, who by definition are people oriented should permit them to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the people were <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to react against it themselves because they did not see the implications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Citizens are virtually <span class="highlight">powerless</span> and unprotected against government decisions which lead to their discomfort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view the Commissioner will be virtually <span class="highlight">powerless</span>, under the terms of this Bill, to act in the critical areas of pay rates and conditions of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, having voluntarily relinquished effective control of immigration, a government which implemented Labor’s immigration policies would be largely <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to redress the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was stated that the original Bill setting up the Australian Wool Commission had no teeth and was <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to do anything. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find that the authority is <span class="highlight">powerless</span>; that it is nothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot tolerate the fact that government is by the Federal Conference of the ALP - not elected, not responsible to the people of Australia - while the elected representatives are <span class="highlight">powerless</span> against its dictates and must wait on its decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the absence of the strike weapon the worker is <span class="highlight">powerless</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must never accept the proposition that we must get used to political terrorism, involving bombings, murder, intimidation and that democratic governments are <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to suppress such activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be eradicated from their minds because it is the very people who are going to be harmed by inflation who are economically <span class="highlight">powerless</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the economically <span class="highlight">powerless</span> who elected this Government to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in such industries that the col lective bargaining power of the employee is important; otherwise he is <span class="highlight">powerless</span> as an individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Money, of course, is the major power and there is no doubt that with the power of money vested in the Commonwealth the States will be completely <span class="highlight">powerless</span> and impotent to exercise any authority whatever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, if employers and employees agree on wage increases, as they have increasingly done in collective bargaining, the Commission is <span class="highlight">powerless</span>, except by refusing to register or certify such agreements or endorse them as awards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But she is <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to do anything about the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aggression is occuring in South East Asia on a massive scale against South Vietnam and Cambodia, and we still stand <span class="highlight">powerless</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In IS of the 72 cases the Commonwealth was <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to act under the legislation; in 21 of the 72 cases the takeover proceeded after the order had either been revoked or lapsed; 14 of the 72 were still under review; and 13 of the 72 cases that attracted the interim order were prohibited from takeover outright. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why when people in our community today - a modern bureaucratic society - feel increasingly <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to make decisions that affect their own lives and when people feel distant from the decision making in society, they would take away decision making in this area is almost beyond belief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it comes to action the United Nations is not only shown to be <span class="highlight">powerless</span> but is acknowledged by this Government to be <span class="highlight">powerless</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that the decision of last week to give the ACT an enlarged assembly of 18 elected people with no legislative powers initially merely means that a <span class="highlight">powerless</span> body of 8 elected members is being replaced by an equally <span class="highlight">powerless</span> body of 18 elected members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate destroyed that Bill by agreeing to that amendment, because it realised that without the mining code the declaratory Part I of the Seas and Submerged Lands Bill was <span class="highlight">powerless</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, because of the lack of any direct controls over the fringe banks, the Government was quite <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to do anything about the hire purchase companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But under the regulations the Postmaster-General is <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to waive these charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One might argue that the poor, being socially and economically <span class="highlight">powerless</span>, need extra political representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the argument which is being belted up by the Prime Minister and by the Minister for the Media that the Board is <span class="highlight">powerless</span> is an argument which is not merely unattractive; it is an argument which has no substance in it whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On behalf of the Opposition I will move to amend clause 19 to ensure that there is Commonwealth and State co-operation in such a program and to ensure that the States are not rendered <span class="highlight">powerless</span> in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition senatorsI certainly do not blame the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  for their conduct for he is <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to control them- are not just attacking the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He drew attention then to the fact that members of the public had been induced by false rumours to buy shares, that inside trading was rife and that selfregulatory bodies seemed either <span class="highlight">powerless</span> or unwilling to act to protect the public against this and the many other market abuses that were prevalent at the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can see that it is a letter of a conscientious but <span class="highlight">powerless</span> man pleading for cooperation from the jumpers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An approach was made by the Student Counsellor at the Methodist Ladies College to a  Mr Bert  Miles, who is concerned with overseas students at the Department of Education, and  Mr Miles  has stated that he was <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to help in any way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the name of equality is the court to be <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to consider each case on its merits? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we continue to unify by the back door we will end up with an uncertain legal position and with a tortuous and inefficient administrative chain still involving what will have become a <span class="highlight">powerless</span> and embittered State organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He just has to sit back and watch people in every other sector of the community protecting themselves, with varying degrees of success, against inflation- and often making inflation worse in the process- while he is <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to do anything to protect himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I may put it in a homely way, if a seaman should tell the chief petty officer to go to Bourke, and tender further advice to him, the chief petty officer is not left in some <span class="highlight">powerless</span>, hapless state of mind unable to rectify the blemish of conduct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The disgraceful situation we have now in respect of the Governor-General of Australia is that every Government in the future will live in fear and trembling about the powers that the Governor-General has at his disposal, knowing that we have a monarch who has said that she is <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to intervene and do anything about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw attention to the report by the Trade Practices Commission that it is <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to deal with unions which engage in illegal trading activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, whether it be in a matter as trivial as the refusal to issue certificates of decrees of divorce, as required by Federal legislation, or as important as the prompt and efficient dispatch of litigation under the Trade Practices Act, the Federal government is <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to intervene in the administration of State courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One would think that it was not the Government making these accusations because it appears to be <span class="highlight">powerless</span> now and unable to do anythingunable even to pay this man’s debt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Such a policy took from those prepared to work, risk and invest and created a new class of dependent drones- of which I see one or two examples here tonight- and a bloated bureaucracy without giving any substantial help to the really poor and <span class="highlight">powerless</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister completely <span class="highlight">powerless</span> in this matter, as  Dr Davis  and PSI appear to think? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is by no means an exhaustive treatment but provides some insight into Labor’s thinking at a time when the Fraser Government seems increasingly bewildered and <span class="highlight">powerless</span>, and the return of a Labor Government increasingly likely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those who favour the withdrawal of the Government from the industry use the argument that the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority has been <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to intervene and should be abolished because it is just a useless anachronism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the banner of choice, power and freedom, the so-called fundamental belief of the Government, more Australians are denied economic freedom and the right to work and are rendered unproductive and <span class="highlight">powerless</span> as unemployment is deliberately increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party can get away with that only if it creates a situation in which the States become so weak, so mendicant, so <span class="highlight">powerless</span> and so subservient that they can do nothing about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, if the Northern Territory environment is damaged to an unexpected extent or in an unforseen way by uranium mining at Ranger then the Commonwealth would be <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to improve the relevant environment protection conditions laid down in association with the authority to mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thus, the <span class="highlight">powerless</span> victims of the crisis have somehow come to stand accused of having created their own unemployment- a twist of logic which represents a classic example of blaming the victim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst the efforts of the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission are heroic, it is <span class="highlight">powerless</span> to purchase land when certain vested State government, mining or pastoral interests would prefer to keep that land within what they call sound land use planning guidelines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He drew attention then to the fact that members of the public had been induced by false rumours to buy shares, that insider trading was rife and that selfregulative bodies seemed either <span class="highlight">powerless</span> or unwilling to act to protect the public against those market abuses and the many other market abuses that were prevalent at the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
