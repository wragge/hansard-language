    <p>Australian exports to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in this period were as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What was the value of (a) imports from and (b) exports to (i) ail Asian countries, (ii) all Asian countries excluding Japan and (iii) all Asian countries excluding Japan and Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> for the latest year for which information is available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-33-7">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I can only inform the honourable member that we have had no blandishments seeking to induce us to recognise Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> and that the policy of this Government on that matter remains as it always has been and I am sure it is clearly understood to be by the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: Can he give the House a specific assurance that he has resisted the blandishments of any persuasive visitors to recognise Red <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Prime Minister noticed reports that Malaysia’s new Prime Minister, Tun Abdul Razak, has called for the neutralisation of South East Asia with guarantees from the Soviet Union, <span class="highlight">China</span> and the United States of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700923_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What validity is there is Australia’s forward defence policy of containing Communism, which is based on the alignment of Malaysia against Communism and therefore against the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and <span class="highlight">China</span>, especially when Malaysia is seeking guarantees from these  2  Communist powers for its own future? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700923_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To what extent has the Canadian Prime Minister been in touch with him regarding the Canadian proposal to admit Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> applied for admission to the United Nations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Department of External Affairs has been in touch with our Department, keeping it, in genera], informed of the progress of discussions between the Canadian Government and the Government of Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the Minister reconcile his statement on 14th October to the Leader of the Opposition that Malaysia will abstain, from a vote on the actual recognition of - Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, with his reference given today to Tun Ismail’s statement that Malaysia would, if necessary, cosponsor any move to admit <span class="highlight">China</span> .to the United Nations by a simple majority? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for External Affairs will recall that in answer to a question yesterday he said that his information was that there was a possibility of a change in the attitude of Malaysia towards the admission of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister inform the House what, so far as he knows, is the present attitude of the Malaysian Government towards the admission of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations and its present attitude towards Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> generally? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it the view of the Malaysian Government that the question of the admission of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations should be determined by a simple majority vote at the United Nations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is Malaysia willing to co-sponsor a resolution recommending the admission of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Brazil, Central African Republic, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Iran, Liberia, Libya, Malawi, Morocco, New Zealand, Niger, Nigeria, Portugal, Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, Tunisia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he inform me, as ,be Acting Minister promised on 30 September (Hansard, page 1861) whether iron and steel are on the list of strategic materials which Western countries, including Australia and Japan, have agreed not to export to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are (a) iron (b) steel and (c) zinc among the strategic materials which the NATO powers and Japan have agreed not to export to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Which countries have extended diplomatic recognition to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and when did they do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-37-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What countries have taken steps to extend diplomatic recognition to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> since his answer to me on 28th October 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, Nigeria has now announced that it recognises ‘the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> as the sole legal Government representing the entire Chinese people’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What were the texts of resolutions moved during 1969 and 1970 in the various organs of the United Nations concerning representation of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710223_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the question of the export of strategic materials to <span class="highlight">China</span> been referred to Cabinet since his answer to me on 28th October 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710225_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-26-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not, however, want to enter into a full scale debate on wheat growing and primary production and the advisability or otherwise of recognising Red <span class="highlight">China</span> and all those other matters that have been raised and have nothing to do with the legislation before us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall therefore confine my statement to four questions of particular current interest and importance to Australia - Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Middle East and Pakistan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Noone in this Parliament, no-one in Australia and certainly no wheat grower will be satisfied with the attempt of the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  to downgrade the importance of the present crisis in the Australian-Chinese wheat trade and, generally, in trade relations between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, as some members opposite have said, this debate is concerned with sales of wheat to Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Prime Minister heard of the intention of a prominent journalist and of others to visit mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> in connection with certain sporting activities and of a member of the Opposition of this House to pay a visit to inquire into trade negotiations by this Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does his Government still maintain, as is stated in the credentials of Australia’s ambassador to Taipeh, that the government of Taiwan <span class="highlight">China</span>, to adopt his term, is the legitimate and actual government of all and every <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government officially maintain that Taiwan <span class="highlight">China</span> is responsible not only for the 14 million people on the island of Taiwan but for the population 50 times that size in continental <span class="highlight">China</span> as well? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think there are any magical results from recognition or nonrecognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is now asserting, without any hope of using it as an ideological weapon to change the facts on the mainland of <span class="highlight">China</span>, that the Government on Taiwan is the Government of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Entry of <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations will not be determined by our recognition or by American recognition, just as Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> has never got into the United Nations on British recognition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of recognition is only a matter of trying to have a contact with <span class="highlight">China</span> as one step towards the development of a sane world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To hear members speak one would imagine that we already had diplomatic relations with Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each and every one of the speeches that were made tonight could have been a speech of an ambassador from Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that they have done tonight has been to stand up one after another and defend Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does Australia discriminate against imports from mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When will the Minister announce, as forecast by the Prime Minister on 20th April, measures to liberalise our trade with mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has a table tennis team from the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> ever been refused an entry permit to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-51-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that Pakistan is a member of SEATO it is known that she has undertakings from <span class="highlight">China</span> for support in any such confrontation which would make for a very difficult international situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On what date did he receive (a) the cable from Hong Kong and (b) the record of a conversation between British and Australian officials concerning the purchase of Australia wheat by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> (Hansard, 7th April 1971, page 1557)? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-30-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has his attention been drawn to a report in “The Australian’ of 7th April 1971 that a Government spokesman said after question time the previous day that the Prime Minister had given a very high security classification to the communication received through the British Government on the sale of Australian wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-30-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member knows, the Australian Government maintains diplomatic relations with, and of course recognises, the Government of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-30-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is not required, however, to take any stand with regard to the territorial claims maintained by the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, or for that matter by other governments which it recognises and with which it is in diplomatic relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-30-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No useful purpose would be served by attempting the academic exercise of specifying those administrative divisions referred to generically by the honourable member as ‘the provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of <span class="highlight">China</span>’ in which the Government considers that one or other of the three categories of governmental authority mentioned by the honourable member is exercised by cither the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> or the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-30-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over what provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of <span class="highlight">China</span> does the Australian Government consider that (a) the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and (b) the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> has (i) de facto sovereignty, (ii) de jure sovereignty, and (iii) actual control? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-30-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In line with other Western countries, Australia operates controls to prevent the export of strategic materials to Communist countries, including the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However it does not obstruct purchases made from Australia of items, such as certain metals, which are not on the list of strategic materials and are, therefore freely available to <span class="highlight">China</span> from elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Preliminary figures for the export of metals to <span class="highlight">China</span> for 1970.71 are as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are Australian metal exports to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> suitable for use in producing armaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, before opening negotiations with <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Government knew from the publicly expressed attitudes of both <span class="highlight">China</span> and the authorities in Taipei that it would not be possible for Australia to establish diplomatic relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> while retaining an Embassy in Taipei. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Minister state, as reported, that a wool mission from <span class="highlight">China</span> had placed an initial order with the Australian Wool Corporation for about 1,000 bales of merino wool valued at $500,000, and that this was an important breakthrough in respect of trade between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Seriously,  Mr Speaker,  I did raise with the Chinese authorities the possibility of a visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> by an Australian Rules football team. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the facilities that are available in <span class="highlight">China</span> for visitors from other countries at the present time are very limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason alone it is physically not possible for the Chinese Government to agree to many of the requests that are made by people to visit <span class="highlight">China</span> for medical reasons or for reasons such as this one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Chinese authorities have pointed out that the game is not known in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned to assist Australian Rules football to become more widely known, especially in Australia, and I look forward to the possibility of a visit by such a team to <span class="highlight">China</span> sooner or later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a fellow Victorian who also enjoys Australian Rules football, I ask: What is the reason that the Peoples’ Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> has declined the Minister’s proposal, for which I commend him, of a visit to that country by an Australian Rules football team? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the  Mr Douglas  Darby referred to in the article as  President  of the ‘Australia-Free <span class="highlight">China</span> Society’ the same  Mr Darby  who was  Chairman  of the Cricket for Free <span class="highlight">China</span> Committee in 1970 (Hansard, 26 October 1971, pages 2559-60). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-40-6">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With reference to the Government’s decision not to supply Nomad aircraft to Portugal consistent with  its support for the United Nations Resolution 2918 of 14 November 1972, is it a fact that the Government is negotiating a sale of Nomad aircraft to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>and (3) Formal diplomatic channels, not a direct approach from me to  Chairman  Mao (who is  Chairman  of the Chinese Communist Party and not, as the honourable member erroneously stated on 23 October 1973,  Chairman  of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>), would be the appropriate way to arrange a visit by an Australian Parliamentary delegation to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-51-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present Prime Minister drew attention to such a communication on 6 April 1971  (Hansard,page  1462) when asking the then Prime Minister to confirm that the Chinese Government had indicated that it would not buy further supplies of Australian wheat because of a statement made by a Minister of the former Australian Government, which <span class="highlight">China</span> considered to be hostile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Chifley  (Mr Armitage)  alleged- and it was confessed to by the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)-  that in the mid-1960s the honourable member for Mackellar suggested to this House that nuclear bombs should be dropped on certain factories in mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yes, when <span class="highlight">China</span> did not have nuclear bombs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was sitting in the Parliament on that night and I was appalled that the honourable member for Mackellar should suggest dropping nuclear weapons on certain factories in the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I am concerned, the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> has vehemently declared to the world time and time again that she will never be the first to use nuclear weapons; that if nuclear weapons are used against her, she will retaliate, but she will never be the first to use them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If <span class="highlight">China</span> were not sincere in that regard, she could have given nuclear weapons to North Vietnam - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Has the Government stressed how divisive it would be in our region if the United States blocked the admission of Vietnam in the way she for so long blocked the restoration of membership rights to the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under its baleful influence, the conflict in Vietnam escalated into the longest and third largest war this century; it has been at the root of the massive blunders and massive bloodshed of this conflict; it has built up a tawdry totalitarian regime, running a fifthrate power, as the arbiter of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, while a hardly less totalitarian regime drags in its wake the prestige of the mightiest democracy the world has known or will ever know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is regrettable that the Minister for External Affairs, while paying lip-service to the concept of restoring <span class="highlight">China</span> to the international community, returned to the old doctrine that <span class="highlight">China</span> must first give proofs of her fitness to be a member of that community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the standards of international conduct laid down by the Minister were the conditions of membership of the United Nations they would form as good an argument for expelling Russia as for excluding <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The problems of building a rational relationship with <span class="highlight">China</span> are complex enough; it would resolve one difficulty if we were to drop at once the habit of directing sermons rather than proposals to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As one of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s significant trading partners, Australia has certain opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Judging from past experience in <span class="highlight">China</span> and North Vietnam perhaps several hundred thousands, who have supported the war and fought valiantly and who would certainly oppose the conqueror’s subsequent collectivisation programme, might be slaughtered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, we know quite well that neither France nor <span class="highlight">China</span> will sign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Pakistan joined because it believed that the organisation could be an effective lever not against Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> but against its neighbour India. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No Vietnamese Communist, no matter how indoctrinated with Communist ideology, would have sought material support from <span class="highlight">China</span>, a country which for centuries the Vietnamese have regarded as hostile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet our involvement in Vietnam forced the Vietnamese nationalists and Communists into a far closer relationship with Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> than would have been their preference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remember when, during the 1966 elections, the Liberal Party, authorised by its Federal Secretary,  Mr Carrick,  issued a scurrilous leaflet to the effect that the people of Australia should be afraid of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That leaflet showed red arrows pointing down from <span class="highlight">China</span> to Australia to illustrate the aggression that we were to expect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time Australia was trading with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I asked the then Minister for External Affairs,  Mr Hasluck  as he then was, whether <span class="highlight">China</span> was an enemy of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the then Minister for External Affairs said that <span class="highlight">China</span> was not an enemy of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Not one member of the Australian Country Party has ever complained about trade with Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then between 1941 and 1945 Vietnam was treated as a mere pawn in the game of big power by the Soviet Union, <span class="highlight">China</span>, America and Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If someone takes one of these pornographic magazines to Soviet Russia or to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> just how far does that person get? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, he implied that no associations exist between members of the Australian Labor Party and Communists; secondly that there is no danger to Australia from <span class="highlight">China</span>; and thirdly that the Liberals unfairly scare the Australian people.I think that is a fair summation of 3 points implicit in the honourable gentleman’s speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now turn to what the honourable member for Sydney had to say about <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aim of this Government in its relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> is not and has never been to contain <span class="highlight">China</span> as honourable gentlemen have said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That country has the same right to exist as has Australia and has the same right to exist as has <span class="highlight">China</span>’s own neighbours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So as some accommodation has been reached with the USSR it can also be achieved with <span class="highlight">China</span>, but it will be harder and will take longer because the Chinese see themselves, for historical and other reasons, as the centre of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One is the Marsina’, which is owned by the <span class="highlight">China</span> Navigation Co. Ltd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some reason <span class="highlight">China</span> was not coloured red on that propaganda sheet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The implication is that <span class="highlight">China</span> is our enemy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">China</span> is an enemy of Australia the Minister for Shipping and Transport  (Mr Sinclair)  is guilty of treason because he and his colleagues in the Country Party are trading with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the sale of that wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> an act of treason? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The core issue of the foreign affairs setting facing Australia at the moment is the future of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has since gone overseas for a fortnight without elaborating on these cursory comments or fitting them into the wider strategic setting of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is unfortunate because more and more the focus is switching from Vietnam to the whole of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a tragic possibility that in the months ahead we will be referring again to the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> war and not the Vietnam War. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undoubtedly the North Vietnamese have the strength to sustain much greater effort in the three regions of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be possible to vanquish the Communists in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> by military means but it would mean a war in which North Vietnam would have very marked advantages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this would require a massive military effort extending over several years and bringing in its train the destruction of the whole Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The essence of this approach is the achievement of a negotiated settlement in South Vietnam with the objective of neutralising the whole of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the run of events since  President  Johnson started to scale down the war, the best the Americans could achieve would be the stabilisation of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> on the basis which existed early in 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a statement made last week to the Standing Committee of Asian and Pacific Council in Wellington,  Mr Holyoake  pointed to the dangers of a general war in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third approach is one which has never been contemplated even remotely in the thinking of the Government, lt has been stated with quite brutal frankness in the United States by  Senator Fulbright;  it is the ultimate acceptance and recognition of Communist supremacy in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Fulbright  said that the plain fact to come out of the Vietnam war was that North Vietnam was the paramount power in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is the sort of tough minded thinking on Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> which is being put forward with increasing persistence in the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is part of a growing recognition that Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> matters not a jot to America’s security or basic interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary, the Opposition finds itself aligned with the huge volume of thoughts of people who want a negotiated neutrality for the whole of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It raises the possibility that the last haven in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> as yet untouched by war will not be spared the bitter fate of Laos and Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>first, to face <span class="highlight">China</span> on yet another front; second, to extend the influence of Russia as a world power; third, to fill the power vacuum in South East Asia consequent on Britain’s withdrawal and, perhaps, in anticipation of a slowing down of United States activity and influence should the Vietnam conflict be satisfactorily resolved; and, fourth - this is the most important to us - to compete with Japan, Australia and other countries for the growing trade opportunities which will develop in Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This morning it was broadcast that the administration of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> had criticised the Soviet Union for, in this centenary year of Lenin’s birth, straying from Leninism and preaching Socialism while practising imperialism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well, the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat has long since been abandoned in favour of the idea of the dictatorship of the Communist parties whether they happen to be in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, <span class="highlight">China</span> or any other part of the world where Communism prevails. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that only the United States of America, Japan, <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and India would fill the bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Five years ago  Sir Robert  Menzies justi- fied the commitment on 1 great ground: The war in Vietnam, he claimed, was part of the downward thrust of <span class="highlight">China</span> between the Indian and the Pacific Oceans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All along it has been these false interpretations of the nature of the conflict in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> that have trapped us into false responses foredoomed to failure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The crux of  President  Nixon’s statement is that, irrespective of military events in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, irrespective of progress in Paris, American disengagement is irreversible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the deterioration of the situation in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> the process of disengagement is being speeded up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The manner the  President  chose to present this fact to the American public does not alter its meaning, and the full impact of its meaning can be measured when set against the terrible and tragic events in other parts of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> in the past month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> is far too serious for the injection of exercises in self justification such as the Prime Minister indulged in tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>God knows, the United States, the people of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, have paid, are paying a terrible enough price for the lessons of Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only if we grasp this fact - that the decisions by this Government have nothing to do with the real situation in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> - that we can explain why the Government now thinks it is possible to reduce the commitment piecemeal when that was supposed to be totally impossible and irresponsible only a few months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no longer possible to depict or defend this war in terms of the freedom of the Vietnamese people or the people of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, a war for freedom or for democracy, a war against <span class="highlight">China</span> or a war to maintain the American alliance, or any of the other definitions which have been used to extenuate and extend our commitment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of its policy of prolongation has been that the whole of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> is now engulfed in civil and racial war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is idle, in the context of what is now happening in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, to think that one has solved the problem by apportioning blame. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for External Affairs: Is Cambodia a country whose sovereign integrity was solemnly pledged in the Geneva Agreements of 1954 by many countries including mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> and North Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that in the 1954 Geneva Agreements North Vietnam and Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> - continental <span class="highlight">China</span> - joined in assuring the territorial integrity of Cambodia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No aid is given to Japan or Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, although there is a programme of reciprocal fellowships with Japan under the cultural relations programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-33-52">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they do not want a moratorium campaign to stop the war in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, in South Vietnam and an extension of the war to Cambodia, why do they not get up and tell the Government - and they do twist the tails of the Liberals occasionally - to stop selling wool and wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> and wool and wheat to Russia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the conference called by  Mr Malik,  who is the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, all I can say is that he has asked many, many countries, including Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> to be present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their policies are to trade with the enemy, to sell strategic metal, chemicals, scrap iron, tallow, wheat and other essential goods to <span class="highlight">China</span> and wool and wheat to Russia and others who they ‘say are our enemies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Judging from past experience in <span class="highlight">China</span> and North Vietnam perhaps several hundred thousands, who have supported the war and fought valiantly and who would certainly oppose the conquerors’ subsequent collectivisation programme, might be slaughtered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have never met a person knowledgeable on Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> who did not agree that had elections been held probably 80% of the population would have voted for the Communist Ho Chi Minh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same authors pointed out that the persons butchered were not by any means real landlords but were even elected as such from members of the Lao-Dong or Communist Peoples Party in that area because it was necessary to go through the motions of the same kind of annihilation of landlords as had been seen in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But has the aggression or insurgency of North Vietnam, which is supported by <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia, not only against South Vietnam but also against Laos and Cambodia, ever been condemned by the Australian Labor Party? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet they get up in this Parliament with a sanctimonious attitude and try to condemn decent Australians for taking an intelligent view on Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> and the Vietnam war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Acting Prime Minister or the Minister for Defence  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  mention anything about the 4 boys and girls who were shot dead in America because they dared to dissent about the filthy war in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, their intentions are destructive; our intentions are to ensure the freedom of the 3 free countries of the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> peninsula. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He did not devote any part of his speech to the call made by the Foreign Minister of Indonesia,  Mr Malik,  for an international conference - a conference which will deal not only with Vietnam but the crisis which has developed in Cambodia as well, a crisis which has extended this conflict to the whole of Indo <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me that this is one of the most unhappy developments that has occurred in the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Cambodian neutrality, held by Prince Sihanouk, has been the great hope of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It goes on to indicate that  Mr Jacob  Malik, the Soviet Union’s chief delegate to the United Nations, had said that a Geneva conference could bring about a fresh solution and a relaxation of tension in the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> peninsula. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even the long and sometimes torrid period of colonialisation by the French, starting in 1847, cannot be identified as the beginning of the struggle for independence in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Sixteen years ago the Geneva Convention resolved to end the blood bath and to recognise that the people of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> were determined to remain unaccommodated to any foreign power, even to <span class="highlight">China</span>, the greatest, strongest and most numerically powerful country in that region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our professed role is to contain Communistm, which we never distinguish from the nationalistic aspirations of the United States in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> The illiterate population of that unhappy region can hardly read the comic cuts, yet they have attributed to them the capacity to write and understand the works of Marx and Lenin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since his deposition Prince Sihanouk has been, for most of his time, in Peking ot in other parts of continental <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that at this meeting  Mr Chou  En-lai, the Premier of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, was also present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt at all, for example, that in such countries as Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> and North Vietnam there is far more depravity in the treatment of prisoners, far more baseness, far more whatever other words the honourable member used, thar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His Government wanted to provide the Royal Australian Air Force with a type of aircraft which would defend us from the hordes of Indonesia and from the hordes of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party not only does not encourage Asian countries to adopt this point of view but has gone to great lengths to make it quite clear that it is part of its defence policy that Australian forces should not be in countries like Malaysia and Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, for their very presence in those countries, whether actually involved in operations or not, constitutes an aggressive military attitude and an expression of policy by the Commonwealth of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be argued by those people who see no threat at all presented to Australia’s future by the Communists in Moscow and in Peking that the Commonwealth of Australia, in creating a great naval base over a period of a decade in the south western corner of Australia, is making an aggressive act that will encourage the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> to adopt a public attitude that will identify us with aggression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this means is that we have had a credit of some $3, 668m with other countries such as Japan, mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> - honourable members from the Country Party do not like to be reminded of the huge sales of wheat to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> - and the Eastern European bloc which also, if the trade figures are examined, disclose that, a favourable balance of trade exists there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was a recent ministerial visitor from Nationalist <span class="highlight">China</span> offered similar time on ABC television? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did  Dr Han  Suyin, an exponent of the view that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> has a rightful place in the world community, appear on the ABC’s ‘Guest of Honour’ programme on 3rd May 1970? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister assure the House that this privilege will be extended to the growers of over-quota wheat from the next harvest in Western Australia by requesting the Australian Wheat Board to permit the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> unrestricted access to the wheat of that State, thus bringing this wheat into the category of being readily saleable? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of readily saleable Western Australian wheat and the sales to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, mentioned by the honourable member, these sales are made on terms over a period of 12 months and in that case it would not be fully payable within the season. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I made the point that owners of starving stock in Australia were discriminated against blatantly because they were forced to pay a price based on $1.7) per bushel while, at the same time, the Australian Government, through the Australian Wheat Board, was selling wheat to overseas countries, including <span class="highlight">China</span>, at prices well below the domestic price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Marked reductions in imports into India  and  Pakistan and also in those by Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>  and  the Soviet Union were the main cause of the decline in world trade in 1963-69. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, we should especially be aware of the situation in <span class="highlight">China</span>, which is a large and reasonably consistent buyer of our wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been suggested that <span class="highlight">China</span> has purchased wheat from Western countries in order to accumulate locally produced rice for export. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the 1960s <span class="highlight">China</span> was able to import low priced wheat and export more highly priced rice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The implications for Western exporters of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> are obvious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was he who, when  chairman  of the Wheat Board, sold our first consignment of wheat to Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That sale saved the Country Party, notwithstanding that it did not like <span class="highlight">China</span>’s policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>World production in 1966-67 was 6,990 million bushels, again excluding <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Federation steadfastly turned its back on the geographic advantage of Western Australia in respect of its proximity to major markets, particularly <span class="highlight">China</span>, lt is common knowledge that the Chinese would load most of their ships at Western Australian ports if the Wheat Board would permit them to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The best potential market is <span class="highlight">China</span> and when <span class="highlight">China</span> is unable to get wheat elsewhere she comes to us for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is because we have no diplomatic relations established with Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> and therefore no opportunities to set up commercial or trade attaches in Peking as the other countries have done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When those other countries are trying to discover what Chinese wheat needs will be they get out and get the sales before we even discover that <span class="highlight">China</span> is buying wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this connection 1 want to draw the attention of the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Anthony)  to the fact that New Zealand, which I think is the world’s biggest butter exporter and the second biggest seller of cheese, has embarked on a course of penetrating the <span class="highlight">China</span> market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand New Zealand has sold about 20,000 tons of butter to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever the regime in <span class="highlight">China</span> there is no doubt that there will be a continuing demand in that country for products such as wheat - which this Government has taken great pride in selling to it over a considerable time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only should we be exploring what is being done now by New Zealand in <span class="highlight">China</span>; surely it is time that the Commonwealth made a study of the existing factories and their equipment and the existing basis of payment for supplies so that we can get what is desired for export, so that the grower - the producer in this instance - will receive a return that will keep him in business not only for his sake but as an essential unit in a great export enterprise which could be, as far as I am concerned and as far as many other people with confidence in the future are concerned, quite unlimited, lt seems to me that this is a matter of organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that document the SecretaryGeneral acknowledged 2 things: Firstly, that the policy of the North Vietnamese Communists involved all Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>; and secondly, that they were responsible for the confrontation and the conflict from over a decade ago to the present day - they initiated it and they continue it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since the overthrow of Prince Sihanouk in April, which plunged the Khmer people unwillingly and unwittingly into the maelstrom of the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> civil war, the Government, realistically if inconsistently, maintained that Australia would not supply military aid to the Prince’s supplanters in Phnom Penh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is true that the presence of North Vietnamese troops in South Vietnam represents <span class="highlight">China</span> sweeping down between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, as we were told by former Prime Minister  Sir Robert  Menzies, it is no less true that the presence of North Vietnamese troops in Laos and Cambodia poses a similar threat to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> has about a quarter of the world’s population, but because of the folly of international arrangements it has been excluded from the considerations of United Nations organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-38-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Opposition members criticise and condemn the sale of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700923_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask them: Will they prohibit, if by any mischance they ever get into power, the sale of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700923_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the Vietcong flag is such a shameful thing - and honourable members opposite think it is - why does the Government sell wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> which in many cases, as honourable members opposite know, is going to the Vietcong? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because he knows that a lot of the wheat that Australia sells to <span class="highlight">China</span> is going to feed the Vietcong and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Trade and Industry will have noted that the official trade figures show that Australia in the last financial year exported 12,543 tons of iron and steel scrap and waste and 14,000 tons of refined zinc to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As <span class="highlight">China</span> is believed to be the main source of rifles, mortars and ammunition used by the Hanoi and Vietcong forces I ask the right honourable gentleman what steps he has taken to terminate this trade in metals which could, in a single year, produce hundreds of thousands of mortars and millions of rifles and rounds of ammunition for use against Australian and allied forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman knows that iron and steel are among the strategic materials which the Congress of the United States of America has embargoed for export to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> under the Battle Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask him whether iron and steel are among the strategic materials which Western countries, including Australia and Japan, have agreed not to export to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other countries that do not subscribe to it but, as I say, Australia has played a very prominent part in maintaining this strategic list to ensure that materials that can be of a strategic nature are not exported to and used by mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been associated with the migration to Australia of doctors from India, pharmacists from Singapore, cooks from <span class="highlight">China</span>, nurses from Fiji and Thailand, and more latterly I have had some dealings with some people from Macao who have not yet reached here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think this Government has any right to select a reactor of the CANDU type for the purpose of producing nuclear weapons without a full debate in this Parliament on this very question.If we manufacture nuclear weapons in Australia we will commit ourselves to be targeted by nations such as Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, which has perfected delivery systems for its nuclear weapons, and Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will remember that I asked him yesterday about the export of 12,500 tons of iron and steel scrap and waste and 14,000 tons of refined zinc to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now ask the right honourable gentleman how his Department opened up such a valuable market for Australia when no such exports had been achieved in the 2 previous years and when in 1966-67. the first year in which the present classifications of exports were adopted and the last year in which I asked him a question on this matter, there were no exports of zinc to <span class="highlight">China</span> and the exports of iron and steel were less than 1 per cent of those achieved last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Trade and Industry certainly has taken no steps, using the words of the Leader of the Opposition, to open up this trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such trade as there is with <span class="highlight">China</span> is conducted by the Australian Wheat Board in respect of wheat, and in all other respects, to my knowledge, by private individuals in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s policy towards trade with mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> prevents the export of strategic goods, but the policy does not obstruct commercial trade in what are obviously non-strategic goods, for example wheat and wool, which constitute over 95 per cent of our trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> can buy those products elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, in respect of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> and North Korea, Australia maintains control over exports of a large range of additional items of potential strategic significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only the United States, which prohibits direct trade with mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, goes further than Australia does in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir Robert  Menzies was the architect  of  this adventure as far as Australia was concerned and he began the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> policy as a supporter of French rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In pursuit of such a theory and with the undoubted support of the bulk of the nation Australia threw the weight of diplomatic support behind the French effort to continue rule in Indo <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The initial explanation was that we were really fighting <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> was coming south. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Actually, as far as weapons are concerned, <span class="highlight">China</span> has supplied the ginger beer and Russia the champagne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If weapons are the proof, a far stronger case can be made that Russia is actively intervening than that <span class="highlight">China</span> is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confronted wilh the obvious criticism that if <span class="highlight">China</span> is the enemy why supply her with wheat, wool and even some etremely vital materials with a direct military bearing, like rutile, the late Harold Holt admitted that <span class="highlight">China</span> was not involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This varied  Sir Robert  Menzies’ remarkable theory that <span class="highlight">China</span> was thrusting south to separate the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and that that was what the Vietnam war was about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Right at our back door we would have had a foreign country embarking on authoritarian practices, backed by Russia or <span class="highlight">China</span> - I do not know which, but it would not make much difference as far as f am concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that Canada and <span class="highlight">China</span> have agreed to establish diplomatic relations, and in view of the fact that Malaysia will now join our other neighbours, Singapore and Indonesia, in voting against the proposition that the admission of <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations is a matter requiring a two-thirds majority of the General Assembly,I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the Australian Government has reconsidered its own attitude on diplomatic relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> and oh <span class="highlight">China</span>’s admission to the United Nations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Ever since I have been the Minister I have been interested in this question of Canada recognising Red <span class="highlight">China</span> and simultaneously Red <span class="highlight">China</span> recognising Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Chinese Government re-affirms that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Territory of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Canadian Government recognises the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> as the sole legal government of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is no definition of what ‘<span class="highlight">China</span>’ in fact means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have stated - the Prime Minister has recently confirmed this and I now confirm it again-that of course we would like Red <span class="highlight">China</span> to be in the United Nations provided only that it accepted the Declaration of Human Rights and abided by it and provided it was willing to abide by the principles of the Charter itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The condition would be that Red <span class="highlight">China</span> renounced the use of violence and force in an attempt to ensure its political objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>What is the present position regarding the export of what could be considered to be strategic materials to <span class="highlight">China</span> - materials which could be used in the interests of the Government of North Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This company which, in the main, is an efficient one with modern thinking in personnel and administration training in management methods and production techniques is indeed severely affected by the current market prices in the agricultural tractor field caused mainly by the recession in the agricultural industry, and, of course, the lower priced imports now available to the farmer from overseas, including tractors manufactured in mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> or, as it is better known, Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, Czechoslovakia and other European and Asiatic countries such as Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Malaysian Prime Minister, Tun Razak, has stated that he wants Malaysia to be free and neutral and that consequently he feels that <span class="highlight">China</span>, the United States of America and Russia should join together in an attempt to achieve neutrality and freedom in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister for Primary Industry aware of the speculation taking place relative to Australia’s future wheat trade prospects with Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I*, the Minister concerned that future Australian wheat sales to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> could be in jeopardy because of the decision of the Canadian Government to grant diplomatic recognition to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>percussions in Australian sales of wheat  ic  <span class="highlight">China</span> because Canada has now recognised her diplomatically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that we have been making very good sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> since  s  first started making sales in 1960. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During that period, Canada has talked of recognising <span class="highlight">China</span> and of extending her diplomatic relationships with <span class="highlight">China</span>, but this in no way has affected our sales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed we have made larger sales to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> than Canada has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although in the last 12 months, we have sold 2.2 million metric tons of wheat to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> as against a Canadian sale of 2.3 million metric tons of wheat to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, if one looks at the period since sales first started to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> in September 1960, one sees that Australia has sold 19.7 million metric tons of wheal and Canada has sold 17.5 million metric tons of wheat to that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that <span class="highlight">China</span> buys wheat where she gets the type she requires and at the prices that she considers most favourable to her for that type of wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one wishes to speculate as to what might happen, one also can ask: What will be the consequences to Russia’s sale arrangements - they have expired - and will Canada’s recognition of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> have any effect on Russia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one does not wish them, for example, to understand the situation in Rhodesia, South Africa or, on the other hand, Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, one simple ensures- if, for instance, it is the Government’s desire - that ‘ one does not send a team there so that the members of that team can be in a position to convey an effective understanding of these things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last few weeks the Malaysian Government, in pressing for accommodatios with <span class="highlight">China</span> - Mainland  or  Communist, depending on whether  or  not wheat is being sold to it, as far as the Aus tralian Country Party is concerned - and the neutralisation of South East Asia, guaranteed by the United States of America, the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span>, has shown a sanity and a maturity which is sadly lacking in this Liberal-Country Party Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On Wednesday last, the Minister for External Affairs, referring to Malaysia’s intentions regarding <span class="highlight">China</span>’s admission to the United Nations, told the House that Malaysia would abstain from a vote on the actual recognition of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, ls it a fact that Tun Ismael, the Malaysian Minister, stated on the 5th of this month that: ‘Malaysia would if necessary co-sponsor any move to admit <span class="highlight">China</span> by a simple majority’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it because he feels that the position of the Government on Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> is so untenable that he must mislead the House in order to make it appear credible- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman who asked me a question earlier today was one of the first to admit that he did have the wool pulled from off his eyes, but apparently he did not have it pulled far enough so far as the implications were concerned when he referred to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Soviet diplomatic initiative of 1969, to which Freeth responded positively, was designed to organise some kind of an association in South East Asia against <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there has been a tendency for Australians, and probably Americans, to regard Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> as world public enemy No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red <span class="highlight">China</span> is completely committed to Maoism, which in simple terms is the practice and advocacy for other nations of old-fashioned reactionary Communism but not direct military involvement in other nations affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present regime in <span class="highlight">China</span> possesses a fanatical conviction in some sort of dream world Communist Utopia where all nations achieve the purity of Maoist thoughts by internal revolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has been the recognition by Canada of the Peking Government and the presumption that Canada will support the admission of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One may well ask why Australia should not recognise mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, Australia gives de facto recognition to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> when we trade with her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One may well ask why should we not trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So why then should we not recognise Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why we cannot recognise mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> or support its admission to the United Nations is not the fault of Australia or the Western democracies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the price that mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> demands for condescending to join the United Nations - a price that I would think no principled nation should be prepared to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>’s price of recognition is twofold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> requires that Taiwan, a nation of 14 million people - a population bigger than that of Australia - should be kicked out, holus bolus, from the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> requires the acceptance of the sovereignty of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> over the 14 million free Chinese in Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By its conditions, Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> precludes its own admission to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>wording - of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>’s claim to sovereignty over Taiwan despite the wishes of the people of that country and simultaneously to break off diplomatic relations with the free Chinese Government of Taiwan shows, I believe, the Canadian Governlent of  Mr Pierre  Trudeau to be one of expediency rather than one of principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> probably feels that time is on her side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has only to remain stubborn at the Paris Peace talks and allow its friends in Australia and America to go ahead with their moratoriums to undermine the resistance of the Western democracies to its aggression in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also pointed out that if it is right to recognise Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span> on the basis that you cannot deny that they exist, then by the same premise you must also recognise Rhodesia because you cannot deny that it exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you place sanctions on Rhodesia because you do not like its policies, surely then to be consistent you should place sanctions on Russia or mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> when you dislike their policies, or else you do it to  none  of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard all sorts of calls to arms: Churchilliantype phrases about what the Russians atc doing in the world: reference to the terrible situation that is facing the poor little Government of Rhodesia; cries of violence in the street and political power being taken out of the hands of the duly elected representatives of Australia and reference to our refusal to recognise Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> and a refusal to recognise that Australia should disengage from the war in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He asked: “Why not recognise Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us have a look at the criticism of <span class="highlight">China</span>, which was levelled by the honourable member for Deakin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said: ‘Why should not we recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, he said that <span class="highlight">China</span> demands the expulsion of Taiwan from the United Nations and, secondly, that <span class="highlight">China</span> demands sovereignty over Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Deakin also ignored one very significant fact about Canada’s recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>, and it was that Canada was enabled to recognise Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> without recognising the 2 arguments that he mentioned which were put forward by <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally important is the view that the Malaysian Government is taking towards the recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not just the Canadians who want to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>; it is the Malaysians also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His point of view was that <span class="highlight">China</span> was a threat to the region and for that reason it must be top priority to bring her into the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the complete reverse to this Government’s policy, which is that <span class="highlight">China</span> is a threat to this region and for this reason she must be further and further isolated, alienated and contained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I merely make this simple statement, that the Malaysian Government puts it down as the main priority, that <span class="highlight">China</span> should be brought into the international community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The official position of the Malaysian Government as to the admission of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations is exactly as I stated it in answer to a question asked by the Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the important question’ the Malaysian Government will vote against it and on the question of the admission of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations: it will abstain from voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said - and this is an entirely different question - that Malaysia would be willing to co-sponsor a resolution admitting continental or Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But he went on to say - and this is the very important part of what he said - that Malaysia believed that Taiwan <span class="highlight">China</span>, that is, the Republic of  <span class="highlight">China</span>,  should remain a member of the United Nations, and as well that the people of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> should have the right of self-determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus while Malaysia believes Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> should be admitted by a simple majority it does not believe that Taiwan should be expelled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Albanian resolution means recognition of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> and the expulsion of Taiwan or the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also said that if there was a simple resolution for the admission of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> which made no reference to Taiwan then Malaysia would associate itself with that resolution and vote for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the House that 10 years ago <span class="highlight">China</span> did not have an atomic warhead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went so far as to say that that neutrality should bc protected and preserved and guaranteed  -  I think that was the word he used - by the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, lt is not very surprising that the Opposition should over the last few days have seized upon this statement as evidence that there is some sort of collapse in this Government’s defence policy, that there is some sort of basic change in the defence and foreign policies of Malaysia, and that the whole situation politically in South East Asia has changed dramatically and basically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, he asks for a guarantee from Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> and the other 2 great powers of neutrality of the region and the neutrality of Malaysia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, what he is saying here, when one looks and thinks of the specific terms in which he puts it, is not merely that there should be some utterance by Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> that it will guarantee, in some loose way, this neutrality that the Prime Minister looks for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> to maintain that neutrality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What he wants, and what we want is what we have always maintained, namely, that Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> should cease its aggression against the smaller nations of South East Asia and should cease arming, helping and financing Communists in Indo <span class="highlight">China</span> who are seeking to upset the governments that are presently in power in those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> should cease its actions which are destined solely to prevent the people of those countries in South East Asia from determining their own type of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> should cease the aggression that it has been engaged in over recent years towards countries in South East Asia and, in particular, that it should cease trying to achieve that object by financing, arming and giving support to Communist movements in South East Asian countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should have some assurances from Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> that she would abide by the policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when one has looked at what the Malaysian Prime Minister wants to see in action from Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, one can go from there to see what Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> has done in the past, because by its actions in the past, I suggest, one can get some indication of what its actions are likely to be in the immediate future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can look at its actions towards Taiwan and the off-shore islands of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its present policy should be enough to indicate that there is little, if any, likelihood that Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> would wish to or would take any steps at all towards guaranteeing the neutrality of Malaysia, any other country in South East Asia, or the region itself, because one can see what Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> is doing at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as the Far Eastern Economic Review has been able to estimate, Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> is spending $US200m a year in arming South East Asian Communists in the countries in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has given positive and articulated promises to Communist movements in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> that they can have safe rear areas in mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>; that it will give political support to those Communist movements; that it will give material support to those Communist movements and that it will give military support to those Communist movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have thought that the classic example illustrating that there can be no assurance at all that Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> would be interested in guaranteeing the neutrality of South East Asia is the closed door policy that it took towards the Djakarta conference on Cambodia, because here was a clear case of an opportunity to have a degree of neutrality brought about in 1 South East Asian country - Cambodia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I venture to suggest that there is no evidence whatsoever to indicate that Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> is interested in or able to achieve that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, Malaysia will look for some indication of integrity and some indication that Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> would refrain from subversion and aggression in South East Asia; secondly, Malaysia still recognises the dangers of the Communist menace to neutrality in the region, and thirdly, Malaysia will continue to - contribute to peace and stability in the region of South East Asia, lt is our policy that if one has to negotiate on matters such as the neutrality of South East Asia, one should negotiate from a position of strength and not weakness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, one wants to see co-operation not only with Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> but with any country which is prepared to leave other countries, such as those in South East Asia, alone and with any country that is prepared to refrain from’ aggression and from assisting subversive elements in those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have very grave doubts whether Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> is interested in the slightest in maintaining or guaranteeing neutrality in South East Asia so 1 venture to suggest that members of the Opposition are perhaps somewhat misguided, with all respect to them, in thinking that in this statement from the new Prime Minister of Malaysia is an indication of a change in his foreign or defence policy and that, consequently, there will be changes in our foreign or defence policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I found it interesting to hear the honourable member for Diamond Valley  (Mr Brown)  putting forward his arguments, particularly as 1 agree with him in part when he said that he believes that we should be looking for <span class="highlight">China</span> to recognise and protect the neutrality of South East Asian countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that <span class="highlight">China</span> should do this with the countries that are her neighbours If this had been done in Vietnam by our allies there would not have been the death and destruction that has taken place in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite all that the delegates heard at this conference they still return to this chamber muttering all sorts of hackneyed cliches such as ‘non-interference’, ‘the Russians are just as bad’, and ‘if it is wrong to trade with Rhodesia it is wrong to trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What they fail to understand is that while most of these countries have no love for Russia or <span class="highlight">China</span> or their political systems, these countries do not persecute, suppress or exploit people on the basis of the colour of their skin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is a different situation to South Vietnam I would like to hear it This was the first time that <span class="highlight">China</span> showed its hand at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Malaysia will vote against the important question but it will abstain from a vote on the actual recognition of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that honourable members opposite read bis statement of 22nd January 1968 in which he suggested that it would be necessary for Malaysia to establish a policy of non-alignment and that the area should be neutralised, that neutrality being guaranteed by Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The essential point is that the Government of Malaysia is no longer obstructing the admission of the Chinese into the United Nations and, most importantly, it is moving in the direction of recognising <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Australian Government cannot recognise this basic fact, that Malaysia’s policy towards <span class="highlight">China</span> is changing, then it does not know the world in which we live and it simply cannot plan defence policies for this country, because they will be based upon a fallacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for External Affairs, in reply to one question served up by the honourable member for Diamond Valley  (Mr Brown),  said that Malaysia would be willing to co-sponsor a resolution admitting continental or Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for External Affairs went on to say - and to him this is the important thing - that Malaysia believed that Taiwan <span class="highlight">China</span>, that is, the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, should be made a member of the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The important thing is that the Malaysian Government is prepared to co-sponsor the admission of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> into the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the Malaysian point of view, no longer will a two-thirds majority be required to obstruct the admission of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if the issue was raised that Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> should be admitted and Taiwan <span class="highlight">China</span> should be expelled, the Government of Malaysia would abstain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a fundamental change in Malaysia’s policy towards <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is K the view of the Malaysian Government that the question of the admission of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations should be determined by a simple majority vote at the United Nations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Australian Government disagrees with the Malaysian Government’s new attitude on the question of the admission of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations, what effect does this have on our relations with Malaysia and our concepts of forward defence in Malaysia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In trading with Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> yet refusing to recognise that nation, is Australia becoming isolated from a majority of the countries of Asia and from Australia’s partners in the Commonwealth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The implication seems to be that the majority of the countries in Asia and other members of the British Commonwealth are not trading with Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> and therefore, because we trade with Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, we are becoming separated from them; but this of course is a completely false premise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I know, most countries in the world trade with Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, though a number of them, including ourselves, have regard to a list of exports so that warlike material is not traded with Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the question of the recognition of that country, some countries recognise and have diplomatic relations with Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is all too apparent in the case of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gets the best of the deal, of course, by being as anti-Communist as anyone else and it talks to an audience which does not find it apparently inconsistent to sell $200m to $300m worth of commodities to <span class="highlight">China</span> at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They do not see any inconsistency in selling these products to <span class="highlight">China</span> at the same time as it is said: ‘We are in great danger because of the downward thrust of <span class="highlight">China</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia will recognise the Government of <span class="highlight">China</span> before long because Australia will be moved into this by money, and money has more influence on the people who make decisions in this Government than does ideology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 want to quote’ an article appearing in the ‘South <span class="highlight">China</span> Mail’ of Saturday 25 July 1970 which states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is it that we have had such a favourable situation with <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> 10 years ago were worth $40m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To mention a few of those countries I have listed, Japan, the United Slates of America, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Canada, Malaysia, Poland and Yugoslavia all have certain discernible characteristics and are all open to further expansion of markets if we are realistic about this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span> now manufacture most of the cheaper goods, there is no reason why we could not capture a large percentage of the medium and, I believe, the high priced fashion garments sales in the world’s markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is also very heartening if one looks a little further afield to see that we recognise some of our imperfections and are looking constantly for better ways to identify those people who are suitable for further education beyond the secondary sphere, lt makes a very nice contrast, for example - if I may be a little irrelevant - to the resurgence of university attendance in the last few weeks or months in mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs been drawn to a statement by the Leader ofthe Country Party and  Deputy  Prime Minister indicating that his Party was considering the recognition of Red <span class="highlight">China</span>,no doubt because of the failure ofwheat sales to its Communist customers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, is it a fact that recognition of Red <span class="highlight">China</span> is now under consideration and that economic considerations rather than the allegedhigh principles espoused in the past will be the major factor in the Government’s decision to turn a policy somersault and recognise Red <span class="highlight">China</span> as soon as possible? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have examined problems of diplomatic relationships and I doubt whether we have once mentioned as a decisive influence the question of sales of wheat or any other commodity to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister no doubt will recall telling the House on 14th October last in reply to a question from me that he had instructed bis Department to review the list of materials approved for export to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of this review, has any alteration been made to the arrangement which at present allows the export to <span class="highlight">China</span> of materials capable of being used in the manufacture of armaments and other strategic items which could be used against Australian forces currently engaged in the lndo <span class="highlight">China</span> war? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already there is an embargo against the export to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, or to the Peoples Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, of any goods which can be used for military purposes against any forces whatsoeverand that, of course, includes Australian forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Look at the present position in the wheat industry with respect to <span class="highlight">China</span> and the policy in relation to wheat sales to the Arab States, (licenceeived subsidies, pious hopes, non-existent export markets and desperate ad hoc decisions have resulted in a collapse in the viability of Australian agriculture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Prime Minister at the time, the Right Honourable  Sir Robert  Menzies, announced on 29th April 1965 that these combat troops would be sent to Vietnam he did so in the context of a continuing thrust of <span class="highlight">China</span> between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710219_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the failure of the 56 wheat growing countries to reach agreement on prices for the next 3 years and the inroads into trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> made by our great and powerful friends and allies such as Canada, Japan and Britain, will the Minister, in the interests of Australian trade and Aus tralian producers, consider opening a trade office or even a Wheat Board agency in Peking until the battle of conscience over <span class="highlight">China</span> and party preferences has been resolved by himself and his colleagues? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Somewhat facetious questions like this do not help the Australian Wheat Board in endeavouring to negotiate with mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> for the sale of wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the past 3 or 4 months we have been waiting to hear from mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> about a possible sale of wheat in the same way that we have been notified each year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately this year no contract has been made yet, but I am still very hopeful and optimistic that we will hear from <span class="highlight">China</span> before too long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that 2 factors have come into play which have allowed <span class="highlight">China</span> to defer possible discussions about the purchase of wheat this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I believe that because of the record we have and the satisfaction that <span class="highlight">China</span> has derived from purchasing large quantities of wheat from Australia it is fairly conclusive that we will be seeing more of her in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As we ail know, sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> are rather hazardous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether, if the long awaited letter arrives from <span class="highlight">China</span>, and the order is large enough, wc will be able to meet it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a more appropriate moment a little later on 1 would like (o examine just what our situation would be with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, <span class="highlight">China</span> is not really there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I suggested before, we should at least open a wheat board office or a trade office in <span class="highlight">China</span> as a matter of urgency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The prospects for trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> are continuing ones, for various reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly we would be on far better’ ground to assess what <span class="highlight">China</span> is going to do in the future if we had our own people on the spot evaluating the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our farmers would have an increase in sales of at least 100 million bushels per year potential which is twice the size of the former <span class="highlight">China</span> market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point I make is that the Wheat Board is having difficulties in getting a communication channel with Red <span class="highlight">China</span>, or continental <span class="highlight">China</span> as some people would prefer to call it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a funny thing that this Government recognises Red Russia, but it will not recognise Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government refuses to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span> politically in the councils of the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> does not exist in the councils of the United Nations, so far as this Government is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably we are losing the opportunity to renew our wheat agreement with <span class="highlight">China</span> because we refuse to recognise that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Canada recognised continental <span class="highlight">China</span> late last year or early this year - 1 am not quite sure of the actual date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this is what has happened: The Canadian Wheat Board officials signed a $70m wheat contract with <span class="highlight">China</span> 2 weeks after Canada’s diplomatic recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I claim right here that this stubborn, pigheaded, conservative Government will cost Australian wheat growers possibly hundreds of millions of dollars in the next year or so because it refuses to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Country Party is prepared to accept all the benefits which flow from trading with <span class="highlight">China</span>, but it is a part of the coalition Government and, to my knowledge, it has done nothing to put pressure on the Liberal Party in order to get the Government to recognise Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What has <span class="highlight">China</span> bought from us? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the last 10 years <span class="highlight">China</span> has emerged as Australia’s major wheat customer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1966 <span class="highlight">China</span> has bought $500m worth of Australian wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have received no replies from <span class="highlight">China</span>’s officials to cables asking for the negotiation of a major new wheat deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last October the Australian Wheat Board twice cabled Peking requesting that an Australian delegation be invited to <span class="highlight">China</span> to discuss the possibility of negotiating a new wheat contract. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although members of the Australian Wheat Board are on standby to fly to <span class="highlight">China</span>, no invitation has yet come to this country asking it to go and negotiate a new wheat contract. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Moore truthfully said, the prospects of Australian wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> are depressing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is reported that the green revolution has made <span class="highlight">China</span> almost self sufficient in grain production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That may be another reason why <span class="highlight">China</span> may not want to buy wheat from us this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> has every right to be political. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not blame <span class="highlight">China</span> for saying: ‘We are still an orphan in the Pacific as far as Australia is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Si 10m wheat contract between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span> which came into operation early last year is on the verge of expiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> is taking approximately 25 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Wilmot said that we should recognise Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How often have I heard in this place the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  and other members of the Opposition by way of interjection ask why the Country Party sells wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the last 4 or 5 years most members of the Australian Labor Party have been criticising wheat sales to Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now the honourable member for Wilmot is saying that everything is lovely, that we should sell wheat to Red <span class="highlight">China</span> and that we should recognise Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why do we not recognise Red <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason is that we have some thought for what is known as Nationalist <span class="highlight">China</span> and the future of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because it cannot make sales to Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Country Party refer to Red <span class="highlight">China</span> when they say that its forces are about to invade Australia, but they refer to Mainland <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> when the are about to sell wheat to that nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This year they have not sold any wheat to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> and that is the reason why al this stage measures such as this one are before the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We refer to the hypocrisy of members of the Country Party for criticising Red <span class="highlight">China</span> and its policies, on the one hand, while sending emissaries there to sell our products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Argentina, Brazil, Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, Rumania, India, Italy, South Africa, USSR and Uruguay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710318_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for Trade and Industry aware of the magnitude of the problem confronting the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in its efforts to gainfully employ and raise the living standards of its vast population? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister request the Australian Wool Commission to send a mission, comprising persons fully qualified and experienced in wool selling and processing techniques as well as at least one person skilled in handling and arranging finance, to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> with a view to selling direct to its Government wool from the stockpile presently held by the Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian Wheat Board, and this has been the body which has initiated and been able to successfully negotiate sales to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of wool, I would certainly not give a direction to the Australian Wool Board, or to any other group, to send representatives to <span class="highlight">China</span> in order to try to sell wool there, but what I would be quite happy to do is to consult my colleague, the Minister for Primary Industry, on the question which the honourable member has raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of all these Prime Ministers he has been the hottest in his optimism and the coldest in his perception of what this war has meant in human terms - in terms of scorched earth and scorched bodies, in terms of the devastation of the whole of Jndo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, in terms of the destruction of one of the proudest civilisations in the region and in terms of the degradation of an entire generation of the Vietnamese people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the political situation, not the situation in Phuoc Tuy Province or Vietnam or Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, that has prescribed the terms of the announcement today by the new Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing so fully epitomises the Government’s total lack of understanding of the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> catastrophe as the Minister for Defence’s statements on the operation in Laos. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It resents that Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> refuses to fit into its own preconceptions and preoccupations or, as the Prime Minister himself put it last year when as Minister for Externa] Affairs he was speaking on Cambodia: ‘it does not readily fit into my framework’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these negative results have been achieved at the price of the devastation of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a kind of unholy alliance with Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span>, we have provided the 2 Vietnams with almost limitless capacity for mutual self-destruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must realise that <span class="highlight">China</span> is an important country as far as pig production is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is one thing for which I would not have paid all the rice in <span class="highlight">China</span>, because in those days the Labor Party gave nothing but a mere pittance of a handout. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He began his ministry by insulting one of our major trading associates, <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He declared loftily that he would not be pushed into recognising <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event the letter he has been awaiting from <span class="highlight">China</span> on wheat still has not arrived, while other major trading nations such as Canada, France, Britain, Italy and others have hurried to both recognition and trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Japan, which does not extend diplomatic recognition to <span class="highlight">China</span>, certainly recognises the facts of trade, has an agreement, has an office and has $800m in two way trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just how out of touch with trading reality the Minister ils can be measured by his reply to the honourable member for Moore  (Mr Maisey),  a member of his own Party, who urged new initiatives with <span class="highlight">China</span> in relation to wool. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The gulf in thinking between Left and Right on how Australia’s security should be sought and how her relations with other countries - Russia, <span class="highlight">China</span>, the United States - should be conducted has never been bridged and was not bridged at the last ALP conference, where ‘unity’ was the  watchcry  so loudly proclaimed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710402_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way the differences can be papered over at election time is by saying as little as possible, by omitting (as did  Mr Whitlam)  any mention of the ANZUS or SEATO treaty, by neglecting (as did  Mr Whitlam)  to express any opinion on such urgent controversies as the recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span> or Russia’s proposed Asian collective security system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710402_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that the British Government has sent on to him a communication from the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We did receive a communication from the British Government from a source within <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could not be regarded as speaking on behalf of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that communication the statement was made that for political reasons the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> would not be purchasing Australian wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were many people who urged us not to get too heavily involved with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> because it might try to intimidate us for political reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently we are not so heavily reliant upon the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> - that is, Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> - for the sale of our wheat this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ask the Prime Minister a question on his statement 24 hours ago about the communication he had received through the British Government from a source within <span class="highlight">China</span> concerning the sale of Australian wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The source of information did not come from within <span class="highlight">China</span>, but it came to an official of the British Consulate-General in Hong Kong* from allegedly Chinese sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The first cable I received relating to the political intentions of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> was from Hong Kong and it was that which I was referring to in answer to the question yesterday and in answer to the question today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For years the Government, the Country Party in particular, has been conducting a two-faced approach towards <span class="highlight">China</span> in an endeavour to hoodwink farmers and the Australian public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As is well known on this side of the House, before elections a bitter campaign of hate is always launched against <span class="highlight">China</span> in an endeavour to side with the Democratic <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As soon as the election has passed the same ministerial gentlemen, acting on behalf of the Australian Government, spend their time wooing <span class="highlight">China</span> in an endeavour to retain that nations goodwill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who will ever forget the fanatical hate campaign which was launched against Labor in the 1966 Federal election campaign and which revolved round a map depicting <span class="highlight">China</span>, South-East Asia and Australia with red arrows emanating from <span class="highlight">China</span> and engulfing Australia, indicating that <span class="highlight">China</span> was ready to invade Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently the Australian Government, particularly Country Party Ministers, believes that this hypocrisy will not be taken seriously by <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spearheading this attack against <span class="highlight">China</span> is always the new  Deputy  Prime Minister, who seems to delight in such political dishonesty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The continuation of these insults to <span class="highlight">China</span> has now resulted in a death blow to the Australian wheat industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>, of course, has bided its time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As soon as Canada gave full diplomatic recognition to <span class="highlight">China</span>, the writing became evident on the wail for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government was warned by industry leaders and in this Parliament to tread very carefully and not to insult <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite urgent requests from responsible sections of the Australian community, including the wheat industry, to take a commonsense viewpoint towards <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Australian Government continues lo cling to the coat tails of the United States and to deliver public insults to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new Minister for Trade and Industry, it will be recalled, arrogantly stated that political considerations would never influence <span class="highlight">China</span> in her trade relations with Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He believed nothing was wrong with insulting <span class="highlight">China</span> in one minute and patting her on the back in the next. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do honourable members realise that in the last 8 years <span class="highlight">China</span> has bought from Australia just on $ 1,000m worth of produce? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, more pertinent is the fact that <span class="highlight">China</span> could have been one of Australia’s most important customers in the future in the expansion of rural exports to South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the Government’s hate of <span class="highlight">China</span> has resulted in a blow that should never have happened if the Government had acted in a responsible and mature way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Labor Government will recognise <span class="highlight">China</span> and it will trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In con trast, the United States refuses to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span> and will not trade wilh her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although we may not agree wilh the policy of the United Stales of America towards <span class="highlight">China</span> we nevertheless must respect its consistency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But who could respect the double standards of Australia bitterly attacking <span class="highlight">China</span> and branding her as a potential enemy while at the same time grovelling to <span class="highlight">China</span> to save our wheat industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it too late lo resurrect our trading partnerships with <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the Australian Government should immediately adopt a mature policy towards <span class="highlight">China</span> by preparing a constructive case for the recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span> and divorcing itself from the coat tails of the United States in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the House that <span class="highlight">China</span> has a population of 750 million. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Australia does not take an independent diplomatic initiative towards <span class="highlight">China</span> we could well be the last nation of any consequence to recognise this giant country which is of such importance to us now and which will certainly be of even greater importance in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The communication from the British Government apparently informing Australia of the position of <span class="highlight">China</span> has been not classified but made top secret. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the position at the present time of Australia belittling and refusing to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span> and insulting <span class="highlight">China</span>, but wooing <span class="highlight">China</span> at every opportunity when this becomes necessary if we are to sell <span class="highlight">China</span> our wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the Labor Party is concerned, as I said before, a Labor Government will recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Labor Government will trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>, and there may be no fear of any Australian soldiers being killed by the North Vietnamese who are fed with Chinese wheat because a Labor Government will have no troops at all in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wouldn’t recognise Red <span class="highlight">China</span> just to sell wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States has a point of view on Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, she sees certain international implications which would make it difficult for her in relation to Formosa if Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> were to be recognised immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 would hope we can clear some of these problems in order that Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> might be recognised, in time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I would not sell my soul just to benefit trade, and I don’t believe it’s a significant factor in selling wheat to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been suggested that the reply given yesterday by the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  indicated that there was some other statement or, by innuendo, there was a response by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> - or mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, as you will - to this statement which was the main reason for <span class="highlight">China</span> not negotiating further sales of wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having spoken about the statement in general he said: lt could not  be regarded as speaking  on  behalf  of  the People’s Republic  of  <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this instance the statement was related specifically to a commercial transaction and there is no substance in the allegation that anything has been said by the  Deputy  Prime Minister which in any way has caused the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to come out and say that no sale will be concluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position is that <span class="highlight">China</span> has, of course, been a very significant purchaser of Australian wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that over the years when she suffered a series of crop failures and when there were very critical supply shortages and a low level of world wheat stocks - honourable members will recall it was not only <span class="highlight">China</span> which had stock failures but also the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and that at the same time there were increasing needs in developing countries - there was developed in the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> a very good and substantial market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as a member of the Australian Wheat Board at the time, was partly instrumental in securing the first commercial sales of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the contrary, the position quite obviously is that in mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> for quite normal commercial reasons there have been a number of circumstances which have certainly reduced that country’s need to buy wheat this year, lt is true that the green revolution is not confined to India, Pakistan or the other countries of South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The green revolution has meant that through the use of fertilisers and the use of rapidly growing and high yielding Mexican wheats there is a very substantial increase in production in a great part of Asia, and <span class="highlight">China</span> has not, of course, been outside that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told, in the same way as we get so many of these reports, that this year <span class="highlight">China</span> has enjoyed fairly good seasons in its agricultural belt and, of course, that factor has to be taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that in the past sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> have varied according to seasonal circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> have been determined not only on domestic demand circumstances but also on external commercial circumstances, so that they have been prepared to go out into the market place and argue as one would expect a country to argue to get the best price, the best terms and the product which was best suited for integration into their own domestic needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> has always operated on that basis and there is no suggestion that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> has suddenly this year found that she has been excluded from all these commercial factors which, in the past, have been so significant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a few other significant factors about the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is this complex of reasons which surround market demand and the possibility of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> coming in and buying wheat this year or next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, it is interesting to see what the industry’s feeling is about the prospects of sale of wheat to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, he is still hopeful in a field in which only rumour has it that there will be no sales of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that the Australian Wheat Board has established close relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>; Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Board has continued to maintain these close domestic relations which 1 am quite sure will ensure that in the future we will again be able to re-establish the market in mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems very difficult to understand how the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  can allege that the terms of a matter of public importance, which is concerned with increasing wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span>, with selling more wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> and with trying to encourage the Australian Government and the responsible Ministers to be wise and diplomatic in relation to <span class="highlight">China</span>, can possibly be against the interests of Australian primary producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister told the House that he does not consider that the decline and final end to wheat sales by Australia lo <span class="highlight">China</span> has anything to do with Australian attitudes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the decline and final termination of sales of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> are caused by objective conditions, such as the green revolution - increased production in <span class="highlight">China</span> - and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But does the Minister know that in the last 12 months <span class="highlight">China</span> has bought more wheat from Canada than ever before? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he know that in the last 12 months <span class="highlight">China</span> has bought more wheat from other countries that her total imports of wheat are some 20 per cent or 30 per cent greater than they were in any year before? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is it that when <span class="highlight">China</span> is buying more wheat from Canada and more wheat from other countries she has suddenly stopped buying wheat from Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody would agree that the sale of wheat by Australia to <span class="highlight">China</span> is not of very great value to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1962 we have sold about S800m worth of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The market in <span class="highlight">China</span> is of great value to our wheat farmers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think that everybody will agree that it is of great value to Australia to sell its wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> and that the Government should do whatever is wise, reasonable and principled to sell Australian wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I wonder whether anyone who supports the Government will consider it is wise for one of its Ministers - in this case it was the Minister for Trade and Industry  (Mr Anthony)  - ro come out on television at the very point at which negotiations for the sale of Austraiian wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> might be crucial, namely, the last week or so of negotiations, with a statement that he would not self his soul just because of trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said: ‘I would not do business with <span class="highlight">China</span> at the expense of my soul’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question here is not whether Australia should recognise <span class="highlight">China</span> - if that is otherwise wrong - in order to sell our wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it .were wrong or if it were against Australia’s interest to recognise Chinn there would be no tenable reason why we should recognise <span class="highlight">China</span> merely to sell wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Trade and Industry and other Ministers have made an issue of their souls being involved in business with <span class="highlight">China</span> at the very time when business with <span class="highlight">China</span> in the form of the sale of wheat is crucial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that for 9 years <span class="highlight">China</span> has never raised the question of recognition it is at a crucial point in business with <span class="highlight">China</span> made an issue by us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon),  shooting from the hip like the former one, was asked a question in the House about Italy’s recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that it was unfortunate that Italy had recognised <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government and its Ministers have never used common sense about <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They have wanted to defame and insult <span class="highlight">China</span> for local political reasons and, al the same time, they have wanted to do business wilh <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Crocker  is saying is that the sale of $800m or S900m worth of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>, as well as every other relationship, has been endangered by the narrow political concept which unproportionately influences the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wheat has been sold to <span class="highlight">China</span> for 9 years without Australian recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span> and it may have been sold for years yet without this recognition if Ministers had spoken sensibly and had controlled their tendency to shout insults and condemn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would expect any statement which is made about the attitude of the Australian Government to the recognition of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> to come from the Minister for Foreign Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Bury),  the Prime Minister and, in his speech here this afternoon, the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  have in the last week for the first time been referring to <span class="highlight">China</span> as the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to that they referred to it as Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> or Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be seen that the Government, which has up to now taken a highly moralistic position - I think it was essentially a political position - not torecognise <span class="highlight">China</span> merely to sell its wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> is rapidly coming round to the recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its Ministers are now talking about the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No longer is it Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> or Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All their precautions about their moral attitude to <span class="highlight">China</span> and all their political posturing around the country about the selling of their souls if they deal with <span class="highlight">China</span> have to end because they are going to have to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span> in order to sell wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The attitude of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Leader of the Austraiian Country Party towards Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> which has resulted iti the loss of Australia’s mo.-.t important wriedt market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Minister was asked a .question about the recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>, he said that there were difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope we  cm  clear some of these problems in order that Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> might be recognised in time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hut f would not sell my soul just to benefit trade, and ( don’t believe it’s a significant factor in selling wheat to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>then we can recognise Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was said that a British diplomat had conveyed information in Hong Kong that the Minister for Trade and Industry had been named as somebody who had upset Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We bought only a little more than S32m so we have had a developing trade with 750 million people, lt is true that although this represented a major effort in wheat selling and mainly as a result of industry initiative - and f stress that - the rest of the world, recognising the improvement in the stability of <span class="highlight">China</span> and noticing a perceptible improvement in marketing prospects, has been rushing to trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It not only failed to take any initiatives in <span class="highlight">China</span> but it effec tively sabotaged the efforts of the Australian Wheat Board, and the instrument of that sabotage was the Minister for Trade and Industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the flush of : his new power, on 7th February he went out of his way in arrogant condensation to tell Australia and the world that he would not be pushed into recognising <span class="highlight">China</span> for the purpose of selling wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the point that if he feels this way about <span class="highlight">China</span> he should get out of the Trade and Industry portfolio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tragedy of the <span class="highlight">China</span> situation is that despite questioning in this Parliament, despite fears by the industry, and despite a revolt against the Minister in circles of his own Party he has persisted in an attitude of arrogance quite unreal and unacceptable in a man who is supposed to be Australia’s first salesman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the Government has made a decision in principle to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia could become major customers for Australian wool, if the Federal Government offered flexible foreign exchange terms and <span class="highlight">China</span> was given diplomatic recognition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span> need Australian wool. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first thing we can do is to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the tip of the revolting iceberg, but against the background of all this is not only the matter of wheat sales to Red <span class="highlight">China</span>; it is a matter of the whole of Australia’s balance of trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, there is the failure of his policy towards <span class="highlight">China</span>, with disastrous results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude of the Minister seems to coalesce around these words: ‘1 would not recognise Red <span class="highlight">China</span> just to sell wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there will be a change in the Government’s policy on the recognition of Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not speak for the Government.I simply say that there seems to be a change in world opinion and that in my view, as a backbench member, there will be a change in Australia’s stand on the recognition of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What kind of a man would the Minister for Trade and Industry be if when he was first interviewed he said: ‘I am a member of the Government andI stand with the Government policy on Red <span class="highlight">China</span>,’ but at his next interview he said: ‘Well, it does not apply to wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What kind of a Minister would the Minister for Trade and Industry be if he claimed that the policy of the Government was not going to be his policy in future and said on a television interview: ‘It is going to be different because it may influence our sales to <span class="highlight">China</span>.’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who said that it would influence our sales of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been no evidence that the Ministers statement - if this is the statement that was made - has had or will have any influence on the quantity of wheat we sell to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the evidence that the statement of the Minister for Trade and Industry - which seems to me to be a perfectly sensible and principled statement - has had any influence on our possible sales to Red <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party has been made to look sufficiently ridiculous by contending that this statement, which seems to all members on this side of the House to have been perfectly sensible and responsible, will affect our sales of wheat toRed <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-50-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not place any embargo on the movement of Australian citizens to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> unless there are security considerations involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not place any obstacles in the way of the movement of people from the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to Australia unless similar kinds of security considerations are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already the Leader of the Opposition has decided that this Party would make application to the Chinese Premier,  Mr Chou  En-lai, for a visa to allow one of the members of his Party to go to Peking in order to find out why continental <span class="highlight">China</span> - the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> - is not purchasing Australian wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly - and 1 think the House will be interested in this later development - there was a request by the Australian Broadcasting Commission to permit  Mr John  Penlington to go to continental <span class="highlight">China</span>, the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, in order to permit ‘Four Corners’ to produce a film relating to that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So here we have the ABC, wishing to go to continental <span class="highlight">China</span>, being refused unless its personnel were vetted by the leading member of the Australian Communist Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, while playing politics, nonetheless likes to keep fair and proper international relationships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It concerns recent statements relating to Australia’s overseas wheat trade, this country’s defence policy and diplomatic relations with Peking <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The honourable member for Kennedy has asked the Prime Minister whether there is any similarity between our previous relationship with Russia and our present relationship with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the second case that we  are  referring to, relating to wheat, we have  a  somewhat similar problem because here the Leader of the Opposition has sent  a  message to  Mr Chou  En-lai, the Premier of continental <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: Is it a fact that the Minister for Trade and Industry is to lead a team of wheat lumpers to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to take part in a contest lumping Canadian wheat in Peking and that the Prime Minister will later lead a squash team to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a heaven-sent opportunity to enable me to give the kind of answer I have been wanting to give during the whole of question time as to our general relationship with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our trade with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, unless it comes within the strategic list or special military requirements, is free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are agreeable that sporting teams should go to <span class="highlight">China</span>, subject to security requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, it is premature in the United States’ view to consider the problem of recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> or, for that matter, to make decisions about the admission of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> into the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our attitude to admission is that, first and foremost, we want to protect the interests of Taiwan <span class="highlight">China</span> and, secondly, we want to ensure that we take it step by step and methodically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface it by saying that the Prime Minister and the  Deputy  Prime Minister have gone to great pains to say that the Government has never interfered with the Australian Wheat Board as far as political relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Does the Prime Minister deny that in May 1967 the Australian Wheat Board delegation in Hong Kong, after negotiating a contract for the sale of 1,500,000 tons of wheat with <span class="highlight">China</span>, was forced, on the instructions of the Commonwealth Government, to hand to the Chinese a note, after the contract had been signed, which stated that if <span class="highlight">China</span> did not use her influence to stop the Hong Kong riots Australia reserved the right to cancel the contract? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Prime Minister deny that the reaction by the Chinese negotiators to this blatant blackmail was so strong that the wheat trade in 1967 was almost wrecked and the next Wheat Board delegation was bluntly informed by <span class="highlight">China</span> that if such a provocative attitude by Australia continued <span class="highlight">China</span> would do no more wheat business with Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also want to point out that all this discussion on a political level is doing harm to the market for Australian wheat because if any buyer thinks that there is a weakness in the market he will of course exploit that weakness, just as the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> will, if it gets the opportunity, play politics with us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: What were the conclusions that enabled him to recognise the Taiwan government as the lawful government of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> come into existence in circumstances similar to those of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, why do we have diplomatic recognition of Russia and not of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government contemplate supporting the admission of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations on a 2-<span class="highlight">China</span> basis? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, is the right honourable gentleman aware that the Chinese Prime Minister, Chou En-lai, consistently refuses to accept the 2-<span class="highlight">China</span> formula and emphasises that his government will never surrender his country’s sovereignty, irrespective of where the political pressure comes from? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the interests of both peace and trade will the Prime Minister drop the 2-<span class="highlight">China</span> concept and try to conceive something more politically original in his search for grounds on which the Australian Government might rely to enable it officially to recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and support its admission to the United Nations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first part of it relates to the difference between the Government’s approach to the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> - that is, Taiwan <span class="highlight">China</span> - and to the People’s Republic, which I choose to call <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Continental <span class="highlight">China</span> mainly because most people do not understand unless I do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until fairly recently Continental <span class="highlight">China</span> has not shown itself particularly anxious to be recognised nor to be seated in the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For years the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, or Taiwan <span class="highlight">China</span> has been, as I have impressed on the House, a valuable member of the United Nations, has lived up to its international commitments and has been recognised by Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has to let me know whether its attitude has changed over the last few years or whether it once thought that it was wise to retain recognition of the fact that Taiwan <span class="highlight">China</span> should remain a member of the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want Continental <span class="highlight">China</span> to be a responsible member of the international community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But Australia’s overall wish is that Taiwan <span class="highlight">China</span>, which is responsible for 14 million people, should remain a member, and the Government will be working to ensure that procedures are adopted at the next United Nations meeting, or at a subsequent meeting, that will protect that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United Stales thinks that it is premature to be going along with the recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>, and it will be doing all in its power to secure the position of Taiwan <span class="highlight">China</span> in the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we accepted the presumed policy of the Australian Labor Party that we should repudiate Nationalist <span class="highlight">China</span> in favour of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> because of its greater power, does the Prime Minister believe that if we undertook this action it might well be that we would cause in the minds of the smaller nations of South East Asia with whom we have existing treaties doubt as to whether’ under the same circumstances we might well repudiate them in the future? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yesterday a series of questions was asked by Government back benchers about the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and its relations with this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had no doubt,  Mr Speaker,  that you knew that I was seeking to ask a question in relation to this matter of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel sure that if honourable members took the trouble to do this they would find that the  Speaker  of this House was indeed more than tolerant in the situation which developed when the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  was answering a question asked by the honourable member for Kennedy  (Mr Katter)  concerning wheat trade, defence policy and diplomatic relations with Peking <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chinese Government - whether it be the government of the People’s Republic of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> or Taiwan <span class="highlight">China</span> - has a very considerable degree of public order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> had been in this chamber when the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  referred to the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> as Taiwan <span class="highlight">China</span> he would obviously be offended and insulted because he does not like to have his country referred to as Taiwan <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It concerns the nature of recent communications from the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> on the possible purchase of Australian wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right honourable gentleman himself said on 6th April that the source within <span class="highlight">China</span> could not be regarded as speaking on behalf of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Prime Minister now admit to the House that the Government has received reports of 3 discussions, the first at a meeting between the British Charge d’ Affaires in Peking and a director of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and the other two at lunches between representatives of the Australian Wheat Board and officers of the <span class="highlight">China</span> Natural Resources Commission - lunches specifically sought by the Australian Wheat Board to discuss possible wheat sales? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that what we were referring to initially was an alleged statement between the British Charge d’Affaires in Peking and somebody who was not what could be regarded as a member of the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> but who was an official of one of the Chinese departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing in writing from them and this matter has come to our attention in a roundabout way and not as a direct communication from the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will recall that yesterday the Leader of the Opposition, in the course of one of his shorter questions on the <span class="highlight">China</span> issue, asserted that the credentials of the Australian Ambassador to Taipeh contained the statement that the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> was the legitimate and actual government of all and every <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition went on to assert that the Government thereby officially maintained that Taiwan <span class="highlight">China</span>, as he referred to it on that occasion, was responsible not only for the- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition did refer to the credentials of the Australian Ambassador to Taipeh and he did use the phrase that the Government of Taiwan <span class="highlight">China</span> - to adopt his term - is the legitimate and actual government of all and every <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The letters of credence themselves are from Elizabeth II to the  President  of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the words actually used are: ‘Being desirous of maintaining representation in the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> of the interests of the Commonwealth of Australia we have made choice - * There is no reference whatsoever to the words used by the Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What does the Australian Government intend by the words Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the Government in Taipeh will accept credentials only from a country which acknowledges its claim to be the government of all <span class="highlight">China</span>, including continental <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, in view of the Government’s efforts to increase trade with mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> and the loss of the wheat sales due to nonrecognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>, does the Minister consider that requests may also be made for increased Chinese migration as the basis on which that country will conduct negotiations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, what attitude will the Government take in regard to requests of this nature from mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> or any other nation similarly placed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people are in Macao, which is almost a pimple on the great body of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, the former Red <span class="highlight">China</span> or whatever terminology may be prevalent in Government circles at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the reason could not be that the ancestors of these Portuguese citizens at one time or other were attracted to the gentle flowers of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister spoke of the need to be ‘sensitive to change’ about <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One notes that 10 days after we were told that the Government is sensitive to change on <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  reverted - at the National Press Club - to the old intransigent line, and moreover did so on the very day .on which  President  Nixon announced new and quite momentous proposals towards healthier relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those taken by  Mr Trudeau  about <span class="highlight">China</span> last year are now bearing fruit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">China</span> lobby in Washington is reduced to sullen acquiescence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no reason why the Australian Government cannot achieve the same relationship with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in the same terms and under the same formula as Canada has done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is incredible that in 1971 an Australian Prime Minister should seek to gain political mileage out of kicking the Communist can in respect of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall depart from my usual practice in the case of <span class="highlight">China</span> not so much to show that I was, correct 17 years ago but to show how, entrapped and enmeshed . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certain phases of our policy have been allowed to continue for 4i years to the provocation of the people of <span class="highlight">China</span> and of all our neighbours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the question of the recognition of the Communist Government in <span class="highlight">China</span> and to its admission to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A still more serious phase, of our policy is that we say not only that the Communist Government in <span class="highlight">China</span> is not, and should not be, the Government of that country, but also, that the Nationalist Government in Formosa is, and should be, the government of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must recognise the fact that the government installed in Formosa has no chance of ever again becoming the government of <span class="highlight">China</span> unless it is enabled to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we say that that government should be the government of <span class="highlight">China</span>, we not only take an unrealistic view but a menacing one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government should have recognised the Communist government in <span class="highlight">China</span>, in view of the fact that all our neighbours, including the colonial powers, Great Britain and the Netherlands, have recognised it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government’s attitude to <span class="highlight">China</span> and Taiwan still remain as real and as pressing as they were 17 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite what the Prime Minister said this morning, Australia has been credentialled to the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> on Taiwan’s terms - that we recognise that Government as the legitimate and actual government of all and every <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister must know that  President  Chiang Kai-shek insists on being recognised as the ruler of the whole of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nothing so vividly illustrates the absurdity of our present relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> than the Government’s own confusion over communications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>situation where such gossip and such places are real factors in our communications with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the following words be added to the motion: ‘and that the Australian Government should establish diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and work for her representation in the United Nations.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Seventeen years ago we would, as I suggested at the time, have been wise to heed the views on <span class="highlight">China</span> of our Commonwealth partners in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In each of the matters I have dealt with - - <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Commonwealth, colour, colonialism - we see how this Government’s preoccupations with the policies of the past inhibit and discredit Australia’s role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our unreal and hypocritical attitude towards <span class="highlight">China</span> has been responsible for the grossest of all the violations of sound Australian policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are in the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> blood bath today because of our attitudes to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet who today would dare assert, as  Sir Robert  Menzies did 5 years ago, that our commitment in Vietnam was necessary to stop the downward thrust of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> between the Indian and Pacific Oceans? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition again implies that we should follow the Canadian view of recognition of continental <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman may deny this but a close examination of the documents and of the statements made concerning that situation shows that the Canadians were virtually committed, if Taiwan had not acted first, to withdrawing recognition from Taiwan, thus recognising the claim of continental <span class="highlight">China</span> to govern the  14.5  million people on that island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last question on which 1 should like to touch concerns <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly <span class="highlight">China</span> in history has no cause to love any of the great powers, least of all the Soviet Union which still occupies territories that <span class="highlight">China</span> regards as her own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is not entirely irrelevant that we find it difficult perhaps to decipher how much of Chinese policies would be founded in <span class="highlight">China</span>’s past and often tragic history, and how much of it would be founded in some imperial Communist ideology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But quite clearly, whatever the cause, the task of getting <span class="highlight">China</span> actively and constructively involved in world affairs will be important but difficult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But once <span class="highlight">China</span> does achieve membership of world organisations, the character of those organisations will change and not, perhaps in the short term, change for the better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It can be maintained only with skill and with tact, and I believe that lt will not be achieved by blanket opposition to continental <span class="highlight">China</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, continental <span class="highlight">China</span> could not be allowed to absorb the 14i million people in Taiwan, but so, too, the  Hi  million people in Taiwan cannot be allowed to stand in the way of dialogue and communication with the most populous country on this earth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A sudden and dramatic display of friendship to Americans by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> has evoked an almost hysterical response from  -President  Nixon and his Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since February  President  Nixon had courteously referred to this great nation as the ‘People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>’, unlike the Australian Prime Minister who persists in all the old euphemisms such as continental <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>President  Nixon announced his readiness to grant visas to visitors from <span class="highlight">China</span> and expressed his interest in visiting the People’s Republic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is worth comparing this reaction to the few minor gestures made by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Nor has there been any sign of a softening by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> on Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the week before the first American visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> the Chinese Press was full of what it saw as the victory in Laos of North Vietnam over the Saigon Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undoubtedly <span class="highlight">China</span> still regards the United States and Australia as ignoble aggressors in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>attitude to America, has told the North Vietnamese that <span class="highlight">China</span> would not shirk from the greatest national sacrifices to help them to defeat the imperialists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor is there any hint that <span class="highlight">China</span> will disengage from fostering international revolutionary activity, in particular people’s wars of liberation in Africa, Asia and Latin America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> may be changing its tactics; it has not changed its basic objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In return for a few meagre concessions <span class="highlight">China</span> has received an overwhelmingly favourable response from its most powerful adversary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beyond relations between the United States and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> lies the equally crucial issue of relations between Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> boycotted the 24th Congress of the Communist Party of Russia held in Moscow earlier this month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the very great differences between the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span>, it would be unwise to hope for any real rapprochement between <span class="highlight">China</span> and America against Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tone of resolutions adopted at the 24th Congress was that Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span> should work towards the long-term key interests of both countries and those of world socialism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only inhibition on this assistance has been the very serious division between Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span> in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To summarise these points, foreign policy in the next few years is certain to be determined by the balances between the  3  great powers - <span class="highlight">China</span>, Russia and the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any rapprochement between Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span> will present grave policy problems to the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no machinery at all for government-to-government relations between Australia and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is poised to assert itself much more positively in a region where it sees itself as unchallenged leader. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing is more certain than that Russia will become increasingly active in the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean and that <span class="highlight">China</span> will follow its lead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  &lt; has moved an amendment to the statement calling on the Australian Government to recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The immediate question we face is not that of recognition but the problem of the representation of <span class="highlight">China</span> in the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Prime Minister said in his address, there is likely to be a majority of the United Nations in favour of the admission of Continental <span class="highlight">China</span>, and a majority also who would like to find a means by which the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> on Taiwan could also retain its membership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First it should be noted that when  President  Nixon last week announced new relaxations of American restrictions on travel and trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>, he said it would be premature to talk about recognition or admission to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policies of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> affect the whole Asian region - the region in which we live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government could not accept courses of action which would leave 14 million people - more than the population of Australia itself - to face Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> without recognition Jr the support of friends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We welcome the limited thaw in <span class="highlight">China</span>’s relations with the outside world made possible by Peking’s interest in the development of personal exchanges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that the positive contribution which Peking’s recent moves have made to international understanding will lead on to equally positive adjustments in <span class="highlight">China</span>’s attitudes having a more direct bearing on inter-state relationships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Swartz)  referred in his statement to what he described as a new-found interest by the -Australian Labor Party in the recognition of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to remind the Minister that the platform of the Australian Labor Party has had as one of its fundamental planks for the last 15 years the recognition of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The deceptions, lies and myths which have been the only components of this Government’s <span class="highlight">China</span> policy are now being exposed - most tellingly by the United States Government itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, we are told, is reviewing our policy towards <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly something has been happening because since I have been in this House T have heard reference to Red <span class="highlight">China</span>, mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> and now continental <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are also hearing now prim references to <span class="highlight">China</span> as the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States is prepared to see the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> play a constructive role in the family of nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not wish to impose on <span class="highlight">China</span> an international position that denies its legitimate national interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>President Nixon went on to talk about the influence to which <span class="highlight">China</span>’s achievements entitled it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has deceived the Australian people for so long about <span class="highlight">China</span> that, clearly, it has come to believe its own propaganda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is necessary to point out that the isolation of <span class="highlight">China</span> from the international community has been largly the result of its own international attitudes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been two walls of <span class="highlight">China</span>, one built by  <span class="highlight">China</span>’s traditional insularity fortified by the dismal record of contact with the avaricious European powers in the 19th century and with Japan in the 1930s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second wall was methodically built by the United States’ to contain <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> was ringed by a series of United States bases from South Korea through Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Okinawa, South Vietnam, Thailand and earlier Pakistan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Seventh Fleet has dominated the <span class="highlight">China</span> Seas, and United States spy planes have operated at will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For too long we have reacted emotionally to massive campaigns depicting the downward thrust of <span class="highlight">China</span>, of technicolour Democratic Labor Party and Government propaganda of the Red threat oozing over South East Asia and dripping on to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What sort of sticks and stones does <span class="highlight">China</span> have? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this basis <span class="highlight">China</span> has a relatively smaller force than has any of the countries in its proximity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short in comparison with other countries <span class="highlight">China</span>’s military strength, particularly for an aggressive role, is not particularly convincing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our policy towards <span class="highlight">China</span> should not be bedevilled by a mistaken loyalty to a regime that forfeited its authority over the people of <span class="highlight">China</span> 22 years ago and which has proved incapable of earning the loyalty of the Taiwanese people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the postwar settlements as foreshadowed in the Cairo Declaration of 1st December 1943 Taiwan was returned to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>General Wedemeyer in his report on his mission to <span class="highlight">China</span> dated 17th August had this to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only 10 per cent of the National Assembly of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> are Taiwanese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But it is absurd to suggest that the present position should be supported by Australia to the detriment of our relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The regime in Taiwan by its own decision has broken off relations with Canada because it continues to insist that those who have diplomatic relations with it recognise it as the Government of all of <span class="highlight">China</span> - a mistaken impression that the Prime Minister continued to perpetuate in statements he made in the House today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Malaysian Government, despite the misleading information that the Prime Minister has given in the past to this House, has stated that it regards the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> as the legitimate government of all <span class="highlight">China</span>, including Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should move toward, first, the recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>; secondly, the representation of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in the United Nations; and thirdly, resolving the political future of the peoples of Taiwan, lt would pay us well to keep in mind the words of a very great Foreign Secretary pf the United Kingdom in the 19th century, Lord Palmerston. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>The United States believed initially that by recognising the Government of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, which is now on Taiwan, it could have the ideological advantage of a transformation within <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Soviet Union’s objection to <span class="highlight">China</span> was that <span class="highlight">China</span> was raising the question of the 600,000 square miles of Chinese territory annexed by the czars after 1858 and was raising the kind of ideological issues which are a potential dissolvent of the Soviet Union, whether Georgians, Ukranians or others would continue or wish to continue to be subordinate to the White Russians in what is a vast colonial empire of the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The revolutionary anti-colonialist principles of <span class="highlight">China</span> are a potential dissolvent of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union has 3 million troops along the borders of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>even begin to assess Chinese policy, and the ridiculous debates in this House because the Government can get the preferences of the Democratic Labor Party by yak-yak-yak about Red <span class="highlight">China</span> are a disgrace to this Parliament and would be unacceptable in a high school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole position of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> is not analysed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> was purely interested in nationalist issues why does it not occupy Hong Kong and Macao? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Fremantle concentrated to a large extent on the issues involved in recognising continental <span class="highlight">China</span> and on the current very unfortunate situation in East Pakistan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In more recent times continental <span class="highlight">China</span>, to use the title in- vogue ai the moment, has earned a reputation for encouraging instability and subversion in the region and, in the case of Tibet and India, committing actual aggression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I return now to the subject of continental <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A quite remarkable change in her attitude is revealed by- such recent events as the invitation to the American table tennis team to visit <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> in, I think, 1961. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But during the cultural revolution and for some time afterwards it is well known that continental <span class="highlight">China</span> virtually cut herself off from the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During this period continental <span class="highlight">China</span> suffered severe setbacks in her efforts to influence countries in Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, <span class="highlight">China</span> often had to choose between supporting the existing government of a country or revolutionary forces within the same country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time as all this was going on, continental <span class="highlight">China</span> was of course also supporting the North Vietnamese in the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In about 1968 there were discernible signs that <span class="highlight">China</span> wanted to regain her rapidly declining influence, but to do this her foreign policy tactic had to change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question is: If - and I stress the word ‘if - the assessment that <span class="highlight">China</span> has changed her attitude is correct, what has brought it about? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that had been, would continental <span class="highlight">China</span> have had any reason to re-assess her aggressive, subversive and disruptive policies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is true that continental <span class="highlight">China</span> is moving towards a desire to become a part of the community of nations, and if she has finally realised that the policies which she has been following are preventing this because they are not acceptable to the great majority of countries, the implications are tremendous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quite agree that it is far too early yet to assume with any degree of confidence that continental <span class="highlight">China</span> has abandoned or even modified her previous policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, how will continental <span class="highlight">China</span> exploit her growing nuclear power? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to speak briefly about <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot keep trailing behind American policy on <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we see a change in American policy on <span class="highlight">China</span>, Australia must be the first to get out - not to follow the United States but to lead it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very interesting to consider the environment in which the original policy of military and diplomatic isolation of <span class="highlight">China</span> evolved and to see some of the justifications on which this policy of separation of <span class="highlight">China</span> from the world community was based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very interesting to note that, in the early 1950s, policy towards <span class="highlight">China</span> was not created by the United States on a rational basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the government in Peking was in effect the government of <span class="highlight">China</span>, it should be recognised as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But these views were crushed beneath the weight of McCarthyism within the United States and a policy of diplomatic and military isolation of <span class="highlight">China</span> was introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the aims of this policy of isolation were to bring about a breakdown within <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This policy was aimed at denying <span class="highlight">China</span> its rights and recognition as a great power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was aimed at continuing the civil war in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This policy was aimed also at preventing the expansion of Russian power because, interestingly enough, in the early 1950s, the official American view in this environment of antiCommunism was that <span class="highlight">China</span> was in fact merely an extension of Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was Dean Rusk who went on record - and who for years later regretted saying it - that <span class="highlight">China</span> was in fact not <span class="highlight">China</span> but a ‘Russian Manchukuo’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy of isolation and containment of <span class="highlight">China</span> was aimed also at modifying <span class="highlight">China</span>’s aggressiveness and changing its outlook towards the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the spread of Communism is concerned, it is hard to see any gain that Communism has made anywhere in the world as extensive as the gains that it has achieved in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor has the isolation of <span class="highlight">China</span> taken place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the whole reason why the Government is beginning now to rethink its policy, although the burden of the argument on the other side has been denied, has been the fact that <span class="highlight">China</span> now is gaining the numbers in the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to that, Australia has trade relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> and is only one of a very large number of nations that recognise the reality that <span class="highlight">China</span> is a nation that buys and sells. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Kai-shek that he rules all <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to start talking common sense, we must recognise that the Government of Peking is the de facto government of the mainland of <span class="highlight">China</span> and that there is nothing that we or anybody else in the word can do to change that situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am particularly concerned about this problem for the reason that the United Nations can never deal properly with the main issues of world peace while <span class="highlight">China</span> is refused admission to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing which is very interesting in the case of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the United Nations is the view that has been taken by the Indian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in the 1960s there was serious trouble between India and <span class="highlight">China</span>, India nevertheless has maintained the view consistently that it should continue diplomatic relations with the Chinese and should continue to press for the granting of legitimate rights to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our support for the restoration of the rights of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is based on the principles of the universality of our Organisation as also on the provisions of the Charter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, there is a general recognition that without the rightful participation of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> this Organisation will continue to face difficulties in solving several basic problems.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to have a rational world in which all nations will be enabled to carry out their obligations as members of a comity of nations it is absolutely essential that <span class="highlight">China</span> should be in the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should recognise one fact: The Government of <span class="highlight">China</span> is here to stay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He spoke mainly on Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Middle East and Pakistan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  saw fit to move a very carefully worded amendment about <span class="highlight">China</span> - I say this because he made no reference to Taiwan - I thought I might speak about the South East Asian area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we talk about South East Asia it would be a cardinal sin to omit looking at troubles that have arisen and been caused in the past as a result of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition commented that Australia is involved in the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> bloodbath today because of our attitude to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition referred also to Canada’s recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not suggesting this as a reason for Canadian recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span> or the policies it has adopted towards <span class="highlight">China</span> but this is something which has never been mentioned in this House by any member of the Opposition and I believe it is a factor which cannot be dismissed out of hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very pertinent to remind the House that the isolation of the great nation of <span class="highlight">China</span> in the last 20 years has been brought about by its own doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> has isolated itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Government has defended its refusal to grant recognition to <span class="highlight">China</span> and to approve its membership of the United Nations on the grounds that it had to defend the rights of 14i million Taiwanese,  Mr Fraser  totally reversed the argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, continental <span class="highlight">China</span> could not be allowed to absorb the 144 million people in Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Why has Australia taken a different approach towards Ceylon from that which she took towards India at the time of her conflict with <span class="highlight">China</span> and towards Cambodia last year when the Government made special assistance available without cost? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would it be possible for Trade Commissioner services to be extended to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When did the last trade mission from the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> visit Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of setting up a trade post in the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is a policy matter and one which I do not intend to discuss here today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know of no officers of my Department having gone to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contact may have been made with the <span class="highlight">China</span> Resources Board in <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the policy of the Government has been that any trade arrangements with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> have been made on an industry basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who are the greatest advocates of contact with Red <span class="highlight">China</span> are the greatest opponents of South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the same argument that they use in favour of talking to Red <span class="highlight">China</span> not work in relation to talking to the South Africans? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not matter about kicking the Communist can in this sense, because the arguments they have put forward in support of their association with Red <span class="highlight">China</span> and with all other Communist nations must be held to be firm also in their associations with South Africa and these other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He made an insulting speech tonight when he accused honourable members on this side of the House over their actions in relation to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although his attitudes towards <span class="highlight">China</span> later changed, he at no time moved away from the opinion he held at the time he made that statement that <span class="highlight">China</span> was a great nation of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, the country that honourable members opposite have been championing tonight, she would have had her head chopped off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have heard from Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> - or Red <span class="highlight">China</span> or continental <span class="highlight">China</span> as the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  calls it - that it proposes not to buy any more Australian wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I consider the aspects of wheat sales is a valid one because of the situation in the Middle East and the fact that the Country Party has been caught on the hook with <span class="highlight">China</span> and has to carry over 260 million bushels of wheat from last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wanted to talk about <span class="highlight">China</span> and a few other things which are most important to the international wheat trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where are the written facts which the Prime Minister promised me by a deadline of the middle of this week, which is noon today - high noon, if he likes - regarding the serious allegations that I made concerning the Government’s most offensive policy note handed to <span class="highlight">China</span> via the Wheat Board? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, which has nuclear power, and what has to be remembered is that in no circumstances would Japan bc able to engage in operations that involved nuclear warfare against that country, because Japan is so small in area that a few thermo-nuclear bombs would immediately destroy all of its productive capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The members of that branch realise, of course, that recognition of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> could play a significant part in solving the wheat problem, and I would hope that other branches with the same views would make them known to the Government as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In one or two cases, such as with footwear and the machine tools industry, recommendations have been made by our tariff-making authorities to increase the tariff and so put an impediment in the way of goods coming from that country but this applied to other countries as well as to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More will be said about <span class="highlight">China</span> in the foreign affairs debate this session, but let me say just this: I believe his visit compromised discussions which the Australian Wheat Board was just about to begin with the Chinese when he announced his intention to go to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710817_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is confidence laeking because we are reducing our troop commitment in Vietnam in accordance with developments there, or because of the efforts we are mak ing, through proper means, to normalise relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, or because we have liberalised our trading arrangements with <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710817_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately, 1 have not got time to explain it, but while I happened to be in New Zealand the Opposition tried to accuse me of being the reason for our lack of sales of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>, because of what I had said on television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710817_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Beyond the immediate threats within and against Vietnam there was a militant <span class="highlight">China</span> - a <span class="highlight">China</span> which was giving direct moral and material aid to North Vietnam and which had in the recent past occupied Tibet and fought with India, a <span class="highlight">China</span> whose ambitions and policies in the area were causing great concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Government’s earnest hope that the war can be brought to an early end by serious negotiations, that peace and stability will soon prevail throughout the area, and that the countries of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> - not excluding North Vietnam - will be able to devote their energies with the help of others to worthwhile productive efforts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me put 2 questions to the right honourable gentleman: Is <span class="highlight">China</span> weaker or stronger in the world today because of Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The significance for our region is this: After Korea, particularly after the Geneva Agreements, it would have been possible for us to bring <span class="highlight">China</span> back into the comity of nations and to break down that mutual hostility and phobia of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would never have been in Vietnam had it not been for the mutual hostility and suspicion between the United States and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us seize the opportunity now to get rational, peaceful and fruitful relations between all the great powers in the Pacific - <span class="highlight">China</span> and the United States, Japan and the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> had only recently gone into Tibet and had gone to war with India. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the relations between the US and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> will mean a lessening of Communist aggression in South Vietnam and indeed throughout the whole of South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I sincerely hope, as I am sure every honourable member hopes, that the improved relations between the US and <span class="highlight">China</span> will contribute to an easing of the tension in South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although many of the matters that we will discuss are parts of an iceberg above the surface, I think that below the surface between these 2 countries there is a basic fear on the part of Pakistan that India has never really accepted its right to exist, and there is a basic fear on the part of India that Pakistan is consenting to being used as an instrument of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> to break up the unity of India. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government of Pakistan is an ally of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is probable that the visit of  President  Nixon to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> and the fact that the United States has allowed arms to go to Pakistan is the cause of India abandoning its non-alignment and becoming a Soviet ally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those who want to make points about Communism, Bhutto, who is one of the architects of this policy in the West, is completely sympathetic to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not only a humanitarian question, but it is a provocation towards a war - a provocation towards a war in which both the Soviet Union and Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> might intervene if it is launched. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In discussing political initiatives we have to measure Australia’s size and strength in the field in which we are operating, in a matter which includes India, Pakistan, Soviet Russia, the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I need only say at this stage that I believe the Prime Minister’s announcement last night will do more to normalise relations between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span> than will the statement which we are debating now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I add that for advisers from Australia or other countries to remain in Indo <span class="highlight">China</span> would be another breach of the Geneva Agreements of 1954. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My remaining comment on matters other than <span class="highlight">China</span> and Japan which were contained in the Minister’s statement would be to mention that I think that for the first time a Minister for Foreign Affairs, or as previously was the case a Minister for External Affairs, has made a ministerial statement without referring to Britain or to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to the questions of <span class="highlight">China</span> and Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The stumbling-block then to recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span> by Australia and the admission of <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations was <span class="highlight">China</span>’s conduct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of <span class="highlight">China</span> has become of great moment in Australia this year because of trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have learned to our cost that the biggest wheat market we had has been lost to us because Australia does not recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that we did for very many years throughout the 1960s sell wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> without recognising her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Canada also sold wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> without recognising her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> would take the natural, sensible attitude that if she wants a product enough she will get it where she can best get it and the two most appropriate sources in quantity, price- and location were Australia and Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that Australia was marginally more hostile to <span class="highlight">China</span> - to use the Chinese term - than was Canada in that from the middle 1960s onward Australia had troops in Vietnam and an embassy in Taipei whereas Canada had neither. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do sell quite an amount of manufactures, including strategic goods, to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd sells to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular an Australian company which is a subsidiary or an associate of an American company would be most unlikely to get any orders in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, an Australian company which is a subsidiary or an associate of a Japanese company with interests, trade and investments in Taiwan would be most unlikely to get orders from <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly any Australian subsidiaries or associates of those friendly companies could readily trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us face the fact that, despite the disclaimer by the latest Foreign Minister on this subject, trade has made <span class="highlight">China</span>’s status of immediate interest to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The predominant reason why we should be interested in <span class="highlight">China</span> and in her recognition and admission is the fact that the Vietnam war is almost over and we now have an opportunity of having rational relations among the countries surrounding the Pacific Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One was that the Australian Labor Party’s delegation had compromised the wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> and the other was that it had compromised the first moves that we - meaning the Australian Government - were making through diplomatic channels to open up a dialogue with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first allegation is sufficiently answered by pointing out that as we arrived in Canton we met Monsieur JeanLuc Pepin, the Canadian Minister for Trade, leaving <span class="highlight">China</span>.. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He had just come from Peking after signing a communique establishing first consideration in wheat sales for <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, we had our conversations with the Acting Foreign Minister of <span class="highlight">China</span> on 4th July and with the Prime Minister of <span class="highlight">China</span> on the night of 5th July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian officials have held fruitless talks with representatives of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister of <span class="highlight">China</span> had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So Australia had been compromised before we ever spoke to anybody in authority in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My own visit to Japan and the Philippines after the <span class="highlight">China</span> mission confirms me in my belief that Australia is uniquely well placed to improve relations between <span class="highlight">China</span>, the United States, Japan and Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is open to any Australian Government, even the McMahon Government, to normalise relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party supports the formula agreed on between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Canada, and shortly afterwards agreed on between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Italy and several other nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 13th October last year the Governments of Canada and <span class="highlight">China</span> announced that they were going to exchange diplomatic representatives and their joint communique proceeded in these words: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chinese Government reaffirms, that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Territory of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Canadian Government recognises the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> as the sole legal government of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said to Prime Minister Sato, who did not dissent, the greatest diplomatic task facing Japan, demanding all her skill and patience, is normalising her relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> in the light of the special difficulty raised by her treaty with Chiang <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should say to Japan that we accept her commitment was a personal one to Chiang Kaishek and that she has fully and honourably discharged whatever obligation she may have fell in that quarter; Japan is now entitled to pursue her own interests, which require a restoration of elations between her and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that I have more time in which to speak than I had anticipated, thanks to the indulgence of the House, I shall go at greater length into the reasons behind the Japanese difficulties with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difficulties between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Japan are much greater than those between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a history of hostility between the United States and <span class="highlight">China</span> for 22 years; that is all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With all other great powers <span class="highlight">China</span>’s relations have been worse than they have been with America but with Japan in particular there have been hostile relations since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> is still extremely suspicious of any interest which Japan takes in Korea, which was detached from Chinese suzerainty in that war, and in Taiwan which was taken from Chinese sovereignty in that war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia were not represented at the San Francisco Peace Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> was not represented because those who were at San Francisco could not agree which was the Government of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation technically is that not only is Japan still in a state of war with the Soviet Union but she is still also in a state of war with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if one accepts the legitimacy or the legality of the treaty of 1952 one still has the situation that there is a state of war between Japan and all of <span class="highlight">China</span> except the province of Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would point out that until I returned from <span class="highlight">China</span> very few people in this country - very few editorial writers and very few pundits - realised that the term ‘province’ is applied to Taiwan by both Chiang Kai-shek and Chou En-lai. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(<span class="highlight">China</span> certainly repudiates any such concept of it now.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lastly, the Japanese government believed that the Communist regime in <span class="highlight">China</span> is backing the Japan Communist Party in its programme of seeking violently to overthrow the constitutional system and the present Government of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Nowadays one of the most constant critics of the Government of <span class="highlight">China</span> is the Japan Communist Party.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps I should speak briefly on the difficulty between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> resents Russia’s attitude because she is the only nation which still holds to the unequal treaties concluded in the 1860s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the other countries which imposed unequal treaties on <span class="highlight">China</span> have abandoned those treaties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Russia is anxious to conclude a border agreement with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> is very patient on the question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> is realistic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chiang Kai-shek has frequently criticised Peking for yielding <span class="highlight">China</span>’s territory, above all Mongolia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, we should accept the view of Chiang Kai-shek, and the view of all the other Chinese that I have heard speak on the subject, that there is only one <span class="highlight">China</span>, and that Taiwan is a province of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor is there dispute between them on any of the other matters which are frequently thrown up against the Chinese Government, namely, questions of offshore islands, fishing rights, the ocean sub soil, the seabed, the continental shelf, Tibet and the <span class="highlight">China</span>-India border - to use the historic  term,  the McMahon line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, 1 put it that we should accept the view of President Nixon that diplomatic relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> must be normalised as speedily as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one accepts the situation that the sole legal government of <span class="highlight">China</span> is in Peking and not in Taipeh, then one transfers from Taipeh to Peking the Australian Embassy to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition in Canada, the Conservative Leader, visited <span class="highlight">China</span> the week after we did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It knows that the British on a bi-partisan basis agree that they should withdraw their consuls if they are to have full diplomatic representation in <span class="highlight">China</span> and from <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday the Minister for Foreign Affairs put the proposition for 2 Chinas or for <span class="highlight">China</span> and one Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> both claim to be the sole government of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have taken the view, therefore, that in present circumstances the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> should both be represented in the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, it might be said that because <span class="highlight">China</span> is divided there should be representation in the United Nations for each of the parts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are going to use these different arguments for 2 Chinas let us at least be consistent about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AH the arguments appear completely ingenuous and completely insincere when we realise that the realistic situation on <span class="highlight">China</span> has only been realised 22 years after it came about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the climate of opinion on the <span class="highlight">China</span> question in America has recently undergone a startling thorough change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The influence of the notorious <span class="highlight">China</span> Lobby’ which backs Chiang Kai-shek has waned and support for a more realistic diplomacy has correspondingly waxed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is to say, the situation in America which has exercised the strongest influence on Australia’s <span class="highlight">China</span> policy has radically changed, lt may, in fact, fairly be supposed that an Australian decision to recognise Red <span class="highlight">China</span> would now be welcomed in Washington as a further argument for a realignment of American Far Eastern policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, an Australian gesture at this delicate stage in Asia could carry considerable weight, not only in Peking but also in the capitals of those Asian powers which, while friendly towards this country, have been bewildered by our continued refusal to face facts on <span class="highlight">China</span>, lt is surely plain that there can be no satisfactory or lasting settlement in the Far East white an emigre government of <span class="highlight">China</span> enjoys Western support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the other quotation from a distinguished diplomat because one of the disturbing things for Australia is the extent to which the morale and the reputation of our Department of Foreign Affairs and all the skills assembled there should have been committed bv its political masters to such time consuming, futile and discreditable exercises as justifying our attitude on New Guinea and justifying our attitude on <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My own choice as best for Australia’s security in the long run would be, in spite of all the difficulties at the beginning, to strive for a modus vivendi and for friendship with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This does not mean a cut-and-dried choice between America and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And be that as it may, not only is it unrealistic to treat Taiwan as the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, it is  a  most perilous form of unrealism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our opening an Embassy in Taiwan In 1966 to the so-called Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, after resisting pressures to do so for 16 years, an off-the-curT decision made, without consulting the Department of External Affairs or, apparently, the Minister for External Affairs, by the Prime Minister of the day, himself an amiable man whom no one could dislike but who knew almost nothing about foreign affairs, was as foolish as  it  was naive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 need only add that since that was written it has become clear that there will not be a war between America and <span class="highlight">China</span> on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In particular we must normalise relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How many Australians have any knowledge at all of <span class="highlight">China</span>’.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a habit which will lead us in our international relations to what is so much required, to lower the voice, to de-dramatise, to be patient and to feel suitably foolish when political cheapjacks, however highly placed for the moment, talk as they have talked in the past, about ‘getting tough with <span class="highlight">China</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would like to have moved an amendment to the motion to take note of the Minister’s statement, but we already have on the notice paper such an amendment on the statement by the immediate past Foreign Minister, in the terms that the Australian Government should establish diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and work for her representation to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to say something about the recent visit of the Leader of the Opposition to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> was conceived in sin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The presence of the honourable member for Dawson  (Dr Patterson)  in the Australian Labor Party delegation that visited <span class="highlight">China</span> supports what I say about the purpose of the visit - that it was conceived in sin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In going to <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Leader of the Opposition might more usefully have explained the fears that <span class="highlight">China</span>’s neighbours have of her aggressive words and actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would have been more useful if the Leader of the Opposition had explained in Peking that <span class="highlight">China</span>’s neighbours have some good reasons for their suspicions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of agreeing with everything that  Mr Chou  En-lai had to say, he might have had some regard for the objectives of our allies and in particular for  President  Nixon in his bargaining with Peking in his forecast visit to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are trying to sell wool to the Russians just as the Leader of the Opposition was in <span class="highlight">China</span> to sell wheat to that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the end of my speech I may ask for leave of the House to table a document from the Parliamentary Library setting out quite factually what has happened to the trade of those countries that have or have not had diplomatic relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I want to say that we now have to reappraise our relations, not only with <span class="highlight">China</span> but also with other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The detente between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the United State may be regarded by Japan as a rebuff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Japan may either go in with <span class="highlight">China</span> in an economic entente, despite words, or she may go in with the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must re-assess our position with regard to Great Britain, the United States, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Japan and the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to <span class="highlight">China</span>, there is no disagreement that the Australian Government should seek to normalise diplomatic relations, but that falls a long way short of the sort of vassalage that the Leader of the Opposition has been presenting to this House, and the cautious approach of the Government to this matter, I believe, is to be commended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Bradfield  (Mr Turner)  maintains that the Australian Labor Party mission to <span class="highlight">China</span> was conceived in sin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It indicates why our image overseas, particularly in Asia, is so poor and why we have lost the $100m wheat trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, just consider the names by which it used to call <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone on the Government side of the chamber called it Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then it was Red <span class="highlight">China</span>, and then suddenly the Prime Minister woke up to the fact that he must not use those words because the United States of America was not using those words any more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then it became continental <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then it became mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> and now, of course, it is the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, of course, the Australian Government claims that I am telling lies, it is also accusing the Foreign Minister for <span class="highlight">China</span>, Chi-Peng Fei, and the Minister for Foreign Trade, Pai Hsiang Kuo, of telling lies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister still insults the people of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The editorial in the Age’ condemned the Minister for Shipping and Transport for his absurd statements overseas regarding <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us look a little at what <span class="highlight">China</span> thinks of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chinese view is that the war should be ended immediately so that the people of Vietnam and Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> can solve their own problems immediately, without interference from the United States or Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ministers of the Chinese Government maintain, as we well know, that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is the sole legal government of <span class="highlight">China</span> and that Taiwan is an unalienable part of <span class="highlight">China</span> - a province of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the only policy acceptable to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was made crystal clear that <span class="highlight">China</span> is opposed to the creation of 2 Chinas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told, again in blunt terms, that if Australia is not clear on this there will be serious difficulties in the establishment of normal relations between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was made clear also that <span class="highlight">China</span> will have, and is prepared to have, peaceful co-existence with Australia despite the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>different political systems and social systems if the Taiwan situation is solved - that is, that there is only one <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chinese policy with regard to relationships with <span class="highlight">China</span> is that good relations cannot exist between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Australia as long as the Australian Government continues its hostil ity towards <span class="highlight">China</span> and tails the United States aggression in Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another point the Chinese made was that the present poor relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> have not been caused by <span class="highlight">China</span> and therefore an initiative must come from the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chinese view is that it is not possible to have normal relations with the Australian Government while the Australian Government openly supports Chiang Kai-shek, continues to establish close relations with him, opposes <span class="highlight">China</span> in the United Nations and supports United States resolutions to exclude <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 2 Chinas policy is clearly unworkable in terms of logic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> will not take a seat in the United Nations if Taiwan is also represented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> as a nation is already a member of the United Nations and the basic question confronting the Australian Government and the United Nations is: Which Government of <span class="highlight">China</span> is the sole legal government of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, Taiwan is recognised by both Chiang Kai-shek and Chou En-lai as a province of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, if the United Nations were able to get Taiwan in first, <span class="highlight">China</span> would not go in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> were admitted first as a member of the Security Council, it would veto the entry of Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 2 Chinas policy is completely unworkable and the People’s Republic will not accept it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both governments agree that there is only one <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An example of the serious repercussions of this 2 Chinas policy can be seen with respect to a problem which is already boiling in that area over Senkaku and Tiaoyutai islands near Okinawa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Japan claims them, Taiwan claims them and Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> claims them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nationalist <span class="highlight">China</span> has records dating back to the 15th century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> agrees with Taiwan but makes the point that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is, in fact, the sole and legal government of <span class="highlight">China</span> not Chiang Kai-shek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because of the Australian Government’s open hostility to <span class="highlight">China</span> the Australian people and the Australian economy have suffered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have lost a major wool market in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The wheat farmers and wool growers of this nation do not owe this Government any thanks for its ostrich-like approach to the realities of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it comes to the next election this Government will see very quickly what the wheat farmers and woof growers think of its foreign policy on <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Dawson  (Dr Patterson)  devoted much of his speech to the alleged loss of Australian wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span>, but I remind the honourable member that the Australian Wheat Board recently announced that the current carryover will be the lowest for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the message which is now getting across to the people of Australia following the visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  and the Australian Labor Party delegation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a long way to <span class="highlight">China</span>, but the longest ride that the Leader of the Opposition and his Party got was not on the way over - it was right there in Peking, and they did not have to move a foot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real issue of the performance of the Leader of the Opposition in <span class="highlight">China</span> is not whether we should or should not trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> or hold discussions with <span class="highlight">China</span>, but how his visit there will affect Australia’s relations not only or even primarily with <span class="highlight">China</span>, but with the rest of our trade associates, our friends and our allies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to remember the trade figures between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span> and the other countries of Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1966 our exports to <span class="highlight">China</span> have varied between $l28m and $63m a year, and over the 5 years totalled $5 lim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our imports from <span class="highlight">China</span> during the same period totalled $143m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his extraordinary anxiety to please <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Leader of the Opposition completely ignored the fact that our trade with our Asian friends is far more important to us and, incidentally, far more stable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A study of the record will show that once a country has recognised <span class="highlight">China</span>, her trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> has generally declined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, as was mentioned by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Bradfield  (Mr Turner),  once <span class="highlight">China</span> has achieved her objective, once she has succeeded in getting a country to take the bait of recognition, trade declines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not opposing any move towards increased trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trade is one way of preventing <span class="highlight">China</span> from becoming isolated from the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one way of retaining an avenue where <span class="highlight">China</span> may eventually come to realise the folly and danger of her present course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me return to the Leader of the Opposition and his <span class="highlight">China</span> foray. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition made the interesting comment that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics had treated <span class="highlight">China</span> abominably. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That may very well be so, and it would apply not only to <span class="highlight">China</span>, but I cannot help wondering how the Leader of the Opposition would describe <span class="highlight">China</span>’s treatment of Tibet, and how he would describe <span class="highlight">China</span>’s treatment of India; but we must be left to wonder because there is no indication of how he would describe it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we do know is that in the field of international diplomacy the Leader of the Opposition has been found wanting to such an extent that if he were ever in a position to speak for this country on the question of <span class="highlight">China</span>, he would find himself and Australia without bargaining power, without any cards left to play. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is almost as if he believed that <span class="highlight">China</span>’s interests and our own were identical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to the House that <span class="highlight">China</span>’s recent history gives us no confidence for such a view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Everyone recognises that <span class="highlight">China</span> is a great power and that she will exert increasing influence throughout the world, and particularly in Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accepting this fact, by all means let us try to ensure that <span class="highlight">China</span> becomes one of the community of nations, but do not let us blind ourselves to <span class="highlight">China</span>’s recent history of interference and sometimes active aggression in the affairs of other countries, such as Korea, Tibet, India and Burma. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Maoists’ utterances and their actions lead one to note that Mao’s projected ‘Super Reich’ would include, in addition to <span class="highlight">China</span> itself, Korea, the Mongolian People’s Republic, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia, Malaysia, Burma and various other countries in this region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He is a Russian journalist of considerable prestige and, if honourable members opposite did a bit of research work themselves, they would find that he has had a longer and wider experience in <span class="highlight">China</span> than any other senior Soviet journalist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is a man who has been reading and writing about and visiting <span class="highlight">China</span> over many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So let us be under no delusion when we talk or negotiate with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We sincerely hope that the recent initiative is an indication of a willingness on <span class="highlight">China</span>’s part to modify and perhaps to change the direction of its policies which it has followed in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interests of this country are not best served by adopting an obsequious, subservient attitude to <span class="highlight">China</span>, trying to insinuate ourselves, as the honourable member for Bradfield said, into <span class="highlight">China</span>’s good graces by gratuitously insulting our friends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But can he say that Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>’s influence is less now than it was in 1965 when we sent our forces or in 1954 because now, at a time when United States  prestige throughout Asia is at its lowest ebb, Communist Chinese prestige is at its highest? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the point is that through our misdirected desire to ensure the reimposition of the French empire in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> in 1945 and the United States assumption of the French role in 1954 we effectively stopped the evolution of an Indo-Chinese solution to an Indo-Chinese problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is an old Persian saying that only your own fingers can find the itch, and it is about time that we let the people of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> resolve their own problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we are talking about the change of policy in relation to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, while I do not oppose talking to the Chinese I would remind the House and the people of Australia that the late Neville Chamberlain went over to talk to Hitler but it did not make much difference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although nuclear armament may change the direction of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s strategic thinking, it is not impossible that a nuclear umbrella could give Peking greater confidence in promoting revolutionary war on the periphery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to make a brief comment on Australia’s wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was in that area in the early days when the United Kingdom recognised Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No longer did <span class="highlight">China</span> need the UK. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The UK had done what <span class="highlight">China</span> wanted and the Communist Chinese literally ignored the UK and insulted that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  were to visit <span class="highlight">China</span>, as a group from the Opposition side did, and tell the Chinese that you know that they will not buy your wheat unless you recognise them would this not put into their hands the very weapon with which to destroy the economic and financial situation of Australia in this sphere? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of them is the two <span class="highlight">China</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not possible for Government supporters, psychologically, mentally or intellectually, to adjust to the new opportunities for peaceful relations in the world such as  President  Nixon’s statesmanlike intention to visit <span class="highlight">China</span> has opened to us in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to put forward my views as to why I think  President  Nixon’s intention to visit <span class="highlight">China</span> is so constructive, so valuable and so laudable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not surprising because after all, in the wheat electorates in this nation there has been a tremendous uproar against the rigidity of this Government’s policies and the disastrous effects they have had on our wheat trading with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, let us have a look at the size of the trade that Australia has had in wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From 1960 to 1970 Australia sold 743 million bushels to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no wonder that so many Government supporters are trying to put up such a smokescreen of fear and horror about the new policy towards <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the value of the trade that this Government has lost to this country because of its policy towards <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard some rather remarkable statements about what the Leader of the Opposition’s visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> has done and how it set the dominoes tumbling and caused Australia to be cast alone in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was rather intrigued by the things he had to say about  Mr Whitlam’s  visit to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Walsh,  in part of his question about trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>, said to  Mr Anthony: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wouldn’t criticise  Mr Whitlam’s  visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> on purely political grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  attack is not very convincing, because the Australian people have been genuinely and thoroughly impressed by the initiative that the Leader of the Opposition took in going to <span class="highlight">China</span>, not merely to regain the trade that  the  Government has so disastrously lost but to build bridges of understanding between this country and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the Government’s attitude on the whole question of our relations and the United States relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that an era of new relationships between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the United States had been opened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>President  Nixon is going to <span class="highlight">China</span> and he is adopting a policy which virtually discredits and discards the policies that this Government has pursued for 20 years, of rigid containment and isolation of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me give my views now on  President  Nixon’s visit to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very disturbed by the fact that we can have in this House an official statement which welcomes  President  Nixon’s visit but the visit can then then be attacked, virtually, with the sort of arguments that Government members have used so far and will go on using week in week out, kicking the Communist can and deliberately creating a mentality of fear which is the very contrary to what  President  Nixon is trying to do in his initiatives with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These parties are deeply suspicious of  President  Nixon’s attempts to bring about peace, security and stability in the world through understanding with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see 3 principal reasons for President Nixon’s visit to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one of the realities behind President Nixon’s policy towards <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will spend some time quoting from this document because I regard it as a most important indication of where President Nixon’s policy is taking the United States, where it is taking <span class="highlight">China</span> and where it is taking us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> is, of course, a very different situation - from Russia - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First in terms of its economic capacity at the present time, a pretty good indication of where it is, is that Japan, with 100 million people, produces more than Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> with 800 million people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, any sense of satisfaction that it will always be that way, because when we see the Chinese people - and I have seen them all over the world, and some of you have, too, whether in Hong Kong or Thailand or Singapore or Bangkok, any of the great cities, Manila, where Chinese are there - they are creative, they are productive, they are one of the most capable people in the world, and 800 million Chinese are going to be, inevitably, an enormous economic power, with all that means in terms of what they could be in other areas if they move in that direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the reason why 1 felt that it was essential that this administration take the first steps toward ending the isolation of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> from the world community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was about a week before he announced his visit to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at least the doors must be opened and the goal of US policy must be in the long term, ending the isolation of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, and a normalisation of our relations with Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> because, looking down the road, and let’s just look ahead IS to 20 years, the United States could have a perfectly effective agreement with the Soviet Union for limitation of arms - the danger of any confrontation there - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, outside the world community, completely isolated, with its leaders not in communication with world leaders, would be a danger to the whole world that would be unacceptable, unacceptable to us and unacceptable to others, as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said more, but what I have quoted shows Australia that the policies which the United States has pursued towards <span class="highlight">China</span> for 20 years, that is, policies of military containment of the Chinese and diplomatic isolation, are no longer to be followed in the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These bitternesses between the United States and <span class="highlight">China</span> have incinerated Korea and Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Bendigo  (Mr Kennedy)  would seem to give the House the view that there have been no discussions and no attempts to negotiate with <span class="highlight">China</span> over the last 20 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member further forgets that the one significant strategic difference between the situation that then prevailed and that which is now beginning to emerge is <span class="highlight">China</span>’s growing fear of the Soviet Union which makes <span class="highlight">China</span> look outward to see what other relationships she might form and what changes she might be able to make in her connections with other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, provided people like the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  keep out of the ring in this particular context, the United States has a very clear weapon in its hand in trying to negotiate sensible solutions to some of the problems with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the waters are muddied, if the pass is sold long before the negotiations with the  President  and <span class="highlight">China</span> begin in earnest, there will be no chance of that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> he repudiated Australia’s old friends and alliances, lt was Professor Arndt who, in resigning from the Australian Labor Party, said that this entirely distinguishes the approach of the Leader of the Opposition from that of President Nixon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>President Nixon is trying to bring <span class="highlight">China</span> within the ambit of nations and to normalise relationships with <span class="highlight">China</span> but at the same time preserving those other relationships, friendships and alliances which need preservation with other countries in this part of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His endorsement of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s policies in relation to South East Asia and East Asia has won endorsement by Chou En-lai as the next candidate for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But has anyone raised any objection to <span class="highlight">China</span>’s endorsement of  Mr Whitlam’s  candidacy for the Prime Ministership at the next elections? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition went to <span class="highlight">China</span> to try to do something about wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He soon forgot about that and then sided with <span class="highlight">China</span> against Japan, a country which takes 27 per cent of Australia’s exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Dawson was prepared originally to visit <span class="highlight">China</span> and try to do something about wheat, but he did not want his visit to be made into a political mission which would tie him to any political agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By his actions, the Leader of the Opposition has clearly indicated that <span class="highlight">China</span> should not buy any more wheat from Australia until Australia has accepted the policies that <span class="highlight">China</span> would want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If anyone has done anything to keep the wheat market in <span class="highlight">China</span> closed to Australia, it is the Leader of the Opposition by his actions and by his suggestions that this is the course that <span class="highlight">China</span> should take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The beneficiaries of this would be Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He falsely praised <span class="highlight">China</span> for having rigidly followed a policy of having no troops in other countries - a plainly false, blind statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that <span class="highlight">China</span> has always kept its word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have indicated and has been mentioned in the debate, the Leader of the Opposition agreed with <span class="highlight">China</span> over Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not on any occasion did he argue with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One, I think, concerns an old school friend, Francis James, who has been imprisoned in <span class="highlight">China</span> for a considerable time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then the best that he could do was to appeal to the Press and say how Francis James had supported Chinese policies and that if the Press could convince the Chinese that Francis James was a friend of <span class="highlight">China</span>, they might let him go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He agreed with <span class="highlight">China</span> on all points that were raised in public so, presumably, he agreed on all points that were raised in private. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all want normal relationships with <span class="highlight">China</span> but we do not want to be in a competition to get to Peking first at the price of friends and interests vital to Australia and other small countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does he not understand that <span class="highlight">China</span> is seeking the elimination of the United States presence and security support for South East and East Asia and the Western Pacific area which means the destruction of ANZUS, the withdrawal of bases in Australia and the withdrawal of forces and troops including the Seventh Fleet and all the rest right down the Western Pacific? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition has ignored <span class="highlight">China</span>’s support for revolutionary warfare; he has ignored <span class="highlight">China</span>’s blatant support and pursuit of nuclear policies; he has ignored the fact that <span class="highlight">China</span> is building strategic military roads in Asia that could be used to invade Thailand through Laos or through Nepal and which could be used for invasions in other areas; he has ignored the basic interests of Korea, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, South East Asian countries and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We find honourable members opposite grudgingly accepting the fact that <span class="highlight">China</span> will be recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I asked him whether the figure I have just quoted or figures similar to those were correct when he used the argument that we were in Vietnam because <span class="highlight">China</span> was involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Statistics lacking include those on refugees and civilian casualties in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, enemy losses, the effects on health of herbicides used in Vietnam, the significant inflationary effect of the war on the United States economy, and the long range costs of Vietnam veterans benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government’s Vietnam policy has been wrong, as has been exposed by the passage of history, so too has been its policy on <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government sees that there are sufficient countries in this world - some of them of such tremendous importance - prepared to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span> that it wishes to find a place in the line to begin diplomatic relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government sees that the number of countries seeking to establish diplomatic relations and willing to support <span class="highlight">China</span>’s entry into the United Nations is such that <span class="highlight">China</span> will be admitted to the United Nations either with our assistance or in spite of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government said Australia could not recognise <span class="highlight">China</span> because of her war-like stance in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>President Nixon has said that we have to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span> for the sake of peace in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the opposite to that statement made by President Nixon is that the American Government has been prepared to court war while continuing to try to isolate <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been prepared to court world war for the sake of maintaining a policy of non-recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span> and for the sake of not creating diplomatic relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was preparing himself to maintain a stance of opposition to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Then  President  Nixon made his announcement that he would seek an opportunity to visit <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When  Mr Anthony  was asked about his opinion of  Mr Whitlam’s  tour of <span class="highlight">China</span> he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wouldn’t criticise  Mr Whitlam’s  visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> on purely political grounds; I think some of his actions there were a little indiscreet, but if it can help in improving relationships with the Western world, then he’s doing a service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The outstanding impression that one has of the visit of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  to <span class="highlight">China</span> and the astonishing verbatim record of his discussions with Chou En-lai on 5th July is that of a pilgrimage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This man sits on when he has just heard, in one unambiguous sentence - and I will not quote it all - the epitome of what Chou, Mao and Lin Piao and other Chinese Communists have been spelling out at length for decades, namely, that they, <span class="highlight">China</span>, not the United States, Japan or anyone else, are going to dominate the East, including Korea, Taiwan, IndoChina, Thailand and the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next country that <span class="highlight">China</span> mentions which is to be liberated from United States aggression after Korea and Japan is Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he recall the way the Taiwan issue came into being: How Britain, Labour Britain, trying desperately to establish normal relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>, opted 21 years ago to support Peking in the matter and how the British Labour Party and its Ministers were insulted and rejected by the Chinese Communists? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States Government will not pursue a course which will lead to involvement in the civil conflict in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Both men expounded the view that they regarded Formosa as an integral part of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the United Sta’.es moved to assert aid to other nonCommunist governments around the perimeter of Asia should they be attacked, and those governments included Formosa and IndoChina. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It led directly to the tragedy of Vietnam and it gave substance to the 2- <span class="highlight">China</span> position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just as there were 2 Koreas, soon there would be 2 Vietnams and 2 Chinas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can it be that the Leader of the Opposition has already ceded Laos to <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to listen to the Leader of the Opposition one would think that <span class="highlight">China</span> had been on a peace crusade for 20 years, and had been unjustly treated by the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He left <span class="highlight">China</span> trumpeting about Chinese honesty and reliability which he declared to be a watchword. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me quote from a voice which the Leader of the Opposition must have forgotten, a man with one of the most distinguished and knowledgeable backgrounds on <span class="highlight">China</span> of the wartime and immediate postwar period, a man who went with  Mr Attlee  as interpreter when the British Labour Party sent a mission to <span class="highlight">China</span> in 1954. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To praise Chinese genocide in Tibet as the elimination of feudalism, to attend peace congresses in <span class="highlight">China</span>, to see wall pictures advocating hate of the outside world, and to come home and hold up <span class="highlight">China</span> as the paragon of peace, as some members of the Party have done, extends this form of blindness a degree further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fortunately less has been heard since <span class="highlight">China</span>’s attack on India . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From all that the Leader did in his visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> and from all that he has said since, the Labor Party frankly still does not attempt to answer that strategy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This debate on foreign policy is not a debate about <span class="highlight">China</span> alone, ft is true that the Chinese exercise at the present time has captured the imagination of people because of the initiative of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is going to be the <span class="highlight">China</span> Premier election, or something of that sort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who cared to consider politics at that time only had to look first at the  Deputy  Prime Minister of this country, the right honourable member for Richmond  (Mr Anthony)  whingeing his way around Europe, trying to knock his way through the doors of the European Common Market and being rejected at every point, and then at the triumphant visit of the Leader of the Opposition to Asia, including not only <span class="highlight">China</span> but Japan and other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia will never look at the <span class="highlight">China</span> issue the same way again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the Minister for the Navy talked about the inconsistencies or the illegalities, or whatever it was, of the position of <span class="highlight">China</span> and Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He remarked about the acceptance by the Leader of the Opposition - not exactly the acceptance - but the acknowledgment of the position taken by <span class="highlight">China</span> that Taiwan was a province of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Chiang Kaishek for years has said, and this Government has accepted it, that <span class="highlight">China</span> apparently and Taiwan are of the one part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Taiwan is a part of <span class="highlight">China</span> - and I do not necessarily accept this view myself; but in the legality of the world this is the way it goes- Chaing Kai-shek has no right to be the government of Taiwan and we have been supporting an illegal government there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We cannot look at <span class="highlight">China</span> that way because no-one else in the world will accept it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At this time Australia is seeking to broaden its relations with the Soviet Union and to normalise its relations wilh the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We recognise that the establishment of full and normal relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> on mutually acceptable terms will bc a difficult and perhaps protracted exercise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>, if not yet a world power, is clearly concerned that her presence should be felt throughout the world as a power of consequence, as a revolutionary leader, and as a potential trading partner, and in the exercise of her diplomacy against Russia strategically, against Taiwan in undercutting its voting strength in the United Nations and against India, its Asian neighbour, with which it has its longest boundary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>’s landward links with West Asia and East Europe would cross Russian territory and therefore create dependence on Russian terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The scare diplomacy of <span class="highlight">China</span> in the 1960s was expressed by Premier Chou En-lai in 1961 when he said that Africa was ripe for revolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This concern is now being replaced by the long term diplomacy of a more settled <span class="highlight">China</span>; of cooperation with friendly governments, irrespective of ideology, lt is apparent therefore that this scare diplomacy which emanated from <span class="highlight">China</span> during the middle 1960s and in particular at the time of the cultural revolution is changing, which is not surprising because the cultural revolution was the greatest disaster <span class="highlight">China</span> has faced, lt is my contention that <span class="highlight">China</span> has a vital interest in ensuring that the Russians do not gain a dominant presence in the Indian Ocean and this is primarily the motivating factor in her relationships and the seeking of a detente as it would be with the Western world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have heard Government supporters say that they would not sell any wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>; that they would sooner let the people of <span class="highlight">China</span> starve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is a ridiculous statement to make when one looks at our wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would put more faith in the writings crf that outstanding Australian diplomat, Gregory Clark, in his book ‘In Fear of <span class="highlight">China</span>’, which is here for any honourable member to look at, than I would in what honourable members opposite say about <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> has been criticised by members of the Government for its so-called aggressive attitude towards India. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is any amount of evidence available in the Parliamentary Library to show that <span class="highlight">China</span> was correct in defining her borders with India. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen copies of the letters that the Chinese Government wrote to the governments of those countries, asking for a round table conference to define their borders because <span class="highlight">China</span> bad no defined borders with them after the Communist Government took over the country from the old corrupt, crooked Chiang Kai-shek regime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The governments of Burma, Nepal and Pakistan conferred round the conference table, and the border disputes between those countries and <span class="highlight">China</span> were cleaned up in a proper, peaceful manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I made some study of the conflict between India and <span class="highlight">China</span> over the McMahon line and I believe, as many important world figures who have made greater studies than I have - British people - that <span class="highlight">China</span> was correct over the border dispute with India and the McMahon line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that the Government is changing face and is going to vote for <span class="highlight">China</span>’s admission to the United Nations, but I think it has left its run too late, because the Chinese realise, and they state, that we have been the puppets of the United States for too long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present facts of the administration of Tibet are that Tibet is an autonomous region within the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and is administered by a revolutionary committee responsible to the government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-37-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>– The allegation by the Minister for Trade and Industry  (Mr Anthony)  and the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  that the Australian Labor Party delegation to <span class="highlight">China</span>, and I in particular, are responsible for the loss of the <span class="highlight">China</span> wheat market is indicative of the miserable measures which Ministers of this Government will adopt in order to keep themselves in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I had 3 objectives in going to <span class="highlight">China</span>: Firstly, to find out the facts on why <span class="highlight">China</span> had stopped wheat purchases from Australia; secondly, to see whether it was possible to get <span class="highlight">China</span> to resume wheat purchases from Australia; and, thirdly, to examine the possibilities of expanded trade from Australia, particularly in primary products and basic raw materials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To put the matter more bluntly, the assertion of the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon),  the  Deputy  Prime Minister and the Minister for Primary Industry that Australia’s foreign policy or ministerial criticism of <span class="highlight">China</span> has had nothing to do with the loss of the huge Chinese wheat market is false. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the last 10 years <span class="highlight">China</span> has purchased 22 million tons of wheat from Australia at a cost of $US1,20Om. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The large wheat purchases from Canada and Australia have been due to a food shortage in <span class="highlight">China</span> in earlier years and they also enabled <span class="highlight">China</span> to export higher value food products like rice which earned a net gain of foreign exchange. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During this period of wheat purchases from Australia neither Canada nor Australia was given any particular priority for <span class="highlight">China</span>’s wheat because neither of those 2 countries recognised <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When discussing the policies of the Australian Government as they affect <span class="highlight">China</span>’s trade decisions, both the Foreign Minister and the Minister for Foreign Trade referred to the hostile political policies of the Australian Government against <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as <span class="highlight">China</span> is concerned, trade, economics and politics are inseparable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of Australia’s hostility to <span class="highlight">China</span> it follows that such an attitude cannot but affect our trade policy with the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In expanding on <span class="highlight">China</span>’s policies on the wheat trade  Mr Pai  said that because of the Australian Government’s open and continuing hostility to <span class="highlight">China</span> certain obstacles to a continuation of Australia’s wheat trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Firstly, Australia is supporting Chiang Kai-shek and has established diplomatic relations with Taiwan; secondly, Australia has continuously opposed the restoration of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s legitimate seat in the United Nations; thirdly, Australia supports and follows United States aggression in South East Asia; fourthly, Australia refuses to recognise the Government of the People’s Republic pf <span class="highlight">China</span> as the sole legal government representing all the Chinese people, including the people of the Province of Taiwan; and lastly, Australia is collaborating with the USA to create 2 Chinas, or one <span class="highlight">China</span> and one Taiwan and is, therefore, interfering in the internal affairs of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In explaining <span class="highlight">China</span>’s relationships with Canada the Minister for Foreign Trade said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> used to buy more wheat from Australia than from Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the Minister for Foreign Trade - informed Monsieur Pepin that if <span class="highlight">China</span> continued to buy wheat then Canada would get first priority to supply th:it wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are the words of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s Minister for Foreign Trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Foreign Trade said: ‘ … if <span class="highlight">China</span> continued to buy wheat then Canada would get first priority to supply that wheat.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As regards the possibilities of future trade, the Chinese Minister for Foreign Trade informed the delegation that if the Australian Government changed its present policies of hostility towards <span class="highlight">China</span> then Australia would receive the same consideration and priority as Canada, but until this happens Canada has first priority to supply the wheat required by <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As regards the restoration of the wheat trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>, the facts are that while in <span class="highlight">China</span> I did everything possible to persuade Chinese authorities to alter their wheat policy as it presently discriminates against the Australian wheat grower and to resume wheat purchases from the Australian Wheat Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I argued that if <span class="highlight">China</span> were prepared to trade with Australian private companies like Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd which comprised people or shareholders, <span class="highlight">China</span> should be prepared to trade also with Australian wheat farmers who are really shareholders of the Australian Wheat Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the day I left Peking J was informed that consideration would be given to my request to resume the wheat trade with Australia on the grounds that Australian wheat farmers, like the shareholders of an Australian private company, were not responsible for the Australian Government’s foreign policies and hostility to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contrary to the Deputy Prime Minister’s crude attempt to blame me personally for the loss of last month’s wheat sale, if the Chinese Government does decide to resume wheat purchases from Australia in the near future it will do so because of the explanations and pleas which we made to <span class="highlight">China</span>’s trade policy makers on behalf of the Australian wheat farmers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The danger now is that, because of this deceit in attempting to blame the Labor Party delegation to <span class="highlight">China</span> and myself in particular as well as refusing to accept the real reasons why <span class="highlight">China</span> has suspended wheat purchases, Chinese Ministers who are contemptuous of Australian Government foreign policy may now completely dismiss the extra considerations they were prepared to give to the case that Australian wheat farmers, via the Wheat Board, are distinct from the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As <span class="highlight">China</span>’s highest policy makers are now fully informed of the role of the Australian Wheat Board and its relationship to the Australian Government and wheat farmers, it is my hope that <span class="highlight">China</span> will once again renew wheat purchases from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The facts are that Australia was incredibly lucky not to lose its wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> in 1967 when the Wheat Board introduced politics into its negotiations by handing the Chinese buying agents a threatening political note. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Country Party members interjected and maintained in the Parliament on Thursday that the  Chairman  of the Australian Wheat Board had indicated that the loss of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s wheat market had nothing whatsoever to do with Australia’s foreign policy or political attitudes to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both the  Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry and the Minister for Primary Industry have publicly accused me of losing wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> which were to be negotiated last month by the Australian Wheat Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr A.  C. Everett, a member of the Australian Wheat Board, stated in the ‘Mail Times’ of Horsham on 28th July that the Australian Wheat Board at no stage this year had prospects of selling wheat to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Everett  said that the Minister told the meeting that the Australian Wheat Board was on the point of making a good sale to <span class="highlight">China</span> but the Australian Labor Party went over there and ruined it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that never at any time was there a prospect of an Australian wheat sale to <span class="highlight">China</span> this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This whole matter of losing wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> is serious in view of the grave allegation made against me by the Minister for Trade and Industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I deeply resent the accusation that I am responsible for losing last month a wheat sale to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me,  Mr Deputy Speaker  that if this sort of allegation is not cleaned up, the only course to follow will be to get the  Chairman  of the Wheat Board to appear at the Bar of this House or the Bar of the Senate to inform us of the whole truth of the loss last month of a wheat sale to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His colleague the Minister for Primary Industry has been publicly rebuked by a member of the Australian Wheat Board who stated categorically that never at any time was there a prospect of an Australian wheat sale to <span class="highlight">China</span> this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have listened to the honourable member for Dawson  (Dr Patterson)  with a great deal of interest, but also with a degree of sadness because he persisted in trying to make a political issue of wheat sales to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that every responsible member of the Australian Wheat Board and members of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation, and informed people in the Australian wheat industry must listen in fear when they hear the Australian Labor Party continue its policy of trying to make it politically impossible for Australia to make a wheat sale to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a rather extraordinary exercise because at that time honourable members opposite said that I was to blame for the loss of a sale to <span class="highlight">China</span> because of statements I had made on a television programme in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They said that wheat sales were lost to <span class="highlight">China</span> because T made on that programme statements that were offensive to the Chinese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Dawson had the audacity to put before this House that that was the reason for the loss of sales to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, today he apparently is concerned that his actions might have been the cause of the loss of sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> and he is trying to square off with Australian wheat growers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that Peking through the British in mid March complained of foolish statements on <span class="highlight">China</span> by Australian Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts of the matter are that last year Canada made its normal sale to <span class="highlight">China</span> in October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Traditionally, over the 9 years we have been selling to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> we have entered the field a month, 6 weeks or 2 months later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other reason was that <span class="highlight">China</span> had a very good wheat harvest last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This fact has emerged in conversations with  Mr Pai,  a  Deputy  Prime Minister of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even reports of his conversation with the Labor Party delegation show that <span class="highlight">China</span> had a very good wheat harvest last year and did not need to buy as much wheat as usual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That could have been the other reason, but unfortunately the Labor Party was not prepared to accept the 2 sound reasons I have given for the lack of wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Labor Party had to jump on the bandwagon and start making political issue of it by bringing in the question of Taiwan, opposition to the entry of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> into the United Nations and diplomatic recognition of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether we recognise <span class="highlight">China</span> or whether or not it is a member of the United Nations, the facts are that Australia until March 1971 had sold more wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> than had Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts also are that whilst there is great difficulty in selling wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> at the moment, other trade is going along normally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not been backward in expressing my desire for normalised relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would like to see <span class="highlight">China</span> seated in the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we do not want to see <span class="highlight">China</span> seated there at the expense of Taiwan, which is another republic of some standing and which is also a considerable buyer of wheat and other products from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wheat Board to go to <span class="highlight">China</span> and sit down with the Chinese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On every world market, with the exception of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, it can be seen that wheat sales have risen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a pity that we did not get another sale to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> so that we could have cleared up any surplus that we might have had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> is a great market for wheat but I think it is wrong for people to get carried away with the idea that the potential market opportunities are as great as the Labor Party would lead us to think. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> has its difficulties in earning foreign exchange. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, <span class="highlight">China</span>’s imports are 40 per cent less than Australia’s imports and its exports are about 40 per cent less than Australia’s exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are the dimensions of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its biggest trading customer is Japan which does not have any form of recognition with <span class="highlight">China</span> but still does very attractive trade with that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until the Labor Party involved politics in the issue this year, we were <span class="highlight">China</span>’s fourth biggest trading customer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the Minister who, just a short time after being sworn in as Minister for Trade and Industry, rose to his feet in front of a television audience and said with respect to politics in trade and wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span>: ‘1 will not barter my soul for wheat’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only was he telling the Chinese that they were unfit to be dealt with because of the peril to his soul but also a former Foreign Minister,  Sir Gordon  Freeth, spoke of ‘serious questionings of conscience in Australia about how far we are justified in trading with <span class="highlight">China</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘We should not involve ourselves in trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>’, says he. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said this because we were actually selling wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Minister for Trade and Industry says: ‘We must not deal with politics in trade’, but the Government has been dealing with politics in trade in relation to <span class="highlight">China</span> for a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are 10 years behind Japan in trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>, 3 years behind Canada, 2 years behind Italy and I year behind the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Minister for Trade and Industry is in this House abusing the Opposition and trying to cover up for his errors President Nixon is going to <span class="highlight">China</span>, not out of sweetness, love and charity but because the United States corporations have prospects of Si, 000m worth of sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> and they need the sales and want the trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is 1 year behind the United Slates of America in trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister tried carefully to give the impression that there were no links whatever between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1968 there has been a Japan-<span class="highlight">China</span> memorandum trade agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Japanese have been doing extraordinarily good trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> amounting to S800m a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have given examples and instances which have led <span class="highlight">China</span> to say: These people are insulting us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Few of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s trade agreements seem to be so open ended and timewise as this one on wheat purchases from Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia should have a trade office in <span class="highlight">China</span> now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A trade office should have been established in <span class="highlight">China</span> years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The makeup of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s foreign trade, particularly its imports, has changed substantially over the last 15 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>’s major goods are being imported from the United Kingdom, France, West Germany and Italy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of these countries are ahead of us in their trade links with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, as a result of the lack of initiative by this Government we have missed, for the moment at any rate, the boat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first point in this discussion on which I must join issue is the suggestion that the Australian government’s foreign policy is one - I quote from the wording of this matter of public importance - ‘of continued hostility to <span class="highlight">China</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s policy on <span class="highlight">China</span> has been stated clearly on a number of occasions in recent times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 11th May the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  announced that the Government had as its long term objective the normalising of our bilateral relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, to which end it had been decided to explore the possibility of establishing a dialogue with that Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 13th May the Prime Minister again emphasised Australia’s desire to have normal bilateral relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, that there is no restriction whatsoever on the movement of Australian people to <span class="highlight">China</span>; provided only that they can get a visa from the Chinese and provided that security considerations are not involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, apart from special restrictive lists - this refers to goods of strategic importance - we permit trade with mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, for the year ended 30th June 1970 our exports were SI 25.8m, mainly but not wholly wheat, and our imports from <span class="highlight">China</span> were $32m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said further that in the meantime we want to keep moving towards normal relations with mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> without waiting for the completion of formalities for full diplomatic recognition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has called attention to the fact that as far as trade between Australian and <span class="highlight">China</span> is concerned we are dealing with different political systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Prime Minister has said, we have to look much further and ask ourselves when we are engaging in dealings with <span class="highlight">China</span>: What are we likely to gain as far as the interests of Australia are concerned in the long term, in the medium term and in the short term? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, a major criticism of the excursion of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  to <span class="highlight">China</span> lies in the way in which he conceded in advance everything to the Chinese, leaving his country with no negotiating elements at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to the Australian Government both inevitable and desirable that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> should be represented in the United Nations and should hold the <span class="highlight">China</span> seat in the Security Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, we consider that the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> should remain a member of the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On the contrary, by indicating that we think it desirable that the People’s Republic should hold the <span class="highlight">China</span> seat in the Security Council we have gone beyond what many countries have so far been prepared to concede. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been pointed out, <span class="highlight">China</span> buys more from Japan and West Germany, which do not recognise it nor have diplomatic relations with it, than from any other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once <span class="highlight">China</span> saw that the Australian Labor Party was making a political issue of wheat sales naturally it took advantage of the situation to twist our tail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have compounded this by going to <span class="highlight">China</span> and making this an international public political exercise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course <span class="highlight">China</span> will make it a political exercise; the Opposition has handed it to <span class="highlight">China</span> on a plate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But <span class="highlight">China</span> is not doing it in any other area except the area the Opposition has nominated, that, is wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> is not making it a political exercise in respect of metals or any other trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, at the Canton trade fair we got SI 5m worth of trade contracts with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the one item that the members of the Opposition pick on to make a political exercise - wheat - <span class="highlight">China</span> sees its opportunity and of course takes the opportunity the Australian Labor Party has offered it and puts the political screws on in that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe <span class="highlight">China</span> has done so and may continue to do so so long as the honourable member for Dawson  (Dr Patterson)  persists in raising in the House matters which may compound this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was about the time of the Senate elections last year that the Canadian Government finalised its arrangements for the recognition of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> anr) 2 weeks after that was announced to the world the Chinese announced that the Canadians had won a bumper contract, one of the best that the Canadian Government had ever pulled off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do not start talking about what has happened over the last few weeks with  Mr Whitlam’s  going to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the entry of the Labor Party has only been part of the political tempo heating up over <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Anthony  says that what the Labor Party has been doing is to make it politically impossible for the Wheat Board to sell wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The political impossibility in the sale of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> lies with the Government’s own policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All honourable members on the other side of the chamber on the Country Party benches and on the Liberal Party benches know that, contrary to their claim that trade and politics in <span class="highlight">China</span> do not mix - a little in the same way as sport and politics do not mix in South Africa - the reality is that the Chinese Government has announced that they do mix. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr N.  H. Bowen, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has made the statement that the Australian Government does not have a policy of hostility towards <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just ask  Mr N.  H. Bowen, the very knowledgeable Minister for Foreign Affairs, backed up by an entire department of experts: Does Australia pursue a policy of 2 Chinas or not? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the Government is pursuing a policy of 2 Chinas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What  Mr N.  H. Bowen,  Mr McMahon  and  Mr Anthony  are really trying to tell the Australian people is that it is not reasonable for the Chinese to refuse to go into the United Nations as one <span class="highlight">China</span> with some rival claimant to the same power sitting opposite them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Government is trying to say, in fact, is that there are 2 Chinas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is only 1 <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whether it is Chiang Kaishek or Mao tse-tung speaking, each claims that there is only one <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Foreign Minister, who is very learned and very knowledgeable, is now telling us that there are 2 Chinas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is Chiang Kai-shek the sole and legal governor of the whole of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The majority of the people want <span class="highlight">China</span> admitted to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The majority of the American people want <span class="highlight">China</span> recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has placed itself in a dismal situation in which it has lost $100m a year - a total of $904m since 1969, and a total of 743 million bushels of lost wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr A.  C. Everett has said that the Australian Wheat Board had lost its sales of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> for one simple reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of this, we have lost $100m a year in wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he had, he would not have talked his way to <span class="highlight">China</span>, talked his way down the steps of the aircraft, talked his way around <span class="highlight">China</span> and talked his way home again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, he would not have come into this House today and talked at all about the problems of selling wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> because the honourable member, and he above all, has made it more difficult to sell wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I beg of him, with all respect and friendship, to remember that just talking is not the way in which to go around selling our products, particularly in <span class="highlight">China</span> of all places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Dawson recently talked his way to <span class="highlight">China</span>, talked his way down the steps of the aircraft and then threw his cards face up on the table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me quote from a letter written by Professor Arndt to the Canberra Times’ on the visit of the Australian Labor Party delegation to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was talking about the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  - he gave away in advance every bargaining counter that Australia has in future negotiations with <span class="highlight">China</span> and in the process gratuitously insulted not only the United States, Japan, Thailand, the Philippines and Cambodia but even the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He continued:  1  have for 20 years advocated diplomatic recog nition of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> and its admission to the United Nations - but not at any price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is nonsense for him to come into this chamber and talk about selling wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> when he knows that the policy of the Australian Council of Trade Unions - indeed, the Australian Labor Party - deliberately to prevent the export of rams from Australia has resulted in Australia having to rat on its international obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a tremendous imbalance of trade between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are importing from <span class="highlight">China</span> a third of the value of commodities the Chinese buy from us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real crunch will come when we say that we are going to trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no good just coming into this House and sounding off eloquently when it is known that the fundamental problem facing us all is how to have a freer flow of trade between Australia and not only <span class="highlight">China</span> but also other parts of Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 beg of the honourable member for Dawson to remember that he has an additional responsibility from where he sits on the front bench to try to influence the policies of the shadow Minister for Trade and Industry and his other colleagues on this matter so that we can have a more effective trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not deny that we have problems, but it is an Australian problem and not a party political problem to have an effective trade relationship with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  deplore  the recent antics of the Leader of the Opposition when he led a delegation to some of the countries of Asia, notably to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable gentlemen that the Leader of the Opposition went to <span class="highlight">China</span> to play politics with wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did, of course, come out of <span class="highlight">China</span> saying that the Chinese Government was quite willing to particpate in a renewed Geneva Conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker,  we are seeking as a Government to establish better relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the House again that there is no sudden short cut to normal relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>, as history so clearly shows, particularly Soviet and Chinese history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s policy on representation in the United Nations of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and of Taiwan has already been stated in this House during the course of this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said it was inevitable and right that <span class="highlight">China</span> should should hold the permanent seat in the Security Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have also said that we believed the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>- Taiwan - should be given the chance of maintaining its membership if so desired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a lot of talk about there being only one <span class="highlight">China</span> and that Taiwan is a province of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when the Leader of the Opposition states this proposition he evades the fact that there are two governments each controlling a certain area with a certain population and each claiming to be the legitimate Government of the whole of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He obviously does not understand that acceptance of the idea that Taiwan is a province of <span class="highlight">China</span> implies that force can be used to restore control by <span class="highlight">China</span> without invoking United Nations assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has for many years recognised the Taiwan Government - the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> - and in 1966 completed the formalities by establishing an embassy there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> and the status of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> - of Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition has said the Canadian formula is the one his Party would adopt for immediate recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Canadian formula notes <span class="highlight">China</span>’s claim to Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But  Mr Whitlam,  while adopting the Canadian formula as his own, also concedes Taiwan to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They, the United States, like us, have declared their attitude on <span class="highlight">China</span>’s admission to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we should say to her that she is now entitled to pursue her own interests which require a restoration of relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This kind of advice disregards Australia’s interest by assuming at once that it is to our advantage for <span class="highlight">China</span> and Japan to move into a close relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact it looks precisely the kind of negotiating position <span class="highlight">China</span> herself could take up towards Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, the Leader of the Opposition urges Japan to tear up her treaty with Taiwan and do business with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because America is a super-power and <span class="highlight">China</span> a great power I think it may be inevitable that they will treat on a bilateral basis on the big issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He accuses the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  of playing politics in <span class="highlight">China</span> with wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition said when he was in <span class="highlight">China</span> that if the Australian Government established diplomatic and normal relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> he felt Australia would receive a fair share of the <span class="highlight">China</span> wheat market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the following words be added to the motion: but this House deplores the conduct of the Prime Minister in attempting to narrow debate on the question of Australia’s future diplomatic and trade relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to a personal and partisan level and for basing his approach on incorrect information’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for the meeting itself - and I ask honourable members to give some attention to this and to give consideration to what was said by the Australian pressmen who attended in <span class="highlight">China</span> with the Australian Labor Party delegation - let me read some of the comments by the people who were there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He spoke of the differences between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union over their border dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs are 2 people in the Parliament, apart from the Leader of the Opposition, who know best the tremendously cordial reception the Leader of the Opposition received in Japan and the Philippines after his visit to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition has done what the Australian Government should have done - trying to build a bridge with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is time that honourable members in this Parliament look at the question of the recognition of .the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to bring it into its rightful place in the United Nations - to bring it into the Security Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over 60 countries have already recognised <span class="highlight">China</span> and have diplomatic relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia should establish diplomatic relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely the rational attitude of the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party delegation to <span class="highlight">China</span> was a bridge of friendship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one examines the McMahon line on the IndiaChina border dispute of 1962, one notes there is no difference between the policies of Nationalist <span class="highlight">China</span> and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the event of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> being admitted to the UN, I take it that the Nationalist Chinese Government on Taiwan will be expelled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But does the Minister for Foreign Affairs deny that at the Cairo Conference of 1943 men of the callibre of Churchill, Roosevelt and Chiang Kai-shek agreed that Taiwan was a province of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why is it that after 22 years of negative thought they now determine that there are 2 Chinas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They know, in fact, that the People’s Republic will be recognised as the rightful Government of <span class="highlight">China</span> and will take its place in the Security Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They know, as Lord Trevelyan said, that their system, the new 2-<span class="highlight">China</span> policy, would have to get a two-third majority vote in order to be accepted, and that this is an impossibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was in <span class="highlight">China</span> in 1960. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I was in <span class="highlight">China</span> hysteria was building up about the taking of their territory, Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am aware that there had been over 100 meetings between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the United States in Warsaw.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no doubt that a fear of the United States is worrying <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, <span class="highlight">China</span> does not have troops right on the border of the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I shall deal first with the visit of the Australian Labor Party delegation to Peking and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion there is nothing wrong with anyone going - as a delegation or separately - to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition went there to try to embarrass the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  and the Government on the matter of recognising the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the scrubbing off of Taiwan, and the shadow Minister for Primary Industry, the honourable member for Dawson  (Dr Patterson)  went there to embarrass Government supporters in wheat seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from agreeing that Taiwan and its population of 14-odd million people live in just another Chinese province, the man aspiring to be Prime Minister of Australia gave away in advance during the great kowtow every bargaining counter that Australia would have had in future negotiations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both of these Australian Labor Party men smugly proclaimed that, because of the Government’s <span class="highlight">China</span> policy, $10On worth of wheat has not been sold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No less irresponsible than his entirely unnecessary servility to  Mr Chou  was his use of the occasion not to try and improve relations between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Australian Government- any Australian Government, now or in the future - but to limit any improvement to relations between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 11th May the Prime Minister announced that the Government had as its long term objective the normalisation of our bilateral relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, to explore the possibility of establishing a dialogue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Japan is becoming an economic and industrial super power; Britain is turning towards the European Economic Community rather than a long way east of the Suez Canal; Russian influence and interest are on the increase; while <span class="highlight">China</span> - the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> - has adopted a far less inward looking stance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would not criticise  Mr  Whillam’s  visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> on purely political grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Leader of the Country Party and Deputy Prime Minister is big enough to concede that 2 days later, when I gave my National Press Club talk in Canberra, I removed any suggestion that there was any indiscretion on my part during the 4 weeks in which I visited <span class="highlight">China</span>, Japan and the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, he says that Premier Chou En-lai has repudiated my comments on my conversation with him about the Geneva Conference being revived and <span class="highlight">China</span>’s attendance at any such revived conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our opening an Embassy in Taiwan in 1966 to the so-called Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, after resisting pressures to do so for 16 years, an off-the-cuff decision made, without consulting the Department of External Affairs or, apparently, iiic Minister for External Affairs, by the Prime Minister of the day, himself an amiable man whom no one could dislike but who knew almost nothing about foreign affairs, was as foolish as it was naive.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there was anything to my disadvantage there the Prime Minister would have spotted it, but I can show these records to any person in this House and they bear out how cordially I was received in Japan and how eagerly my assessment of <span class="highlight">China</span> and her attitude towards her neighbours, including Japan, was sought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It believes that a ‘gradual solution’ will be possible when the Taiwanese have been able to get rid of Chiang and Taiwan reverts to the sort of society to which Peking could safely grant a semblance of independence as an ‘autonomous’ province of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This apparently was a briefer form of what he said last Tuesday afternoon - ‘some cocktail gossip with a foreign representative in <span class="highlight">China</span>*. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We attended no cocktail parties in <span class="highlight">China</span> at all, but I notice that in the ‘Bulletin’ of 7th August there is this phrase: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He is the foremost French and, I believe, European diplomatic expert on <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what happened was this: It had appeared in the newspapers before we came back, not from us or from any of the Australian journalists accompanying us from this country when Monsieur Manac’h had in fact visited Premier Chou En-lai in aid of the Australian Labor Party delegation’s visit to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we had representatives in Peking we would know what was going on in all the states of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> and we could pool this information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years Australia has sponsored in the United Nations a resolution that any resolution on <span class="highlight">China</span> had to be carried by a two-thirds majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is still a state of war between Japan and the whole of the mainland of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one accepts the view that the treaty which Japan made under American pressure with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek early in 1952  -  more than 2 years after he had taken refuge in Taiwan from the mainland - is not a legal treaty then technically there is still a state of war between Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> was not represented because those who were represented could not agree on which was the Government of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the end of the Korean War when armistice came about; still more when the armistice came about at Geneva in 1954 through the whole of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>; there was the opportunity to make proper national relations, diplomatic relations, between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the other countries in the Pacific region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have done no less than I should in trying to take some initiative in <span class="highlight">China</span> and 1 do not believe that our fellow citizens and those who succeed us and our neighbours will respect us or tolerate us if we pass up another opportunity, if we take a purely partisan attitude on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitudes that the Prime Minister has expressed outside the House, that <span class="highlight">China</span> has served the Liberal Party well in the past and no doubt it will in the future, is I believe a great miscalculation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 feel that this great catastrophe should have been raised as a matter of public importance as I believe it is a far more urgent subject than a dialogue with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Earlier tonight we heard the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  make a rather vicious attack on the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  following his visit to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  has left Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> after a 13-day visit which has made him the best-informed Australian on <span class="highlight">China</span>, its leaders and their policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At a time when our traditional and even historical alliances are, to say the least, less effective than in the past, I think we should for a few minutes study some international occurrences other than those involved in the complex question of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure he would agree that never was there so much drama, never such an intense atmosphere, as existed for a couple of weeks prior to a vote being taken on whether Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> should be admitted to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 20th November 1970 the United Nations General Assembly voted for the twentieth consecutive year, excepting 1964, on the admission of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The draft resolution urges the Assembly to restore to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> all its rights and to recognise the representatives of its Government as the only law ful representatives of <span class="highlight">China</span> at the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The General Assembly in 1961 decided that any proposal to change the representation of <span class="highlight">China</span> was to be classified as an important question and as such would require a two-thirds majority before any decision on the subject be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year when the honourable member for Bonython and I were at the United Nations the vote on the proposal for the admission of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> was 51 in favour, 49 against and 25 abstentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The moral of the story is in the whittling away of the numbers of those countries who had decided to oppose irrevocably the admission of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One rather felt that this would flow over into 1971 and that many of those who had abstained in 1970 no doubt would be faced with this proposition: Should they vote for the admittance of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> to the exclusion of Taiwan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I should like to deal now with the <span class="highlight">China</span> question in the United Nations and the possibilities of what may happen this year in the General Assembly which will commence on 20th September. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The forthcoming debate in the next General Assembly session on the question of the seating of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in the United Nations promises to be one of the most complex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The prospect for <span class="highlight">China</span>’s admission are the best so far but the outcome is by no means a foregone conclusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the subjects of discussion will be <span class="highlight">China</span>’s admission to the Security <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Council because one must keep in mind that if Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> does take a prominent seat in the Security Council, perhaps to the temporary exclusion of Taiwan, forever and a day <span class="highlight">China</span> could veto the readmittance of Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On one issue <span class="highlight">China</span> has ample support and that is that it should be admitted to the General Assembly, but the main obstacle at present is the seating of Taiwan and the further issue of which country shall sit in the Security Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has recently been a big swing in favour of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> but there is still strong support for maintaining Taiwan’s seat in the General Assembly, although it does seem certain that, if Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> gets into the United Nations, it will be awarded a seat in the Security Council also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the substantial shift in the position of the United States and other countries, including Australia, Peking still resolutely insists that it alone should have the seat and that Taiwan, which it considers a province of <span class="highlight">China</span>, should be expelled from the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a considerable amount of talk in the United States and in Australia about finding a compromise solution which will enable both the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Taiwan Government to be members of the General Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the basic difficulty is that both of these governments claim to be the government of <span class="highlight">China</span> and are accordingly constituted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> it seems very unlikely that the Government would be prepared to accept the terms of a resolution which also provided for the seating of the Government of Nationalist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As things stand, both Peking and Taipei claim to be the government of <span class="highlight">China</span> and it is very difficult to see how both would be accepted as members of the United Nations on their own terms or how they themselves could accept this arrangement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, the position is that, although <span class="highlight">China</span>’s chances of getting into the United Nations are better than ever this year, whether it actually becomes a member or accepts membership depends essentially upon what sort of compromise formula can be worked out in the course of the Assembly debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall conclude on this point: It was rather remarkable at the United Nations that those who were to the forefront, supporting the entry of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, were considered to be among those who were the most vitriolic and who had completely ignored the appeal that had been made by U Thant and the  President  of the General Assembly that the 25th Anniversary meeting was to be a General Assembly of peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was utterly ignored by countries such as Albania and others who with vitriolic outbursts and with complete disregard for anyone’s sense of loyalties or traditional loyalties claimed that Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> should be admitted to the United Nations and that Taipei should be thrown on the scrap heap. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard a lot about <span class="highlight">China</span> in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard a lot about the Australian Government’s about-face on <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, the only reason why people of such intellectual incapacity bellieve that the Chinese will come down for the next election is this: They look at a map hanging on a wall and, because <span class="highlight">China</span> is above Australia on that map, they think that the Chinese must come down to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to point out something which has not been mentioned in this debate but which indicates clearly the basis of the Australian Government’s sudden interest in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On Mtn May the Prime Minister announced that the Government had as its long term objective to normalise om’ bilateral relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous, speaker slipped back a couple of years when he referred to it as Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is not any mention in the statement and to my knowledge no mention has been made in the House, that at the SEATO Council meeting in London  Mr Rogers,  the United States Secretary of State, indicated that the United States wanted to encourage a growing role by <span class="highlight">China</span> in Asia which was constructive rather than destructive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>’s struggle to nationhood was bedevilled by aggression, including a lot of Japanese aggression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greatest hope for a lasting accommodation between the conflicting interests so manifest in the South East Asian and East Asian area may lie along the path of endeavouring to convince the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> that Japan has no territorial designs on Chinese territory and that neither the United States of America nor Japan wishes Japan to move into a vacuum left by an American withdrawal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have on our hands a great problem in seeking to establish normal relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this connection, I do not see why the move towards normalisation, to use a horrible in-word, of our relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> should be accompanied - as some members of the Labor Party seem to want - by a move to exclude discourse with South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor do I see any evidence that he has made some secret pact with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr N. H. Bowen)  dealt in detail with <span class="highlight">China</span>, Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, Japan, the South Pacific, Pakistan and India. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has accused the Australian Labor Party of playing politics with wheat and on the subject of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the most vital question of an international nature that is at present of concern to us is the question of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For myself, I reject the concept of suppression, whether it be practised in the United States of America, South Africa, <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Soviet Union oi any other place in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do not believe that flexibility requires of us that we should boot the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in the stomach and unreservedly embrace the Government of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, as the Leader of the Opposition and those who sit behind him advocate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problems of <span class="highlight">China</span> have implications far greater than a comparison of 14 million people with 800 million people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>President  Nixon, as history now records, announced on 16th July his intention to visit mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The true and stark fact is that mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> has now shown a tangible interest in becoming involved in world affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>’s intervention in the Korean campaign, her massive contribution to the unrest still existing in South East Asia and the road she is building in Laos in the direction of Thailand are all factors which give the thinking person reason to be wary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Asia consists of more than just mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Never have I seen him so sensitive to criticism as on the question of his visit to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it was announced that he would leave for <span class="highlight">China</span>, I wrote him a long letter which was sent by registered post. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said: If you finally get on your slow boat to <span class="highlight">China</span>, on your trip of dreams, please,  Mr Whitlam,  raise with the Premier or the  President  of that great nation which you embrace the question of its involvement in Vietnam and its actions which have prolonged the unrest and unease in South East Asia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the carefully documented reports of the conversations that he had, all one finds is reference to his inability to control chopsticks capably but no reference whatsoever to the question of Vietnam and <span class="highlight">China</span>’s role in that region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He sets himself against the United States and constantly holds out a branch of friendship to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the following words be added to the motion: but this house deplores the conduct of the Prime Minister in attempting to narrow debate on the question of Australia’s future diplomatic and trade relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to a personal and partisan level and for basing his approach on incorrect information’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I want to remind the House that the 5 subjects of the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr N. H. Bowen)  were <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, Japan, the South Pacific and Pakistan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall have time, of course, to mention only a few of these subjects, but firstly let me turn to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  entered this debate tonight to make, as I have said, a narrow, partisan and personal attack on the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  under this heading of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they can stimulate fear in the Australian people on the subject of <span class="highlight">China</span>, in addition to the fear of the unions and the fear of demonstrations supporting the United Nations resolutions against South African sporting tours of our country, this will support their narrow, partisan cause whatever harm it is doing to our nation at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He and the ALP team he led to <span class="highlight">China</span> have done a splendid job for our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let me come back to <span class="highlight">China</span>, indeed to the question of our attitude towards all totalitarian regimes behind the Iron and Bamboo Curtains. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exchanges with these countries can do nothing but good and it is in this context that we want to see the visit of the Leader of the Opposition and his team to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In talking about a 2-<span class="highlight">China</span> policy let me make it quite clear that in my personal view if this were a perfect world it would be more satisfactory if Taiwan could be recognised as a second <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I point out that it is because of the policies of this present Liberal-Country Party Government, believing that there has only been one <span class="highlight">China</span> and supporting only one <span class="highlight">China</span> in the United Nations for the last 22 years, that we have been left in this most difficult position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who knows - they may vote overwhelmingly to join the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and save us the difficult choice which we are left with in deciding whether to continue with the policy that this Government has perpetrated to date, that there is only one <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the only way we can bring the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, into the family of nations is to recognise only the government of that country - and this is not to say that we are going to recognise any forceful takeover of Taiwan - then we must make this difficult choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, for 22 years it has recognised one <span class="highlight">China</span> and that is the <span class="highlight">China</span> which exists on the island of Taiwan at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How different the Communism of <span class="highlight">China</span> could be from the Communism of Vietnam if Ho Chi Minn’s successors take over in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must take trips to <span class="highlight">China</span> - and T include the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  in this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a good thing for the Leader of the Opposition to go to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Leader of the Opposition took a trip to <span class="highlight">China</span>, and good luck to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What a pity to see the Leader of the Opposition go to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, there to produce a policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have, all of us, been involved in fictions over <span class="highlight">China</span> and in fictions over Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is to say, the fact that the people of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> recognise Taiwan as a province of <span class="highlight">China</span> and that the Taiwanese regime recognises Taiwan also as a province of <span class="highlight">China</span> does not lead us inexorably to the proposition that Taiwan, therefore, in all law, sense and justice is a province of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The native people of Taiwan were ruled briefly by the Spanish, the Portuguese and the Dutch, and then for more than 250 years by Manchu <span class="highlight">China</span> until Japan acquired the island in 1895 and the people of Taiwan - or Formosa, as it used to be called - were not permitted self determination in 1945. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One future possibility is the conquest of Taiwan by mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has declared that Taiwan is a province of <span class="highlight">China</span>, and that, precisely, is what the Canadians were not prepared to do, and that is the heart of the fatal flaw in the approach of the Leader of the Opposition to this vital matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because these high principles are involved in Australia’s national interests and in Australia’s national security, we must support the Prime Minister’s important moves to recognise and to welcome mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> and the present nationalist Chinese rulers will not budge from their claim over Taiwan - what one might call their legalistic claims - this is no ground for Australia to give away other people’s basic rights by selling them to the strongest bidder, without even a fight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No amount of politicking by the Government parties and attempts to throw up  a  smokescreen around the visit of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  to <span class="highlight">China</span> can conceal this one fact, that Australia has lost a real bonanza in its wheat trade to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Running through the PostmasterGeneral’s speech, as through every other speech that has been heard from the other side of the House since the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  went to <span class="highlight">China</span> and deflated the Communist dragon bogy, is the fact that the Government seems to have been searching for some stick with which to beat the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable member for Mallee and those in his section of the Parliament - that is, the Country Party - had taken a more sensible and tolerant view of the recognition of the Peoples’ Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> many years ago, the Australian wheat industry would not be in the plight that it is in today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst I was in South Africa the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam),  together with other Labor and union leaders, were in Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> talking to Chou En-lai. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Churchill once said, it is ‘better to jaw jaw than war war’, and if we can talk to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> and Communist Russia in the hope that we can influence them to change their aggressive policies then so much the better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same time as it advocates increasing dialogue and trade with Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Labor Party has called for a complete boycott of all trade, diplomatic, sporting and cultural relations with anti-Communist South Africa and Rhodesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Surely if it is right to talk to Communist Russia and Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> to change their policies - and I believe that it is - then surely it is right to talk to antiCommunist South Africa if we think it should change its views on apartheid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely if it is right to play ping-pong against Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> in the hope that the contact will make for better relations, then surely it is right to play rugby or cricket against antiCommunist South Africa in the hope that the contact will also make for better relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With England going into the European Common Market it is not only important that we sell wheat to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, about which the honourable member for Dawson  (Dr Patterson)  has such an obsession, but it is also important that we find new trade outlets elsewhere, including South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> has troops and engineers in Tanzania ostensibly to build a railway line, and Chinese Commuist subversion, terror, investment and influence in Zambia, Uganda, the Congo and Guinea are a continuing threat to any hopes of African democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now that we have his Leader’s joy with <span class="highlight">China</span> - the honourable member himself spoke about the hysteria of the Western world in watching the Chinese - should we no longer watch the Chinese? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister for Trade and Industry aware of the announcement by Canada that <span class="highlight">China</span> has just purchased another 500,000 tons of wheat from Canada? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do the Minister and the Government still persist with the explanation that <span class="highlight">China</span>’s decision to purchase wheat from Canada, while again completely wiping Australia, has nothing to do with political considerations or the hostile attitude of the Australian Government to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have made it fairly clear on a number of occasions and, indeed, in this House that if there has been any political difficulty created around the selling of wheat by the Australian Wheat Board to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, much of that difficulty has been created by the honourable member who has asked the question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I beg the honourable gentleman to remain a little quiet, a little patient and to cool down on this subject and give the Australian Wheat Board a chance of negotiating wheat sales with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to say that politics are preventing trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> is not correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks closely at the Canadian contract which has been reported by Reuters, it will be seen that <span class="highlight">China</span> has negotiated to buy 500,000 tons of wheat to be delivered over the next 3 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can assume that there are reasons for <span class="highlight">China</span> stipulating such a short period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> may think that it will have favourable wheat crops or it may be keeping its options open so that it will be able to buy from other countries in the meantime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that if the Labor Party is so concerned about political relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> and with wanting to create goodwill, it might ease the tension that has been produced as a result of the proposed sale of Australian rams to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only country that has not been able to obtain rams from Australia has been the Peoples Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> which has been somewhat offended that, although its representatives have come here in good faith and have tried to purchase these rams, their endeavours have been blocked because of the policy of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I address a question to the Minister for Trade and Industry concerning a letter which the Leader of the Opposition sent out about 3 weeks ago to a large number of businessmen with possible interests in trading with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question to the Prime Minister by saying that it is prompted by the grave concern that I share with all members of the Opposition over the attitude of the  Deputy  Prime Minister who, as recently as yesterday during question time, showed his unwillingness to accept the true reasons for our failures to sell wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Following on the Labor Party’s successful delegation to <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Prime Minister’s subsequent announcement that he would seek dialogue with Chinese leaders, is he able to tell the House how far that dialogue has advanced and whether he has sought or received an invitation to visit <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternatively, would he seek Chinese approval for a joint parliamentary delegation to visit <span class="highlight">China</span> during the next recess in order to prove beyond doubt his Government’s genuine desire to establish full diplomatic recognition in the near future? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure the honourable member that there have been numerous cables received by us from diplomatic sources indicating clearly not only the attitude of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to the statements that have been made by members of the Opposition relating to wheat but also informing us in pretty clear terms that if we want to come to some agreement with them it would be better if we stopped making a political issue of the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Prime Minister whether he is prepared to table in the House or in the Parliamentary Library the cables concerning wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> to which he referred in his answer to the honourable member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had communications from very many sources in recent weeks, mainly representations from ambassadors overseas representing the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What  Mr Chou  En-lai said to me on the question of a revived Geneva Conference and a revived Bandung Conference, and the circumstances in which he spoke on both those subjects, were given by me a couple of days after I left <span class="highlight">China</span> to the Australian Ambasador in Tokyo who saw me with the American Ambassador there and the  Deputy  Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern and Pacific Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then the Leader of the Country Party, the Minister for Trade and Industry  (Mr Anthony),  would no doubt write under the title ‘Has anybody here seen Kelly’ or ‘I’d like to get you on a slow boat to <span class="highlight">China</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me refer now to wheat sales to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We refer to the hypocrisy of members of the Country Party for criticising Red <span class="highlight">China</span> and its policies, on the one hand, while sending emissaries there to sell our products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now he is in favour of selling wheat to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, and conditions have not changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot help feeling disturbed when one reads, for instance, of the late  Mr Moroney,  of the Australian Wheat Board, receiving a nice cheque from Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span>, worth $48m, for Country Party wheat, although <span class="highlight">China</span> is said to be an enemy which the Government is conscripting boys to fight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Every member of this Parliament knows that <span class="highlight">China</span> has now developed a nuclear bomb but that country does not have the skill to deliver it to a target more than 3,000 miles away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Mallee spoke about the sale of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the world gets set for a rush on the <span class="highlight">China</span> market, Australia looks like being left behind, which is about all she deserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will now refer to the ‘Far Eastern Economic Review’ which quotes the attitude of the new Australian Prime Minister,  Mr McMahon,  in relation to Australia’s recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Premier William McMahon said Peking must first meet certain obligations before Australia could extend diplomatic recognition to <span class="highlight">China</span>: These include not trying to achieve political objectives by, force, not using insurgency and guerilla tactics in neighbouring countries, and letting those countries determine their own futures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>; Secondly, there is the developing military and nuclear power of <span class="highlight">China</span> together wilh her history of helping subversion and insurgency movements throughout South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps now that the Labor Party has wooed <span class="highlight">China</span> it is confident that there is no threat, that we can disband everything and that we now accept where our responsibilities and our friends are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for La Trobe has suggested that <span class="highlight">China</span> has the atomic bomb and therefore it is necessary to have 12,000 extra men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite sure that if we did face a situation in which <span class="highlight">China</span> had the transport capacity to challenge Australia in a war 12,000 men would not make a great deal of difference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this was done in the context of an election campaign, where election fever had to be generated over some kind of issue and the issue was the downward thrust of <span class="highlight">China</span> between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Primary Industry whether the Government or the wool selling organisations have made contact with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> concerning sales of Australian wool? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Wool Commission at that time did, through agents, enter preliminary negotiations with a number of countries including the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we endeavoured to prevent the aggressor from succeeding in Vietnam, <span class="highlight">China</span> did not then possess even the atomic bomb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They even produced coloured pamphlets which portrayed red arrows coming down from <span class="highlight">China</span> threatening Australia, and they created fear in the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 8 major donors (more than$USlm) in order of the size of their assistance programmes were the United States, Germany, France, Australia.Japan, Canada and the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-39-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>: Chinese bilateral assistance in 1970 was $US1, 171,040 and was primarily in the fields of agriculture (vegetable seeds, vaccines, water pumps, sprayers and other equipment); power (study or construction of a number of electric power projects); public works (including the continuation of the dredging project in the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-39-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> has a huge potential though it grows a lot of fruit of its own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the proposal for an East Asian market, including, if we can, Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AH the wheat which the Government sold to <span class="highlight">China</span> was not carried on a Conference ship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things which <span class="highlight">China</span> did, so far as Australian wheat was concerned, was to say: ‘No deal on freight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right honourable gentleman also, in exculpation of his Minister’s statement 2 days ago in New York to the AmericanAustralian Association, referred to my conduct in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister stated that, in <span class="highlight">China</span>, I raised matters of political dispute in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister of <span class="highlight">China</span> made this statement: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably because your excellencies are here the Australian Prime Minister declared yesterday that the establishment of diplomatic relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> is far ofl now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister of <span class="highlight">China</span> then said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is probably because your Party is in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say even to the credit of my opponents, they are catching up with the realities of life on <span class="highlight">China</span> to a certain extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know Dulles’s policies have failed dismally and if  President  Nixon says he wants to visit <span class="highlight">China</span>, can  Mr McMahon  be far behind? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When if was raised, I turned it as well as I could to make it plain that my Party would welcome the normalisation of diplomatic relations between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span> if that could be brought about by the present Government also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear - and it is known to the right honourable gentleman if he has read his papers and to the relevant Ministers if they have read their papers - that far from insulting the Japanese before or during, they in fact welcomed very much what I had said in <span class="highlight">China</span> and what I was saying in Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this House last week I asked the Minister for Primary Industry a question concerning the investigation of sales of wool to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, with 750 million people, could provide a market for 1 million bales of wool if that market could be broken into. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we will have to investigate the possibility soon of creating an Asian common market with Australia, New Zealand and Japan the key figures in such a market and with <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Philippines, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Indonesia forming the other partnerships, for we now have to face the big trade blocs throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for the chimera of <span class="highlight">China</span>, with anything between 700 million and 800 million people, its contribution to world trade is $4.2 billion which is a little more than that of Australia at $4.1 billion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, we have had credits of more than $4,500m with countries such as Japan, the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and East European countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A more recent case was when he made so many boo-boos in statements about the visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> of the Australian Labor Party delegation that he wanted a particular government department to give them its blessing by having them issued at departmental level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the emissaries have now returned from the area, I ask the right honourable gentleman when he expects to be able to announce the full membership and itinerary of the projected trade mission to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that sales have been at a record level in spite of moves at a political level surrounding the market in the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On what occasions and by what persons have visits been made or proposed to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> on behalf of Qantas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The following visits have been made to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> on behalf of Qantas: December 1957,  Mr G.  Howling, Sales Manager, Orient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, has he received any communication from the United States  President  seeking the Prime Minister’s OK for this visit in view of the fact that he expressed concern at the President’s proposed visit to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> without first informing him? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should have competent men running a statutory authority, negotiating shipping rates, writing contracts in the currency most favourable to Australia, actually owning the wool, entering into bilateral agreements with foreign countries by going directly to Russia, <span class="highlight">China</span> or some other place and trying to sell the type of wool that those countries want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to mention one that has been thought of by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilation Administration mission which went to <span class="highlight">China</span> way back in 1947. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of that mission thought of what could be done in relation to <span class="highlight">China</span> even as long ago as 1947. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The objective would be to sell to <span class="highlight">China</span> each year raw wool to be processed there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are people in <span class="highlight">China</span> who are interested in this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We arc still selling more goods to <span class="highlight">China</span> than many other countries which do recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many countries who do not recognise <span class="highlight">China</span> at all are selling vast quantities of goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it will not do so well in the sophisticated countries of western Europe and North America, but it may do better in countries like <span class="highlight">China</span> and those in eastern Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely in 1971, when consideration is being given to the admission of <span class="highlight">China</span> to membership of the United Nations, members should be able to ask questions about and express praise of countries which have ideologies different from our own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>by leave - As we have made plain for many months and as we have asserted in the speeches delivered on Australia’s behalf in the General Assembly and by the resolutions we have co-sponsored, we have supported the representation of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in the General Assembly and their occupation of the seat on the Security Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are therefore pleased that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> will now be enabled to be represented in the United Nations and take the seat on the Security Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the vote on the Albanian resoluion no vote will now be taken on the dual representation resolution of which Australia was also co-sponsor with 18 other countries, and which in its terms would have provided for the representation of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and its taking the seat on the Security Council and would also have provided for the continued representation of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> on Taiwan did not announce whether in the event of one form of motion being carried it would adopt one course or another in remaining in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Lying behind this situation is the fear that Pakistan may become <span class="highlight">China</span>’s instrument for disposing of India. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Acting Prime Minister in his capacity as Minister for Trade and Industry whether he has  noted the evidence that there is a possibility of vastly increased markets for Australia in <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and other Communist countries with which trade has been prevented in the past very largely by the narrow cold war political stance that has been taken by his Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, until this year we have been one of the major trading partners of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711102_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet the Minister for Defence tells us that he thought there were more pressing matters before the Prime Minister than a proposal involving the dispatch of Australian troops to Vietnam, a matter involving a switch in Australia’s declared intention to disengage by Christmas from Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, a matter involving our international relations and a matter which he must have known would be at the forefront of any discussions the Prime Minister would have with the United States Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense and maybe the  President  himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is significant because it represents a new phase of involvement in the civil war in Indo <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have in my hands a statement dated Sunday, 5th July 1970, to the Prime Minister, Government and people of the Kingdom of Laos, which bears the signatures of the Minister for Repatriation  (Mr Holten),  as leader of the Australian Parliamentary Mission to Indo <span class="highlight">China</span>,  Senator Bishop,  the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant),  the honourable member for Angas  (Mr Giles),  the honourable member for Evans  (Dr Mackay),  the honourable member for Stirling  (Mr Webb)  and  Senator Young  of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They dealt with matters of fact regarding Cambodia and the war in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> and quoted all of these issues as though they were of no significance at all to the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand, the Labor Party is anxious to support Hanoi and Peking and therefore to curry favour even if it means sacrificing all the victims of Communist aggression within the whole of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we look at the American policy towards <span class="highlight">China</span> we see that a whole new era in international relations is being ushered in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That era of conflict and tension between the United States and <span class="highlight">China</span>, which brought about the conflict in Vietnam, is coming slowly to an end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The United States now is in a position of being prepared to negotiate with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A period of 22 years of conflict and tension between the United States and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is being brought slowly and gradually to an end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the meaning of Nixon’s intended visit to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, there is obviously a desire among the majority of nations to end the cold war conflict, and that has been shown by the fact that after 22 years the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> has been welcomed into the United Nations by an overwhelming majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the 1962 Foreign Assistance Act - there is no foreign assistance for Australia but a lot of the countries were receiving assistance - the Americans define the following countries as Communist: Albania, Bulgaria, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, North Korea, North Vietnam, Outer Mongolia, the Polish Peoples Republic, Rumania, Tibet, Yugoslavia, Cuba and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have in mind the visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> of the Leader of the Opposition and the defence statement, for instance, made since his return. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that most Australians are proud that our Prime Minister has been able to visit Washington, to have these talks, to secure the kind of assurances which have emerged from the talks and, indeed, is going on at this time knowing ahead that  Mr Nixon,  prior to his visit to <span class="highlight">China</span>- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister received any communications from the Japanese Embassy in Australia acclaiming the Leader of the Opposition’s diplomatic offensive on behalf of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it <span class="highlight">China</span> of which we are afraid? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, it would take 10 days to get here from the nearest part of <span class="highlight">China</span>, and the information that they were on their way would seep through the corridors of power and the lobbies and would reach the Minister’s desk and be sent on to the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon),  and eventually we would have a day’s notice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am agreeably surprised by the public acceptance of the admission of <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have the almost incomprehensible position where recently a representative of the Australian Government in the United States virtually chided the American Government because of the liberal policy it was pursuing on the question of <span class="highlight">China</span>, and he was virtually telling the United States Government that American policy on <span class="highlight">China</span> must change if the United States wanted the Liberal Party to be preserved in power in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>that the United States has now developed to a stage where it is negotiating through the person of the  President  himself with the Government of <span class="highlight">China</span>, because this can only do good for South East Asia, our part of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Knowing of the anxiety of farmers in the United States of America to enter the <span class="highlight">China</span> trade and of the hostility of the Chinese to this Australian proposal, what consideration was given by Cabinet to the interests of the Australian exporters? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711110_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Meanwhile, a special envoy from West Pakistan has just returned from <span class="highlight">China</span> and has said unequivocally that <span class="highlight">China</span> is prepared, poised and ready to assist West Pakistan if it becomes necessary to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711110_reps_27_hor75/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should think that that would be no mean task in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711110_reps_27_hor75/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the big problems we have to contend with is our future relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711110_reps_27_hor75/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The double morality has not been entirely on the other side in international affairs because we have taken the view until quite recently that Taiwan represented <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711110_reps_27_hor75/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our Government  is prepared to accept that the Government in Peking should be recognised as the de facto Government of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711110_reps_27_hor75/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government is now saddled with having previously recognised the Nationalist Chinese administration in Taiwan as being the representative of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711110_reps_27_hor75/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One should give credit to  Sir Robert  Menzies, a previous Prime Minister, because in all the time that he used the threat from the north and about <span class="highlight">China</span> sweeping down between the Indian and Pacific Oceans when he was mustering votes for the ballot boxes, he never raised our representation in Taiwan to the level of Ambassador. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711110_reps_27_hor75/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Department is not just following along on the coat tails of the United States to see what will happen when  President  Nixon goes to Peking and what he may be able to negotiate because all the evidence is that <span class="highlight">China</span> will not agree to bettering its relations with Australia diplomatically while Australia continues to recognise Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711110_reps_27_hor75/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does not the call for neutralisation of our region represent a rational response by these nations to the new situation created by the withdrawal of the United States of America from the region and by the re-emergence of <span class="highlight">China</span> as an active, major power in world diplomacy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My comments in this debate on the estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs will deal mainly with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and, of course, its admission to the United Nations and to its rightful place on the Security Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The claim by both the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> that Taiwan is a province of <span class="highlight">China</span> is based on the agreement that was made between President Roosevelt and President Chiang Kaishek at the Cairo conference in November 1943 that Formosa should be restored to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 1st December 1943 in the Cairo Declaration, the United States, the United Kingdom and <span class="highlight">China</span> declared that ‘all territory Japan has stolen from <span class="highlight">China</span> such as Manchuria, Formosa and the Pescadores, shall be restored to the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 8th August 1969 the United States Secretary of State,  Mr Rogers,  gave a clear indication of the United States shift on the 2 Chinas policy when he said that the United States recognised that ‘the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> on Taiwan and Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> on the mainland are facts of life’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We think the realities of the world require that both - the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and Taiwan - be represented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same Press conference, however, he noted the opposing contentions of the Communists and the Nationalists to be the sole government of <span class="highlight">China</span> and representative of the people of <span class="highlight">China</span> and stated that representation in the international organisation need not prejudice the claims or views of either government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We say that the recognition of the true and proper government, the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> on the mainland, is realistic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While the Nationalists and the Communists have been irrevocably antagonistic to each other, they do agree that Taiwan is an integral part of <span class="highlight">China</span> and that there should never be 2 Chinas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 26th July 1971 the Nationalist Ambassador to the United States, James Shen said in a television interview that the Nationalist Government was the sole legitimate representative of all <span class="highlight">China</span> and that Taipei would not give up this claim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet this Government, which says we are only a small country of 12 million people who have lived for so long in the same region as this great population of <span class="highlight">China</span>, has determined that there will be 2 Chinas, even though it determined for so long that there was one <span class="highlight">China</span> only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As 1 said here in debate last week, one of the interesting facts about <span class="highlight">China</span>’s entry to the United Nations is the enthusiasm with which the Chinese apparently are accepting that promotion, if that is it; and with <span class="highlight">China</span> in that body there is a new forum and a new grouping of people to try to find a solution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With a naivety astonishing in someone who hopes to become Australia’s Prime Minister, he gave away in advance every bargaining counter that Australia has in future negotiations with <span class="highlight">China</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will not read out this article now, but it deals with issue after issue arising from  Mr Whitlam’s  visit to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me briefly look at this attitude as it is exemplified in relation to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the issue of foreign aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the Government’s claim that <span class="highlight">China</span>’s willingness to trade with Australia is unaffected by its political considerations is away off beam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently it was clearly stated that unless Australia’s political attitudes change, trade, unless it is considered by <span class="highlight">China</span> to be an absolute necessity, is a dead letter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot play ducks and drakes with its foreign policy in a matter of electoral gain and at the same time hope to gain trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have heard the view that politics and trade do mix in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But even in October 1970, 55 nations had already established diplomatic relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us note some of those that did recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>After all it  ls  the direct lineal successor of the government which, quite gratuituously and against all world trends, decided  as  recently  as  1966 to recognise the Government of Taiwan  as  the government of all <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can one imagine a McMahon conservative Government making the tremendous breakthrough in international relations made by the Prime Minister and Government of Canada in regard to <span class="highlight">China</span>, or will one ever forget the stunned shock of the Australian Government when the announcement was made of President Nixon’s proposed visit to Peking? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course  we all recall  the Prime Minister’s extravagant denunciation of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  and his Australian Labor Party delegation for their bold initiative in trying to make a breakthrough with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Angas  (Mr Giles)  referred to Professor Arndt, a distinguished former member of the Labor Party, who had criticised the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  and the Labor delegation when they went to <span class="highlight">China</span> because in his opinion they left Australia without any options in respect of negotiation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he was making his speech on how we should abandon Taiwan and how Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> - Red <span class="highlight">China</span>, if you wish - is now the mecca of all purity and how we must adopt its ways and carry on its shadow he said: ‘We on this side of the Labor Party . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the honourable member for Reid who is a front bench member of the Labor Party and who is, I presume, a potential Minister - although God help us if Labor ever gets into office - already has stated that Taiwan should be handed back to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But can members opposite tell me when the last democratic election took place in Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> is pure - it is an example to the rest of the world to whom we must now give allegiance, bow down, give in and make approaches so that we might live in peace with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let it be remembered that the Japanese came down through French Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> and the South East Asian area to the fringe of Australia within a period of about 2 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it has shown that it is prepared to play a part and I think it should play a greater part The policy of the Labor Party seems to be to repudiate its friends and to crawl in with Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> because the sooner we are all Communists the better it will be for the whole world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that because members of the Australian Labor Party repudiate the idea that Australia must follow slavishly behind another nation which has been friendly to us in a world war, we are crawling into bed with Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no coherence or logic in the attitude which implies that because one puts a sensible and reasonable case for the legal claims of <span class="highlight">China</span> to the island of Taiwan, Quemoy or Matsu, therefore, one is crawling into bed with somebody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, our Government was in advance of the United States in making statements to the effect that Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> should be taken into the Security Council after its admission to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, the policy of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  has been to accept Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>’s position on Formosa, or Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This woolly euphoria and isolationism is bound up in wild expressions such as, ‘Since the United States is withdrawing totally from Asia, we must’, ‘<span class="highlight">China</span> has joined the United Nations and dropped all its old policies’; ‘Great powers will never again become involved in South East Asia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The USSR, as we know, has recently increased its role and I would think it is inevitable that <span class="highlight">China</span> will ultimately pay still greater attention to its external role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result of my visit, the Australian Government now has a deeper appreciation of American and British thinking on a wide range of international issues of importance to us, such as: The British entry in the EEC; the future of <span class="highlight">China</span> and Taiwan; the future for Vietnam and Cambodia; the Soviet presence in the Indian Ocean; overseas trade; President Nixon’s forthcoming visits to Moscow and Peking; the international monetary situation; and the Rhodesian situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can rest assured that, as the newspapers have already reported, wheat farmers in America are becoming a powerful lobby whose aim is to make the sale of substantial quantities of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> the first means of improving relationships between the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my view it is nonsensical for the Australian Government to continue with this highly dogmatic and ideological approach Which is also determined by fear of that minority in the Democratic Labor Party which dominates the foreign policy of this Government, lt is a luxury that this nation can no longer afford and it is time that Australia recognised that our interests, both diplomatically and economically, are best served by recognising the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister had pointed out the need for a relationship between the United States the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Japan and Europe that would enhance the security of medium and small powers, of which, of course, Australia is one, medium and small countries that may be small in size and in material resources but which are nevertheless significant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The key to the future of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> is North Vietnam and the relations of the rest of the world with North Vietnam, or the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as it calls itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only hope, and I repeat it for the benefit of the honourable member, of assuring peace in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> is to open negotiations with the parties involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Once all our troops are out ii will not be possible for Australia to wash its hands of IndoChina. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A year ago it would have been unthinkable that this Government would go as far along the road to rapprochement wilh the Peoples’ Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> as it has gone in recent months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With these observations about the nature of Australia’s future role in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, I move the following addition to the resolution before the House: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the following words be added to the motion - and also endorses the promise of the Prime Minister that Australian troops will not again be involved in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>T believed the statements - and some of the stuff came from the Department of External Affairs - which indicated that <span class="highlight">China</span> was really involved in Vietnam, until, staggeringly, at a later stage in history we had the late Prime Minister,  Mr Harold  Holt, saying in this House, after the Government had been twitted and twitted about the level of government trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>, that the Chinese were not involved in the war in South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The addendum moved by the Opposition compliments the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  in effect on his promise that Australian troops will not be involved in future in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us be done, whatever else we think about the situation in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, with the view that the Government of North Vietnam has been disposed of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I submit to this House that this Government is not able to trade with countries like <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government of <span class="highlight">China</span> is not willing to trade with a government of the political complexion of this Government which has a bias on political questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it will do so in the long term, because in the long term I believe that a strong single marketing authority will bc able to negotiate bilateral agreements with the European Economic Community countries, with Japan, wilh <span class="highlight">China</span> and with Russia- with the Communist bloc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But beyond the indescribable sufferings facing millions of people in the subcontinent, it is essential that the great powers, particularly the Soviet Union, the Peoples Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the United States, do not become further and directly involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally significant about the new period and relationships is the fact that the first time <span class="highlight">China</span> has acted in the Security Council she has aligned herself with the United States and Japan in opposition to the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When does the right honourable gentleman expect to be able to announce the full membership and itinerary  ot  the projected trade mission to the Peoples’ Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are not the law enforcement authorities entitled to be fed up with the situation that arises when they come into possession of a suspected person whom they interrogate and then find in his possession a package containing a narcotic substance and on the outside of the package the words Manufactured in the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>’ or ‘Manufactured in <span class="highlight">China</span>’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the law presently stands there must be direct and conclusive evidence of importation, and the fact that an article is labelled ‘Made in <span class="highlight">China</span>’, ‘Made in Thailand’, ‘Made in India’, ‘Made in Pakistan’ or ‘Made in Erehwon’ is not evidence of importation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summing up, I repeat again the Labor Party’s complete opposition to any further military participation of any sort in the Indo <span class="highlight">China</span> wars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the accession of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations, there is a totally different diplomatic scenario. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have ascertained that this card was one of a number forwarded from Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> to a Melbourne importer, all similarly headed but with varying compositions shown on the cards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-57-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, an examination of entries made during the last twelve months for piece goods alleged to be of wool or containing wool, from Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, has shown only four such importations, these from the exporter supplying the samples in question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-57-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the fact that the Soviet Union is never likely to be a threat to the integrity of Australia whereas Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> might pose such a threat twenty or more years hence, will he do everything possible to encourage peaceful relations in trade, tourism, culture, medicine, literature and science with the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-32-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At no stage did we receive any official representations from the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were fiddled around for some considerable time until, knowing - I believe - that we had been one of the chief advocates for the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> becoming a member of the General Assembly and also- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They said that in the <span class="highlight">China</span> of that time the army had a pervasive influence throughout the whole of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe also that once Australia can normalise its relationships with <span class="highlight">China</span> there will be excellent opportunities for Australia to send raw materials to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When 1 was in <span class="highlight">China</span> I found that in the densely populated areas such as Cantin, Shanghai and Peking milk products were a scarce commodity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one can appreciate, in a country like <span class="highlight">China</span> there is a definite limit on livestock production, particularly of the dairy type. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On those pages, two great matters, Australia’s future relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> and Australia’s attitude to apartheid, merge into  a  single issue, the truthfulness of the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When does the right honourable gentleman expect to be able to announce the full membership and itinerary of the projected trade mission to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead, the Prime Minister chose to give a tortuous, smart-aleck reply - a farrago of gratuitous sneers at <span class="highlight">China</span>, ambiguities and assertions which fall before the most elementary tests of truthfulness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They said that in the <span class="highlight">China</span> of that time the army had a pervasive influence throughout the whole of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>from our side, anyway, there was never any indication given by the Chinese that they required  Mr Peacock  to resign his portfolio before he visited <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No, the Foreign Minister says, the Prime Minister was wrong in saying that they gave the pervasive influence of the People’s Liberation Army in <span class="highlight">China</span> as the reason why the then Minister for the Army had to resign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be abnormal for a Minister to make such a visit but everything in our relations, or lack of them, with <span class="highlight">China</span> is abnormal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parallel between this and the <span class="highlight">China</span> matter is this: In both cases the Prime Minister had an identifiable motive, and in both cases he has done damage to Australia in pursuit of his aim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I first got to know of this on 1st September when my colleague the now Minister for External Territories  (Mr Peacock)  came to me and told me that  Mr Kibel  had contacted him about a possible visit to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can state specifically that  Mr Kibel  on the 14th did state that in his belief one of the reasons why the then Minister for the Army was invited was the pervasive influence of the Army in <span class="highlight">China</span> at that date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were interested in showing him <span class="highlight">China</span> and having mutually beneficial discussions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was titled a private visit, but of course  Mr Bowen  and  Mr McMahon  are absolutely right, there’s no doubt that converstations  that he would have in <span class="highlight">China</span> would be with all the right people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This motion has immense relevance to the Government’s conduct of relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, surely the most vital issue of external policy confronting Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of limited time, I want to concentrate my remarks on the issues raised by the Prime Minister’s comments in the Parliament last Thursday on a ministerial visit to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the issues raised go directly to the heart of conduct of our relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in the past year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems the Prime Minister recognised the essential nobility of the concept of  President  Nixon’s mission to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, he did not recognise the shambles which passes for Australia’s relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In saying this I do not intend to be disparaging of the Kibel brothers who seem to have been the Government’s main emissaries to <span class="highlight">China</span> in the past few months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But other nations of the world of no greater status or significance than Australia are approaching <span class="highlight">China</span> at head of Government or senior diplomatic level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government clearly lacks the courage or even the hide to make a direct approach to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, it has had the option at any time in the past year to make a direct approach to <span class="highlight">China</span> and to send a ministerial delegation to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> would not have rejected an official approach for a member of the Government to go to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Prime Minister and Leader of the Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  would have been an ideal person to go to <span class="highlight">China</span> on behalf of his Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also the stake his Party has in improving trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as this Government and relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> are concerned, the parade has gone by. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next official visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> will be by the Leader of the Opposition as Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Government has not the competence to get even a trade mission to <span class="highlight">China</span>, let alone a junior Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the context of a disastrous series of diplomatic setbacks for the Prime Minister and his Government over relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was disclosed a week later in the National Times’ that the Prime Minister had rejected an invitation by the Chinese to have a member of his Ministry go to <span class="highlight">China</span> for 10 days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It became clear that the Government, in seeking to get a trade mission to <span class="highlight">China</span>, had hooked a rather bigger fish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chinese had invited  Mr Peacock  and his wife to go to <span class="highlight">China</span>, apparently on the recommendation of the brothers Kibel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems they regarded him as one of the less reactionary members of the Australian Government and were prepared to bring him to <span class="highlight">China</span> and ensure he met the right people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister says also that an Army Minister would be put in a schizophrenic position by visiting <span class="highlight">China</span> while Australian troops were engaged in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He neglects to explain how the American President - as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out - who is the supreme authority - the supreme commander - for conduct of the Vietnam War avoided a spectacular division in his personality while he was in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not seem possible for Australia to get even a trade mission to <span class="highlight">China</span> while this Government stays in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us go to 24th February when the Prime Minister was asked a question relating to this ministerial visit to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They said that in  Ihe  <span class="highlight">China</span> of that time the army had a pervasive influence throughout the whole of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not a condition imposed by <span class="highlight">China</span> or an official representative of <span class="highlight">China</span> or a nonofficial representative of <span class="highlight">China</span> and there is no other construction open if one reads the answer as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only when mischief is sought to be made by raising in the House our relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> in either this form or in relation to wheat sales that harm will result to Australia in its relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that in relation to our sales of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> there has been a long campaign of deliberate mischief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently the honourable member for Dawson  (Dr Patterson)  had the idea of visiting <span class="highlight">China</span> with a view, I suggest, to embarrassing this Government over wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So persistent is this attempt to make mischief that quite recently when the Leader of the Opposition was overseas he took the trouble during a discussion with a representative of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in New York to discuss the question of wheat sales and he received from that representative an assurance that there would be no sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> preceding recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition announced this and then announced that he would recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has gone out of his way to receive and publicise something highly detrimental to this country in relation to wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> for purely political motives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other matters that call the credibility of the Prime Minister into question are his relations with the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Peacock)  and the whole question of what really has been going on in regard to this proposed visit to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt, in the next few weeks we will see just how rauch  Mr Kibel’s  visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> and Hong Kong actually cost the Australian taxpayer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I have written a paper on the law of <span class="highlight">China</span> and I will send the honourable member a copy, if he likes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720301_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure the honourable member that the position in <span class="highlight">China</span> is quite different from that in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720301_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday afternoon the right honourable gentleman told us of information which he had received from Hong Kong on 7th September last about 2 matters - firstly, the possible visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> by the Minister for the Army, and secondly, to use his words ‘a private trade mission which we were only too happy to arrange’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720301_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask him now: What progress has the Government made with the arrangements for this private trade mission to <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720301_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some time we were in negotiation to try to ensure that an Australian trade mission led by a very distinguished Australian should go to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720301_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That article stated that goods had been flooding in from cheap labour countries and industry leaders claimed that they could land in Australia cheap garments made in <span class="highlight">China</span>, Hong Kong and Singapore at about half the cost of manufacturing them in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the subject of trade between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all would like to see expanded trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the type of products we can sell to <span class="highlight">China</span> is limited wheat, wool and semi-finished mineral products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the representatives of <span class="highlight">China</span> made it quite clear to the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  and myself when we were there that they would expect Australia to play its part and to take some of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What products can <span class="highlight">China</span> export under a bilateral arrangement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I bought back from <span class="highlight">China</span> a pair of pure leather shoes which cost 92c Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the type of commodity that <span class="highlight">China</span> can supply to us, providing it is a 2-way agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this instance we can sell our wheat and our wool to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is completely fallacious to compare the wage standards in Australia with the wage standards in <span class="highlight">China</span>, Hong Kong or anywhere else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is completely fallacious simply to argue that because we can import a shirt from <span class="highlight">China</span> or Hong Kong for 20c we must scrap all our cotton and processing industries in Australia to import cheap shirts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Taiwanese, and the people from Hong Kong and Red <span class="highlight">China</span> do not provide a wide variety of fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>President  Nixon’s announcements on <span class="highlight">China</span> and the United States dollar parity adjustments constitute a watershed in world foreign and economic relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take the example of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>’s total trade is about 25 per cent less than that of Hong Kong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hong Kong has about 5 million people; <span class="highlight">China</span> has between 700 million and 800 million. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> has a selfcontained subsistence economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that we ought to get our textiles from <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, might I prognosticate we ought to get our textiles perhaps from <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the first part of the honourable gentleman’s question, 1 have said before that 1 believe that in our pursuit of a dialogue in order to have better bi-lateral relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> we must proceed in a cautious and, indeed, a quietly diplomatic way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to see trade develop between Australia and New Zealand, i want to see trade develop between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us take trade between, say, <span class="highlight">China</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to sell our wheat, wool and other products to <span class="highlight">China</span>, but if we have to take into Australia in return a flood of low cost commodities which will bankrupt hundreds of thousands of workers in Australia, we on this side of the Parliament would not under any circumstances tolerate it until there was a plan by which these resources could be shifted effectively and profitably as far as the people are concerned, whether they be employee or employer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he wish to oust New Zealand in favour of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously we will have closer associations with <span class="highlight">China</span> later but regard must be had to our sister nations in the Pacific area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to a statement by  Mr James  Kibel that if he told the true story regarding the negotiations with Chinese officials over the proposed visit of the former Minister for the Army to <span class="highlight">China</span> the Government would be forced to resign? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fortuitously or otherwise, the replacement of the market in the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> by the market in the United Arab Republic has resulted in the latter country taking approximately 20 per cent of Australia’s wheat export. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These countries include <span class="highlight">China</span>, Egypt, Russia and Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is worthy of note that the Australian Wheat Board has looked for new markets in this field and has successfully fo ind them, despite the lack of sales to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> - if that is the latest term that should be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> might be the popular name today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>’ I used previously, and it is not a bad name. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He estimated last year - that is, a year ago - that if the Board made its sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> we could end last season with a carry over of 1 19 million bushels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the dairying industry, which has revolutionised our exports to <span class="highlight">China</span> and other Asian countries, the Wheat Board stands as our most experienced and expert seller of our products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Wheat Board has had its hands tied behind its back for many years because of the attitude of this Government to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Board has had my gratitude throughout these years because it was out fighting for markets in a country that was not recognised by this Government, the Government that at this moment is backing the Wheat Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has been deliberately insulting to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> over the last 20 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During those long years the Wheat Board has tried to sell wheat to that country at a time when the Government was condemning the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> left, right and centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally last year the Wheat Board found the doors closed in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Referring to recent attempts at contact between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Australia,  Senator Sim  said he was appalled by the thought that two businessmen brothers could have been acting for the Australian Government in <span class="highlight">China</span> or that their opinion seemed to carry weight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>‘Sending Andrew Peacock (Territories Minister) to <span class="highlight">China</span> would be really stupid’, he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I rather gather that what the honourable gentleman is complaining about regarding our policy towards <span class="highlight">China</span> is that it differs from that of the United States, and that what he wants us to do is to follow  President  Nixon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that question time is the time to debate foreign policy at any length, but I can assure the honourable gentleman that the Government, with caution and in a proper way, is making approaches to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and I do not think that any good purpose is served by discussing the details of these approaches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the result of the President’s visit, we are hopeful that the approach of  President  Nixon to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> will lead in the long run to some reduction of tension in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its overseas trade is the same as that of the whole of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and it is now largely able to look after its own defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this Is going to work mainly because after the communique between the US and <span class="highlight">China</span>, this area, South East Asia, will not be in the foreseeable future an area either of conflict or confrontation among the big powers … it makes the five-powers defence arrangements fairly irrelevant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whom we all know to be the Foreign Minister of Singapore -  has maintained - and I agree with him - that <span class="highlight">China</span> is not aggressive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I will quote from a publication called The Asian’ in which  Mr Rajaratnam  had this to say about <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> is not economically or even militarily in a position to give any kind of direct aid to revolutionary movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are now 5 major power groupings: The United States of America, the Soviet Union, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Japan and the European Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this is a far cry from assuming that things like  Mr Nixon’s  trip to <span class="highlight">China</span> mean that we are in a new golden age where human nature has also taken a great leap forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall how the senator reflected in the grossest possible terms on the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  because of the stupidity of his <span class="highlight">China</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it is <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know that all the circumstances of the last 20 years have shown up the eccentricities of our policy; that our Vietnam policy on which we squandered so many lives and so much treasure did not mean a thing when it came to the crunch and the Americans were going home; that our <span class="highlight">China</span> policy did not mean a thing when  President  Nixon changed his course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 9th March I asked the Prime Minister a question without notice in which I drew attention to a statement by  Senator Sim, chairman  of the Senate Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, that the right honourable gentleman’s last statements on <span class="highlight">China</span> were unwise, in fact a stupidity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In December 1971 no opposition was offered by the ACTU nor any unionist to the export by ship of 29 rams to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> consigned ex the Port of Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government does not intend indefinitely to leave the question of delivery of rams sold within the agreed terms of relaxation of the ban to be determined by the whim of the ACTU and the Labor Party, particularly as the whim is orientated in one direction where the sales are to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> and another when elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then the Minister has what I think are very serious things to say about our trade, particularly with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had again a pattern of attacking <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But is it not incredible that the Minister for Trade and Industry  (Mr Anthony),  on the very first day that he took over this portfolio, sought to denigrate and smear <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, he said he would not jeopardise his soul to sell wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not sure of the state of his soul, but I know that we have not sold any wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a poor thing to say when we have an industry which hopes to join the world rush for trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that we as members of this Parliament have a responsibility to see to it that we are not out of step with the march of time now in regard to trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a reprehensible situation to find that sales have been made from Australia to overseas countries, including <span class="highlight">China</span>, much as the Government may not like it, and contracts have been entered into in a situation of complete indecision by the Government, the Parliament and the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Riverina at one stage had me worried a bit when he got on to wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard some discussion about the fact that the Australian Council of Trade Unions has allowed  -  I put the word allowed’ in inverted commas - the export of sheep to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> but to no other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidently it is all right to allow these sheep to go to <span class="highlight">China</span> but the ACTU is deliberately denying the export of these sheep to countries such as India. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The United States of America maintains its global balance with the Soviet Union and it has a marked superiority in strategic nuclear strength vis-a-vis <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The United States, the Soviet Union, <span class="highlight">China</span> and Japan are exploring each other’s attitudes and examining the effect of initiatives taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the present situation of uncertainty about the intentions of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union, and the aggressive militancy of the North Vietnamese throughout IndoChina, and widespread insurgency in our northern neighbourhood, a positive Australian policy founded on an adequate defence effort and on defence arrangements or understandings with our neighbours may contribute to confidence and stability in the region in which we live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To lay stress on dangerous contingencies against which Australian defence efforts must steadily prepare over the longer term is not inconsistent wi.h the hopes entertained by the  President  of the United States of progressively negotiating understandings which will reduce tensions among the 4 great powers: The Soviet Union, the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, the United States and Japan - and particularly among the 3 great military powers in this group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In South East Asia the impact of subversion and insurgency has been restricted by massive sacrifices of men and material on the part of many countries - not least the states of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> under attack from North Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>’s military power is of growing rather than lessening importance in Australian security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to return, however, to the subject of <span class="highlight">China</span>, whose military inventory contains a good deal more than nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Defence Review has pointed to the expansion of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s conventional naval and air forces and to the modernisation of all three of the Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While these forces are organised today essentially for the defence of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s borders, they already possess some offensive potential and it is clear that this capability will be developed further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the foundation for maintaining an effective balance of power in relation to a nuclear arming <span class="highlight">China</span> - a consideration of great concern for Australia in the years immediately ahead as will be seen from the description of the subject in the Defence Review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no comparable restraints on the growth of the mobile strategic strength of the Sovietnor on the unannounced expansion of the land, maritime and nuclear forces of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is necessary to remind ourselves, because we tend to forget about these things, that when the Second World War ended every independent country in South East Asia was ravaged by internal communist aggression and that very often this aggression was aided by either <span class="highlight">China</span> or Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By 1965 - it is interesting to think back on this because up to that time North Vietnam was denying that she was taking any active participation in the action or the aggression which was taking place in South Vietnam - it became obvious that, with the active support of and propped up by Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span>, the North Vietnamese had in many ways overrun the south and the South Vietnamese were unable to help themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that almost all Australians have been withdrawn from Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> and it appears that Americans are being withdrawn, we are being asked to conclude that it was all worth while. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the documents to which I have referred and many others show that the war in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, carried on by Americans and Australians, has always been an unjustifiable, immoral,, illegal and even criminal war, and it remains so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among them were whether what was being fought was aggression from the North or a movement strongly supported by the people of Vietnam and Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>; whether the war that began in South Vietnam had been started by the people in South Vietnam oi whether it had been started and carried on by North Vietnam; and then whether the war in South Vietnam had been started by the Diem Government by attacking those it called communists, or whether it had been started by an attack by those called communists upon the Diem Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Australia was wrong to go into the war in IndoChina, and those who have died in that war have unfortunately died in a bad cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of its guilt in the war in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, far more than for any other reason, the Government of Australia should be rejected by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This great question about guilt in the war in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> cannot be answered only on the basis of recent years, or on cliches such as those which we have just heard from the honourable member for Bennelong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The war in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> did not begin in 1965 when Australians were sent there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It did not begin in 1954 when Americans were sent there, or in 1945 when the French returned, or in 1941 when the Japanese invaded Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It began at least as early as 1847 when a French naval expedition arrived and in 70 minutes killed more people than had been killed in 2 centuries of war in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> before that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The war in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> in which Australians became involved in 1965 and Americans in 1954 can be understood only if we realise that Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> had been occupied by foreign powers for over a hundred years and that resistance against them had never ceased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first stage of the war in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> was at an end by about 1890. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now the Indo-Chinese nationalist middle class, and intellectuals, were no longer able to lead the fight against the French with guns but turned to politics and to Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span> for aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fully documented evidence of the Pentagon Papers shows that the EisenhowerDulles Administration rejected the Geneva Agreement and its election, set up the Diem Government and began immediately to supply it with military power for only one reason - so that it could immediately set out to destroy the communists, as it was put, in South Vietnam and equally as much elsewhere in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The eighth and last stage of the war in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> began with Nixon’s hidden war of the automated electronic battlefield. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me remind the gentlemen on the Government side that because of their fears of the downward thrust of <span class="highlight">China</span> they wanted new friends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia have a veto on such decisions by the United Nations and they are the countries which will increasingly have nuclear submarines and missile-equipped ships off our very coast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party wants to pull out of ANZUK and bring the troops home from Malaysia and Singapore, choosing to forget Lee Kuan Yew’s words that if Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> fell to the North Vietnamese then the rest of South East Asia would soon go through the Communist mincing machine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have <span class="highlight">China</span> emerging with great manpower, but at present lacking in weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps we have to face threats from <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The White Paper states that <span class="highlight">China</span> at present is working on the production of nuclear propelled submarines and it also states that not later than 1975 <span class="highlight">China</span> will have intercontinental ballistic missiles with a range of 3,000 miles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not say that the threat will come from <span class="highlight">China</span>, but 1 say that here is a super power in our area which has not in the past been friendly to us and against which we may - I hope we do not - need protection, and we will have to turn to the Americans for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The overall world situation on radioactive fallout is, therefore, that the only new injections of this material into the atmosphere, currently, are from testing by France and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, we have the Leader of the Opposition when he visited <span class="highlight">China</span> last year supporting, as I understand it, the substance of the 7 points put forward by the provisional revolutionary government of South Vietnam for settling the war there - proposals which the  President  of the United States has reportedly described as joining with your enemies in order to destroy your friends’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what Government policy on indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> has come to - empty words as a substitute for any action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ambassador in Peking - the most experienced diplomat from Europe in all the affairs of <span class="highlight">China</span> and of that region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Russia, much more than <span class="highlight">China</span>, has been responsible for supplying the means of war to Hanoi. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the whole basis of the Government’s propaganda, the only way this wretched war and our futile, wasted commitment to it could have been sold to the Australian people was by depicting it as a long distance war against <span class="highlight">China</span> - a war to stop the downward thrust of Chinese communism between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the villain of the piece had to be <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tanks, the surface-to-air missiles, or SAMs, all the sophisticated weaponry there now - the things that have made what was a guerrilla war into a massive war between 2 of the largest and best equipped armies of the world today - have been brought about not by <span class="highlight">China</span> but by the Soviet Union and by the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has always been to support every move to get a political settlement of the war and to end the war, not only in Vietnam but in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, and that Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> should be neutralised in the ideological contest among the super powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I repudiate is any view which does not record our objection to and rejection of any action, by either side - not just by the Vietnamese but by all the powers, namely, the United States, the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span>, who in pursuit of utterly mistaken ideas of national interest have hurled Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> into this crucible of blood - which prolongs the sacrifice and suffering of the people of Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen them support <span class="highlight">China</span> rather than their own country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would rather support <span class="highlight">China</span> than our ally, the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But even then their hypocrisy was obvious because at that stage, they traded with communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed they are falling over backwards to enter into some negotiation with <span class="highlight">China</span> now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the qualification that one cannot guarantee the accuracy of the figures, I can say that the evidence at the moment points to the “fact that the Soviet Union would have supplied aid to North Vietnam to the extent of SI, 000m in the past year whereas the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> would have provided aid to the extent of about $300m in that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In so doing he assailed the Government’s Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> policy in terms which ripped it to tatters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There seems a determined attitude on the part of North Vietnam to prove to the United States and <span class="highlight">China</span> that it can go it alone for an extended period if need be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second reason is to impress the allies of North Vietnam - ‘the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> - of its capacity to strike at this time and to involve them, particularly at a time when the United States  President  is visiting the capitals of those 2 countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Russia, much more than <span class="highlight">China</span>, has been responsible for supplying the means of war to Hanoi. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has been saying consistently that it is a war of aggression supported by Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span> and we have been condemning this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One does not want to go into a long dissertation on history, but it is a fact that the Government of France, having been defeated by the Germans in the Second World War, attempted to reassert its sovereignty over Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> in a way that other countries such as Britain had learnt was no longer relevant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can remember those Liberal pamphlets, ‘ Government pamphlets, usually printed in blue but for this purpose printed in red or perhaps yellow, showing arrows extending down towards Australia with the explanation that this was the thrust of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Equally, <span class="highlight">China</span> has not the slightest reason to regret United States involvement in Vietnam, and the whole of American policy now is directed to getting out of Vietnam with honour and then deploying her strength in the areas of confrontation that do matter, and the areas of confrontation that do matter are the Middle East and Eastern Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for her attitude towards <span class="highlight">China</span>, President Nixon has followed the rather amazing policy of discussing with <span class="highlight">China</span> India’s possession of Kashmir - an extremely dangerous policy because if it led to anything, it could bring <span class="highlight">China</span> over the Himalayas into Kashmir. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for this is that the US is trying to exploit the divisions between the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>General de Gaulle believed that a ‘union des patries’, a united Europe, would be possible because the Soviet Union was distracted on her eastern border by <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To support <span class="highlight">China</span> in that distraction has become America’s policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So all the commentaries over recent years about Chinese involvement in Vietnam and about America really opposing <span class="highlight">China</span> in Vietnam, not a minor communist power, like so many other things in American policy, will be disposed of in a 180 degrees turn in foreign policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was the Prime Minister asked by the Australian Table Tennis Association to express formal Government approval of a proposed visit by a table tennis team from the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact also appears in the reports coming to me that, with the massive support of Russia and the support of <span class="highlight">China</span>, North Vietnam is making an all out effort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increased pressure of textiles from the Orient is most obvious from the following figures: In 1967-68 Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> exported textiles worth $14.4m into Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister received any questions or representations with respect to the attitude of the Australian Labour Party or the Australian trade union movement concerning the testing of atomic weapons by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No, I have not received any suggestions or representations from the Australian Labor Party that we should protest against the tests in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the House will know, there has been published recently by the Institute of Strategic Studies an assessment of the progress at present being made with the nuclear programme in the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, both as to the intercontinental ballistic missiles and the movement into nuclear submarines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Significantly  President  Nixon named Russia alone, not <span class="highlight">China</span>, as North Vietnam’s major supplier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the seaward interdiction can only mean total reliance on the <span class="highlight">China</span> route. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The blockade therefore is almost certain to increase North Vietnam’s dependence upon <span class="highlight">China</span> and increase co-operation between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia in continuing the war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Essentially it is because in 1954, after the Geneva agreements which recognised Vietnam as a single country, the United States chose Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> as the place where <span class="highlight">China</span> was to be stopped and where the ideological war between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the United States was to be fought out to the bitter end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the  President  conceded that <span class="highlight">China</span> was not the main outside adversary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tragedy of today’s announcement is that if nothing worse happens, if our worst fears prove unfounded, the war in IndoChina will involve <span class="highlight">China</span> more heavily and directly than it has hitherto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even the 300 tanks collected by General Giap for the present offensive came by rail, overland through <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the ability of Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span> to supply Hanoi will not be drastically reduced in the long run by the interdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On a wide range of great matters, but particularly Vietnam and <span class="highlight">China</span>, he defines a yawning gap between public policies and private knowledge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where does the menace come from in IndoChina. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My answer is - the Viet Minh, not Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was the first significant debate ever to occur in this House on Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The majority of Australian people believe that before Australia becomes involved in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> the whole matter should be thrashed out not between the American and the French on one hand and the Viet Minh and Chinese People’s Republic on the other, but by the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a threat to the peace of the world in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And yet, as I have said, at the very same time Lord Casey was confiding to his diary and, one must assume to Prime Minister Menzies at least, his real view about the nature of the Viet Minh and the impossibility of a military solution in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly Lord Casey reveals his hopes - more than 20 years ago - for early recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As regards recognition of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, I said that the matter had to remain on ice while the Korean affair lasted, but that at some appropriate time after the fighting ended, recognition of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> and her admission into the United Nations seemed a necessary and logical step. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems impossible to believe that any State Department man of consequence (from Dean Acheson down) still believes in Nationalist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>democratic) sponsoring of the entry of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> into the United Nations (whether or not we specifically recognise Red <span class="highlight">China</span> diplomatically) would ease the acid attitude of Peking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> has served the Liberal Party well, and will continue to do so for a long time to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And in the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs this evening we have the full acknowledgement of where 20 years of <span class="highlight">China</span> as a domestic political issue has brought the Liberal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He would take the initiative in severing relations with Taiwan and he would visit Peking as the sole capital of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Straits maintain there is but one <span class="highlight">China</span> and that Taiwan is part of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the governments of Canada and <span class="highlight">China</span> announced on 13th October 1970 that they would exchange diplomatic representatives, their joint communique stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chinese Government reaffirms that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the territory of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Canadian Government recognises the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> as the sole legal government of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas Canada did not endorse or challenge Peking’s position and Italy was not required to express a view upon it, the United States does not challenge the assertion that there is only one government of <span class="highlight">China</span> and that Taiwan is a province of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No amount of twisting or turning about 2 Chinas, about one <span class="highlight">China</span> and one Taiwan, about one and a half Chinas or any of the other newfangled propositions invented over the past year to escape the inevitable will provide escape from this choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no choice about the terms on which we shall have to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eight months ago I was confident that an Australian government - the present Government as much as a Labor government - could achieve full diplomatic relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> on terms as favourable as Canada’s or Italy’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we recognise the People’s Republic as the government of <span class="highlight">China</span>, we automatically cease to recognise the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> - the regime of Chiang Kai-shek - as the government of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How much better would be our situation and our record today if Lord Casey’s insights on Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> and <span class="highlight">China</span> had been followed through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Canada in the Pacific and Herr Brandt in the Atlantic community have been true friends of the United States because they have eased the United States’ path to sane relations, in the one case with <span class="highlight">China</span> and in the other case with the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Japan, with her very special difficulties in reaching normal relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>, cannot hold the ring between these 2 great powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must not lose the opportunity in 1972 that we lost in 1954 - the opportunity for sane relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>, the opportunity for a settlement of the war in Vietnam, the opportunity to institute an era of peace and progress in our region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If so, why has this reduction been made when the question of relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> has become so important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-43-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: Has Australia made any representations to the Soviet Union where, unlike <span class="highlight">China</span>, we have an embassy, in support of the British representations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On this issue of <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam the policies of Australia and the United Kingdom have diverged very considerably. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has often said to me that there is no point in Australians drawing any consolation or comfort from the serious differences of opinion which exist between Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This involves Indian doubt of the prospects of an accord with <span class="highlight">China</span> and Indian fear of <span class="highlight">China</span>, and also Indian criticism of the United States made because of the United States detente towards <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third factor is a consequence of the American detente towards <span class="highlight">China</span> - a new emphasis by the United States on the value of Pakistan as an ally and a chill in Indian-United States relationships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fourth new factor to develop is the United States detente itself towards <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basis of this detente is that the Soviet Union could destroy <span class="highlight">China</span> and could destroy the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to say to the honourable member for Henty that I think the assessment by his friend that the dispute between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union is a dispute as to who is to be ‘the boss’ of the communist world is a very serious error in analysis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally, the Soviet Union suspected that Chinese policy over Cuba in  1962  was an attempt to involve the Soviet Union in a war with the United States in which they would both destroy one another, leaving <span class="highlight">China</span> as the gainer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another new factor is the defeat of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s strategy to disintegrate India. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main instrument in <span class="highlight">China</span>’s strategy to disintegrate India was our SEATO ally, Pakistan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the people in the Soviet Union - Ukrainians, Georgians and so forth - in essence are colonial people and ideological comments from <span class="highlight">China</span> aimed at those people are interpreted by the Soviet Union as an attempt to disintegrate the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Krishna Prakash Gupta, who is one of the leading thinkers in the field of Indian foreign policy, had this to say about <span class="highlight">China</span> and the over-simplifications of Chinese policy that are sometimes put forward: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This brings us back to the enigma of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s basic motives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He asked why <span class="highlight">China</span>, on the one hand, embraced military dictatorships like Pakistan and, on the other hand, spoke in terms of liberty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is through these tactics that <span class="highlight">China</span>’s strategy can be easily inferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, most of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s external postures have to do with internal politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is <span class="highlight">China</span> unique in that respect? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am only saying that these attitudes are rather similar to <span class="highlight">China</span>’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitudes that we strike in external policy are in’ fact often for internal consumption, precisely in the same way as is the case with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>President  Nixon is making approaches to the Soviet Union and to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If true peace and national integrity are to be secured on the world scene, the countries constituting the European Communities, the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, will need to arrive at some balance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Foreign Minister continued to speak of New Zealand, Japan, Indonesia, the Indian sub-continent, the South Pacific, Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, Africa and the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This thrust has been assisted by heavy wartime hardware from both Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Even the 300 tanks collected by General Giap for the present offensive came by rail, overland through <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the ability, of Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span> to supply Hanoi will not be drastically reduced in the long run by the interdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When questioned on the proportion of war essential imports that could come into North Vietnam over the rail or road lines from <span class="highlight">China</span>, even if all imports by sea were denied and a strong effort made to interdict ground transport, the State Department reported to President Nixon as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>believe that interdiction of Haiphong and heavy attacks on the rail line from <span class="highlight">China</span> would over time prevent North Vietnam from receiving sufficient economic and military aid to continue the war effort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition concentrated on the war in Vietnam and recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the height of hypocrisy is reached in the Minister’s comments on Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has actively opposed the recognition of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has actively opposed in the past the admission of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  has been reported as saying that <span class="highlight">China</span> has served the Liberal Party well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On <span class="highlight">China</span>, as on every other foreign policy issue, this Government is hopelessly out of step with reality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Prime Minister and other members of the Government have said, Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> still has the smear of the mud that this Government has thrown on it in the years past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> was still carrying out its subversion and insurgency in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look - and the Minister referred specifically to it - at the speech made by the Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> delegate to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as <span class="highlight">China</span>’s economy is still comparatively backward, the material aid we have provided is very limited, and what we provide is mainly political and moral support <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, of course, every time that question of subversion has been raised, honourable members opposite reply back to Lin Piao, who is now somewhat in eclipse in Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> but who has been a whipping horse for this Government in times past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an observation made by the renegades, by the subversives of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I want to make here is that if Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> is regarded as an enemy - and obviously the Government regards <span class="highlight">China</span> as such - then one should analyse very carefully what it says, what it does and what it is capable of doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government supported and continued to support the French in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> has now also moved into a more active diplomatic role that should encourage the normalisation of her relations with other Asian countries on the basis of peaceful coexistence, though she will enter into sharper competiton diplomatically and ideologically with the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The war in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> and the fostering of such concepts as the so-called domino theory have added fuel to Australian fears. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not nearly so exclusively devoted to the situation in Vietnam or Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>; it makes a wide-ranging attempt to look at the situation throughout large areas of the world and to give Australia’s attitudes towards these various situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we can all remember that, when the Mao Tse Tung administration took over in Peking at the end of 1949, it was the view of this Government and the United States Government that it was an agent for the Soviet Union and that this was the eastwards thrust of Soviet Communism into <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The desire of people to obtain their own independence and to run their own affairs as the people of Indonesia, India and the Indian sub-continent, of Ceylon, Burma and many other places were able to do was denied to the people of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> and, from that decision made by the French, all these things have followed through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition in this recent debate says that we have a situation now which is highly dangerous, in which there is confrontation between 2 great world powers and, be said, that that has come about essentially because in 1954 after the General agreements, which recognised Vietnam as a single country, the United States chose Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> as the place where <span class="highlight">China</span> was to be stopped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When techniques are able to use the low wages of Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Vietnam - one of the important purposes of fighting the war in Indo <span class="highlight">China</span> always has been to bring Japanese and American capital together with low wage workers - the result is one with which Australian industry cannot ever compete. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the former Prime Minister,  Sir Robert  Menzies, when announcing the proposed commitment of an infantry battalion for service in South Vietnam, state in the House on 29th April, 1965 (Hansard, page 1061) that the takeover of South Vietnam must be seen as part of a thrust by Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-43-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister ensure that the Government and his Department do nothing to jeopardise the trade in sugar between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span> just as the Government and his Department jeopardised the trade in wheat between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When he stops doing it, remains silent and allows the country to trade and to carry on in a proper and dignified way, as it has done successfully in the past, then we will sell wheat again to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the answer given by the Minister to the honourable member for Dawson, can the Government take any further action which would help to prevent the sale of sugar to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> being made a political issue by the Australian Labor Party and thus jeopardising the continuing trade in this commodity as happened in the case of wheat? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

Cairns),  who is sitting opposite, suggest that he wants the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  to assist by giving $5,000 from his political slush fund to permit the honourable member for Lalor to travel to <span class="highlight">China</span> and place himself in the way of that country’s nuclear tests in the atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have been protesting against both France and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other point made by the Minister was: What have we got to say about the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well I certainly have not stopped <span class="highlight">China</span> from doing it and neither has the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be quite happy to go to <span class="highlight">China</span> to tell the Chinese the same thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have told the French and I would be happy to go to <span class="highlight">China</span> and do it there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all remember the emotion that was engendered in this country when the French nuclear tests were about to take place, but have we ever experienced the equal of it when Russia was about to test or had tested nuclear weapons or when <span class="highlight">China</span> was about to test or have tested nuclear weapons? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have also protested against the continuing testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere by <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I may transgress for a short time, I was about to say that not one member of the Government has taken himself overseas seriously concerned with the marketing problems confronting the people he purports to represent, as have the representatives of Canada in <span class="highlight">China</span> because it represents 90 per cent of their overseas trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is there any evidence anywhere that <span class="highlight">China</span> has that kind of an ambition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the American experts at the conference said that he did not believe - that nobody believed - that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> could even successfully launch an assault upon Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister for Primary Industry seen reports of a statement by the Canadian Minister for Foreign Affairs,  Mr Mitchell  Sharp, in Peking that Canada in future will have first preference on sales of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true, I understand, that there has been  a  suggestion that the Canadians henceforth are to receive initial opportunities for the sale of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is equally true also that over the course of that 10 years Australia has made a greater volume of sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> than has Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also true that, at a time when all members of the wheat industry are becoming increasingly concerned that more and more wheat is being sold on terms, sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> have been on terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Could one imagine a more graceless, a more demeaning performance - surveying mankind from <span class="highlight">China</span> to Peru’ in search of a scapegoat, blaming indiscriminately the Australian employees, the Australian employers, the Australian consuming public but never, never a word of apology, a hint of responsibility for the blunders of himself and his colleagues, and the needless hardships they have caused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I again remind honourable members opposite that <span class="highlight">China</span> wants a variety of wheat that is in short supply in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Had we sold wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> this year, what would have been the position? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are tired of a government that gets its policies from the gallup poll; that reacts to every test of leadership and statesmanship by playing on every prejudice and fear lying dormant in the community; that acts in every national or international crisis only in terms of the political advantage it can squeeze out of it - whether it be <span class="highlight">China</span>, South Africa, Bangladesh or French nuclear tests, or whether it be poverty, industrial relations, racism or rural depression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have sold more wheat without <span class="highlight">China</span>’s custom than we have ever sold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>God help us, we must keep him out of <span class="highlight">China</span> and out of Russia or he may mess that one up too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Sugar, steel, manufactured goods and equipment are all being sold to <span class="highlight">China</span> in increasing quantities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the same people tell us that even if we do not agree with Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> we should play ping-pong with people from that country, trade with them and have diplomatic relations with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same people who tell us that we should recognise Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> and admit it to the United Nations - it has been now - because it is the effective government of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, tell us in the same breath that we must cease to recognise Taiwan and expel it from the United Nations even though it is the effective government of Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Conversely we find that the new Prime Minister of Japan,  Mr Tanaka,  the leader of a conservative government, is now making a bold bid for close friendship ties with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But why does Australia not negotiate with <span class="highlight">China</span> for the purpose of opening up a similar trade centre in Peking for the purpose of cultivating trade relations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> is almost totally an untapped source. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only virtue in all this is that once again the nation has been reminded - the reminder is most timely coming as it does on the eve of an election - that if by any horrible quirk of fate the Leader of the Opposition should attain the Prime Ministership, we can expect to be governed with a degree of responsibility roughly equivalent to that of a maddened bull in a <span class="highlight">china</span> shop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In academic circles Professor Arndt of the Australian National University has resigned from the Labor Party organisation because of the behaviour of the Leader of the Opposition in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He did not resign because of the Leader of the Opposition’s trip to <span class="highlight">China</span> but ‘ because of his behaviour there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While debating the estimates for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, let me say that we have seen the same sort of political dishonesty in relation to wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One fact in relation to wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> is that in 1964 this Government deliberately stood oyer the Australian Wheat Board and directed that the Wheat Board pass a note to Chinese authorities, thus introducing politics into the wheat trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia lost the wheat trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> after Canada recognised <span class="highlight">China</span>, but we will regain it and we will regain it very quickly under a Labor government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When I came back from <span class="highlight">China</span> last year I stated quite categorically in this Parliament and outside the Parliament that I believed that the Colonial Sugar Refining Co.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am saying that when I made, that statement Cabinet Ministers ridiculed it, and now by strange coincidence trade in sugar is being developed with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

    <p>If Australian manufacturers are forced into the position of having a smaller share, of the Australian market and so finding themselves selling less they must manufacture less and there will be less employment of Australians, with a corresponding boost to the employment in overseas factories, with Australian money going to pay the wages of workers in Japan, Hong Kong, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Europe, America and the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the fall in our trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> from $168m 10 years ago to $37m in 1971-72, will he consider some new iniative with <span class="highlight">China</span> which will get his Government off the slow boat which is leaving us so far behind the rest of the world in <span class="highlight">China</span> trade and which is in fact leaving us somewhat lonely? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is an indication that we are having remarkable success in trading a variety of products with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, we have succeeded in making 2 sales of sugar to <span class="highlight">China</span> where we have never had sales before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the reported sale of United States wheat to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> mean that there is now full diplomatic recognition between these 2 countries, or does it simply highlight the absurdity of claims that wheat contracts flow only as a result of diplomatic recognition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding of the position between the United States and <span class="highlight">China</span> is that diplomatic relations have not been established in that neither as yet recognises the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But it is true that the visit of President Nixon to <span class="highlight">China</span> represents, as indeed does the visit of the Japanese Prime Minister to <span class="highlight">China</span>, a significant advance in the furthering of relations between the East and the West. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As to trade connections between <span class="highlight">China</span>, Australia and America I think the figures which my colleague the Minister for Trade and Industry gave to the House this day effectively demonstrates how Australia, working as it has consistently on a commercial basis, has been able, over a significant range of commodities, to increase its volume of trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> irrespective of diplomatic recognition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am told that the sale of wheat by the United States to <span class="highlight">China</span> was a result of a French vendor’s being unable to supply it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A statement has been put out by the  Chairman  of the Australian Wheat Board,  Mr Cass,  that a contract has been negotiated with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> for 1 million tons of wheat to be delivered during 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is evidence of growing goodwill and the improvement in our relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On Tuesday last I stated in this House that we had been having remarkable success in selling a wide range of commodities to <span class="highlight">China</span>, with the exception of wheat and zinc in relation to which sales had either gone down or we had not made sales in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To have made this sale now is a continuation of the excellent performance and the relations of the Wheat Board with <span class="highlight">China</span> during most of the decade of the 1 960s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But there is a real, keen desire to get into closer relationship with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exactly 5 weeks ago the honourable member for Dawson put out a lengthy statement to the effect that no sales would be made to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> while the Australian Government maintained a hostile attitude towards the Government of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the great sin in his statement is that he deliberately told the world that this Government had a hostile attitude towards the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member, on behalf of his Party, has deliberately tried to give to the world a distorted impression of this country’s attitude to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, and he did so knowing full well, or saying now that he knew, that a sale would be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be noted that under the contract with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> wheat will be delivered from January 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the 1960s, of course, Australia was amongst the first 5 major traders with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has consistently followed a policy of hostility to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as <span class="highlight">China</span> is concerned, trade, economics and politics are inseparable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We regard the political relationship between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span> as the fundamental question as regards further wheat sales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of Australia’s hostility to <span class="highlight">China</span> it follows that such an attitude cannot but affect our trade policy with the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, Australia is supporting Chiang Kai-shek and has established diplomatic relations with Taiwan; secondly, Australia has continuously opposed the restoration of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s legitimate seat in the United Nations; thirdly, Australia supports and follows United States aggression in South East Asia; fourthly Australia refuses to recognise the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> as the sole legal government representing all the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chinese people, including the people of the Province of Taiwan; and lastly, Australia is collaborating with the United States of America to create  2  Chinas, or one <span class="highlight">China</span> and one Taiwan and is, therefore, interfering in the internal affairs of  <span class="highlight">China</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On my return to Australia the first statement I made was that the door to trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> was open. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that in regard to wheat I was convinced that this was only a temporary loss for Australia and that as soon as political considerations became more normal Australia would share in imports of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We notice that never does the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  refer to <span class="highlight">China</span> now as ‘Red <span class="highlight">China</span>’ or ‘Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who will forget the occasion in 1966 when he ranted around Australia about the Red arrows coming down from <span class="highlight">China</span> to invade Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No, of course he does not, because the Prime Minister himself has admitted in writing that a note was sent by the Australian Government to the Wheat Board to be passed on to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To nail this once and for all, I refer to the first statement I made in the Parliament after J returned from <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As regards the restoration of the wheat trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>, the facts are that while in <span class="highlight">China</span> I did everything possible to persuade Chinese authorities to alter their wheat policy as it presently discriminates against the Australian unheal grower and to resume wheat purchases from the Australian Wheat Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I argued that if <span class="highlight">China</span> were prepared to trade with Australian private companies like Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd which comprised people or shareholders, <span class="highlight">China</span> should be prepared to trade also with Australian wheat farmers who are really shareholders of the Australian Wheat Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the day I left Peking I was informed that consideration would be given to my request to resume the wheat trade with Australia on the grounds that Australian wheat farmers, like the shareholders of an Australian private company, were not responsible for the Australian Government’s foreign policies and hostility to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, the Australian Labor Party -  made to <span class="highlight">China</span>’s trade policy makers on behalf of the Australian wheat farmers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the first statement I made in this Parliament after returning from <span class="highlight">China</span> on the restoration of the wheat trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All he has done during the course of the last 2 years has been to be a mischief maker as regards the relationship between the Australian Wheat Board and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If anything, he has made trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> more difficult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the unfortunate thing about the honourable member for Dawson making a personal explanation is that he has deliberately again tried to bring a political aspect to our trade relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> and has endeavoured to exacerbate our relations with that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is continuing to say that this country is hostile to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dr Patterson said the recent statement by Chou En-lai assuring Canada of long term wheat sales with <span class="highlight">China</span> is clear evidence that <span class="highlight">China</span> will not buy any wheat from Australia as long as the Australian Government continues its policy of hostility to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to build up better relationships with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not only a demonstration that we can sell any commodity to <span class="highlight">China</span>, but also that <span class="highlight">China</span> wants to improve its relations with us and we want to improve our relations with that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He knew after his trip to <span class="highlight">China</span> that he was wrong and one member of his Party has said publicly that he was wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had an example of this when the United States Government prohibited the Ford company’s subsidiary in Canada from producing trucks for export to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, even though there was considerable unemployment in Canada’s motor vehicle industry at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make a couple of observations on the monumental hypocrisy of this Government in its relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lack of formal recognition will not detract in the future, any more than it has in the past, from our perception of the important place of <span class="highlight">China</span> in the world and our respect for the individual people of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is our purpose and our intention to move rapidly towards a recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard recently that the Australian Government has not been and is not hostile to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do supporters of the Government not recall that Australia led in the United Nations every movement, every motion and every resolution that came up to have the admittance of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, to the United Nations regarded as an important question so that it could circumvent a simple majority decision of the United Nations and replace it by a twothirds vote? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now the Prime Minister has indicated that it is really the attitude of the countries around the area that will dictate what we do in our relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Japan has just recognised <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may take up another flirtation with the truth which was mentioned last night by the Prime Minister, he said that Indonesia has not recognised <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am surprised at the attitude of the Opposition which is bursting to get involved with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are getting along very well indeed with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why do we want to change this relationship, when probably recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span> would create other difficulties with closer neighbours and so on? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great nations such as the United States of America, Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span> are using trawling fleets to take out the fish resources from the Pacific Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> conflict - perhaps the most serious issue in international security since the end of the Second World War - the United Nations has played no role whatever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its double standards were also apparent when the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> was admitted to the United Nations because it was the effective government of the mainland, but Taiwan was expelled even though it was the effective government of Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The presence of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> on the Security Council has meant that the trend will be towards more vetoes, more verbal confrontation and even less agreement than there has been in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past year the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> has been admitted to membership, but the initial attitude of its delegates and its blocking of the admission of Bangladesh into the United Nations can scarcely be regarded as an auspicious beginning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to a gallup poll published in May/ June 1972 the Australian people are closely divided on the <span class="highlight">China</span> problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everybody is tremendously preocupied with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let us not forget for a moment that we should not be deluded into thinking that <span class="highlight">China</span> will become a great trading nation in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody who thinks that simply by recognising <span class="highlight">China</span> Australia will avail itself of vast trading opportunities just does not know the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, of course, the position of <span class="highlight">China</span> is one of the imponderables in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this context I mention the effect President Nixon’s visit had in helping to bring about to a much greater degree the emergence of <span class="highlight">China</span> into the concert of nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect on <span class="highlight">China</span> was not as strong as it was on Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen already the very quick movements which have taken place between Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could move gradually towards incorporation within <span class="highlight">China</span> or alternatively the Taiwanese - as opposed to the Chinese on Taiwan - could assert their independence and say that they have no particular wish 10 become absorbed within <span class="highlight">China</span> and in fact could work towards becoming an independent nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us take the situation in relation to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what is so secret about the situation in <span class="highlight">China</span>, Tibet, Peru or anywhere else? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I made was …that last night the Prime Minister categorically stated that Indonesia ‘did not recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indonesia does recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Primary Industry whether it is a fact that the Australian Wheat Board has recently sold 1 million tons of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now they are selling wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> and it is acclaimed as  a  tumultuous event. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#debate-9">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But the history of <span class="highlight">China</span> as far back as one would care to go is that <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#debate-9">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are the Vietnam Moratorium, anti-apartheid, abortion on demand, anti-State aid, the immediate recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the selling out of Taiwan, support of the National Liberation Front, which is even incorporated in the Labor Party’s policy, opposition to the New South Wales Summary Offences Act, and many others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My Government believes that our close relations with the United States, our growing partnership with Japan and the speedy and successful normalisation of relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> provide a realistic and fruitful basis for such an Australian initiative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730227_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He probably really wanted to go further and say the Government wanted Australia to be aligned with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To say that the Labor Party was in any way under a cloud because there was some talk of <span class="highlight">China</span> offering to withdraw a wheat deal just does not hold any water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government is setting up ambassadorial representation in Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, in North Vietnam and in East Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have never seen anything more servile or obsequious than the acceptance of the terms laid down by Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my understanding that Australia has accepted 23 of the 29 conditions which Peking said we had to accept if we wanted the friendship of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people in <span class="highlight">China</span> know all about this agreement which Australia has accepted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These militant trade union leaders obviously realise that in Hanoi, East Berlin and Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> there are not any strikes, there are no stop work meetings, there are no go slows, there is no discussion about more money or more benefits for the workers simply because in those countries big brother makes the decision and if anyone argues for better conditions in those countries they are shot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As someone remarked to me recently: ‘<span class="highlight">China</span> has its Chou En-lai; Queensland has its Lying’ Joh’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is time  Mr Whitlam  lost his preoccupation, indeed his obsession with <span class="highlight">China</span> and became preoccupied with Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And while the Government has been gaily rushing into recognition of Red <span class="highlight">China</span> - upon what terms we do not know, except that we know that <span class="highlight">China</span> got everything that it asked for - welcoming North Vietnamese trade unionists, lifting the ban on travel to North Vietnam and establishing diplomatic relations with East Germany and North Vietnam - it has done everything possible to undermine our assistance to our allies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same applies to Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span>, both of whom operate a police state and both of whom in recent times have been responsible for committing mass murder amongst their own citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But it is time  Mr Whitlam  lost his preoccupation - or is it obsession - with <span class="highlight">China</span> and became preoccupied with Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was they who were then embarrassed when a contract arrived to supply wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> and the ground had not been tilled and the seed had not been sown, lt was not possible to fulfil that contract from Australian wheat stocks and it looked as though stocks would have to be bought from overseas to fulfil it That is a disgraceful situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first thing which occurred was the rushing, with inde-cent haste, into the arms of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is notable that in the case of most of the diplomatic relations that have been established with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> the negotiations have been slow and carefully considered and have dragged out over some considerable time; a very close bargaining process has accompanied them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The details are said to be available in <span class="highlight">China</span>, but the only real guidance one can get is from broadcasts from Peking and from people who are Chinese experts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To determine whether Australia can fulfil its commitments to our allies, to follow up and support our fundamental security interests, one has to look, in these circumstances, to the machinations of the Labor Party Conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of these things do arouse considerable misgivings amongst a good many of us, particularly in view of the Peoples Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> negotiations with the recognition immediately of Eastern Germany and even more so just recently with that of North Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But is it really in Australia’s interests, for example, for the Prime Minister to dump the 18 million people of Taiwan in his headlong rush to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why has there not been a single word of protest against <span class="highlight">China</span>’s nuclear testing programme from the Prime Minister and others who are so critical, and rightly critical, of the French tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that this House and the Australian people need an explanation as to what the Prime Minister did in trying to get this man out of <span class="highlight">China</span> when he knew, as Leader of the Opposition, that  Mr James  was in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Overseas Trade and Minister for Secondary Industry  (Dr J. F.

    <p>The Whitlam plan for reshaping Asia with a new pact to include <span class="highlight">China</span> and Japan, but excluding the United States and the Soviet Union, lost its last possible South East Asian supporter when Malaysia weighed in against the proposal last weekend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 15 million people on Taiwan do as much trade each year as their 800 million counterparts in Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, and while this trade continues Taiwan will remain very much a going concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that great play has been made of the supposed loss of our wheat trade to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, but Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> has always bought wheat when she has needed it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Six or 7 years ago Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> purchased SI 00m worth of wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> has always purchased our wheat when she has required it, irrespective of the influence of Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note, too, that the communist controlled countries Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia have great, difficulty in getting their government farmers to grow grain and hand it over to the government because farmers,, being what they are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Patterson spoke also about mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rather interesting to recall that as soon as <span class="highlight">China</span> was recognised by Australia  Mr Murray  Byrne, a Liberal Minister of the Victorian Parliament, went off to <span class="highlight">China</span> to try to promote trade and tourism between the Liberal controlled State of Victoria and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already mentioned that one Liberal State Minister has taken the opportunity to scarper to <span class="highlight">China</span> to see that his State gets its slice of the cake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that, in the speeches that were made in this House on foreign affairs - at least after 1964 and 1965  -  there was a thread of appeal for the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to be recognised as something other than that country which had attacked, for example, Tibet and been guilty of genocide some 20- odd years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the present Australian Prime Minister made overtures to go to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> cannot be denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When arrangements were made for the  President  of the United States to visit the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, it looked as though the then Leader of the Opposition in Canberra had been looking into a crystal ball and making assessments which would prove remarkable in their future application. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What was the real reason for the American decision to seek a closer relationship with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is interesting to wonder whether, if the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> had not proceeded to establish its own nuclear capacity and if, for example, from the period of Premier Khrushchev  onwards  there had not been a deterioration in relations between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, the present situation would have existed at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The countries in our region which are most vitally concerned with the relations between the People’s Republic  of  <span class="highlight">China</span> and the USSR are, of course, Japan and, unquestionably, Taiwan and India and Pakistan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia, being so far away, has watched the deterioration in relations between the USSR and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and wondered whether this deterioration was an indication that nuclear war would take place in due course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be observed and must be admitted that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is moving towards normal relations with more countries at a greater rate than would have been deemed possible 10 or even 5 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is vital for us to remember that, at present, relations between the USSR and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> remain very sensitive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Japanese, of course, who would be vitally concerned in any war between the USSR and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, have done all that they can to normalise their relations with the Government in Peking in order to establish, if possible, a measure of influence and understanding with that Government in the hope that peace will be maintained in our region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This leaves Taiwan - the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> - to be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ever ready to denounce the denial of human rights in Russia, <span class="highlight">China</span>, North Vietnam and other communist countries, the former Government was noticeably reluctant to apply the same yardstick to South Africa, Rhodesia, Greece, Spain, Portugal and the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Votes for 18-year-olds, the abolition of national service, recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, and more control of and information about United States bases in Australia are all measures that daily add to the program introduced by the new Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Indonesians were not willing to see the influence of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> extending so rapidly into our region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst recognising the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, let us make sure the people of Taiwan are not sacrificed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before I pass from this subject of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, what did the Victorian Minister for Tourism,  Mr Byrne,  say according to today’s Press? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He had much praise for the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On his return a day or two ago from a visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> he shouted high praise and said that <span class="highlight">China</span> is going to regard Australia, from the point of view of imports, as one of its most favoured nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague the honourable member for Paterson  (Mr O’Keefe),  whose electorate adjoins mine, was not critical of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in his remarks in this debate, but praised Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> had always bought our wheat when that country needed it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then overnight <span class="highlight">China</span> became respectable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why did <span class="highlight">China</span> become respectable? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The true reasons why <span class="highlight">China</span> has become respectable in the eyes of the United States have never been stated in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> became respectable with the United States because the American Chamber of Manufactures put the pressure on and said to the Nixon Administration that it wanted to sell some surplus goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> was contemplating the purchase of some modern transport aircraft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> was contemplating buying some British aircraft and had placed orders for, I think, a couple of Concordes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pressure was applied to the Nixon Administration to get on to the bandwagon and get over to <span class="highlight">China</span> to try to sell some aircraft, thus relieving the redundancy in the Boeing aircraft factory in the Seattle region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was one of the reasons why <span class="highlight">China</span> became respectable overnight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is one thing that I think we on this side can say and that is that certainly when the previous Government was in office it did not follow the United States so slavishly and without question as this Government has followed communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, the communist section in Vietnam and apparently other communist and left wing orientated countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a subservience to communist <span class="highlight">China</span> by this present Government far beyond anything which the previous Government might have done in relation to the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been stated in the Press on a number of occasions - I have copies of the statements - and it has never been denied by the Government that, at a send off party given in Sydney for the Australian Ambassador to the Peoples Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>,  Dr Fitzgerald,  at which about 550 guests were present, including some members of the Ministry, when the toast to  Her  Majesty the Queen was proposed, many remained seated or acted perfunctorily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ALP must be forced to take a clear position in support of the following demands: The complete withdrawal of all Australian military forces and material support of any kind from Indo <span class="highlight">China</span>; and an end to any form of complicity and political support for US policies there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the unions under communism or left-wing control today, and contemplates the potential pincer movement constituted by the Russian progress across the Indian Ocean and the now apparently inevitable communisation of Indo <span class="highlight">China</span>, one hopes we shall not too brashly thumb our noses at old friends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not want to find that our only friends are Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> and East Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australian Ambassador to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since this Government took office we have experienced the most indecent rush to recognise the 3 communist countries of <span class="highlight">China</span>, East Germany and North Vietnam, with communist North Korea soon to be added to the happy throng. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But a more astute statesman would have found a more astute formula for the recognition of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be desirable, and I believe it is, that we should establish diplomatic relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as soon as the Government got into office, it was in a tremendous hurry and flurry to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know also that it was intended to send some merino rams to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> until some outside force said that this must not be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> has already occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opposition side whenever one refers to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet I find it fascinating and indeed interesting that the first official visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> from Australia should in fact be by a Liberal Minister in the Victorian State Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decisions have been made in relation to Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> and the East German Republic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But quick as a flash we embraced <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did so when tests were carried out by Britain, by the United States and by the Soviet Union, and it continues to do so now that it is carried out by <span class="highlight">China</span> and France alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We deplore the fact that <span class="highlight">China</span> and France have not joined the treaty banning nuclear tests in the atmosphere to which America, the Soviet and Britain long since subscribed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must take a second look now at the European Common Market and also, of course, we must look very carefully at <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>France and <span class="highlight">China</span> are the only 2 countries currently testing nuclear weapons in the atmosphere and thus contributing to nuclear fallout. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I say that I definitely include the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are a signatory whilst neither France nor <span class="highlight">China</span> has signed this treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are now only 2 countries testing nuclear devices in the atmosphere - <span class="highlight">China</span> and France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that the new Government has established diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, similar channels for specific protests are open to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not a possibility because both France and <span class="highlight">China</span> would veto any Security Council action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we cut off diplomatic relations we will be in the same position as we were with <span class="highlight">China</span> and will be able to make only general appeals to the United Nations without direct communication with the French Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I come to the question of the recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let me point out that the United States which has made an accommodation with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> - that is, Peking - has retained an accommodation with Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tt has de facto relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> but each has liaison officers with full relations with Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Canada simply found a formula of noting the position of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in Taiwan and retained a neutral position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, after looking inwards for so long, was looking outwards to an increasing degree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> finally was admitted as a member of the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, when the right honourable member for Lowe  (Mr McMahon)  was Minister for Foreign Affairs he initiated a major study of the relationship of Australia with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What will happen if the Senate decides by resolution that it considers the question of our relations with the United States of America or perhaps the details of the recognition of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> are more important international matters that this Committee should consider? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look back very briefly, particularly in relation to this foreign affairs discussion, at Australia’s recognition of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addressing my question to the Prime Minister I refer him to the Press conference he gave on Tuesday, 13th March last, during which, in answer to a question, he said: ‘Australia is not discernibly affected by nuclear tests by <span class="highlight">China</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a jurisdictional element which applies to France and does not apply to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, Australia can, we believe, take action in the International Court of Justice against France because of her atmospheric tests, action which is not available to Australia to take against <span class="highlight">China</span> in the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister and the AttorneyGeneral have blundered into this mess like bulls in a <span class="highlight">china</span> shop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He reverently lifted one down, stood it in a <span class="highlight">china</span> wash basin and advised us to stand clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>United States in particular to building up trading relationships with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>  17,000,  Indonesia  12,000,  Japan  12,000,  Lebanon  33,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> has not accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not open for Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span> to take- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>France and Australia both have accepted, on conditions which they have set out, the jurisdiction of the Court; the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> has not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, as I was going on to say, while France and Australia can, in the circumstances which apply in their documents of accession, take proceedings against each other before the Court it is not possible for Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span> to take such proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that France and <span class="highlight">China</span>, the other remaining nuclear powers, should both accede to the treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I made that plain when I was Leader of the Opposition, in conversations with the Prime Minister of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in July 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are concerned only about machinating around the world and increasing their profits from one country to another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It wants rapport with <span class="highlight">China</span> or Russia to get high grade coking coal and crude oil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, what the Australian Government is seeking to achieve in its relations not only with Britain but also with a number of other countries -  the United States, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Canada, and our Asian neighbours, for instance - is to give formal recognition to what has already happened, as the necessary foundation for a realistic, more independent, more mature foreign policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I found a close identity of views between our 2 Governments on all matters which we discussed, for example, the recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span> and North Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many honourable members would have liked to have said something about the Government’s nuclear adventures with France and the lack of its nuclear adventures with Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is so, why are we not threatening to do to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> what the Government is threatening to do to France, namely, to break off diplomatic relations unless it comes to the party? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is so, why should we be sensitive against Prance, our ally, and not sensitive against Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> which, diplomatic ties or not, proclaims itself to be our enemy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In talking about the attitude of the Government to the French nuclear tests the honourable member criticised its approach to tests carried out by <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also wish to inform the House that the Minister for Overseas Trade and Minister for Secondary Industry,  Dr J.  F. Cairns, leaves Australia today to lead a trade mission to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the objective of the Australian Government to increase trade between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span>, both ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year Australia’s exports to <span class="highlight">China</span> totalled about $37m and imports about $41m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that there are representatives of textile industries and other major industries in this delegation who will be going to <span class="highlight">China</span> to explore the possibilities of trade between that country and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure the honourable member that the matter will continue to be kept under active consideration and that any major contracts or major trading arrangements between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Australia involving textiles or for that matter any product which will endanger employment of the work force in general in Australia or have an effect on our trade will be kept under close scrutiny and policy action will be taken accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he now give me an assuurance that neither he nor any member of his staff unofficially gave the media information that  Dr S.  Fitzgerald was to be appointed by him as Australia’s Ambassador to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, when he officially stated he could not announce the name of the Ambassador until the Chinese Government had agreed; if not, why not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am reminded also that with all his great outcry he still sat silently by while the Australian Country Party sold its wheat to Red <span class="highlight">China</span> - as it was called at that time - and he did not utter a word of protest about that at any stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Labor Government received representations from the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> about this application? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this demonstrate that the present policy of the Labor Government with respect to domestic matters is to be determined by representations by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that an Australian delegation has gone to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> perhaps we could ask the members of that delegation to look at what happened in Tibet where religious persecution was accompanied by wholesale genocide, where the Dalai Lama, the religious leader of the country, is in exile and where that country is still being closed by its Chinese overlords to any visit by observers from democratic nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the fine sentiments expressed by the honourable member in regard to an African country will find more coherent and cogent expression in regard to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that an Australian delegation is to visit that country, surely we can ask members of the delegation - 1 am sure that the honourable member for Hunter will be writing to his friends in that delegation; the air mail is available to him - to make inquiries about religious persecution in Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> and particularly religious persecution of the Tibetan people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian delegation to <span class="highlight">China</span> will be led by the trusted friend of everybody in this House - the Minister for Overseas Trade and Minister for Secondary Industry  (Dr J. F. Cairns). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How much is paid to the people who are making the articles which we are to import from Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we have an economic delegation going to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, surely the most important thing that it should bring back to us is the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Government now to send instructions to the economic delegation that we now have in Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> to find out what the wage levels are and to bring back a factual report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that in the past it has been difficult to find out what has been going on in Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, which does not have quite an open Government, if I may use that phrase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>House may correct me - that 2 members of the Opposition parties will be going to <span class="highlight">China</span> shortly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us explore this implication a little more because the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  started this argument tonight in relation to clothing and other Australian produced goods when he referred to the cost level of some countries - in this case, <span class="highlight">China</span> - which could be competitors of Australian companies or the work force, depending on what happens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think it is fair to say - I disagree, perhaps, a little with the honourable member for Mackellar on this point - that the price level set by countries such as <span class="highlight">China</span>, nine times out of ten, bears no relation to costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>’s industry cannot be compared with those vital emerging economies based on entrepreneural tactics and free enterprise of Hong Kong, Singapore and, indeed, Taiwan, where the wage levels and conditions are advancing at a very good pace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Prime Minister inform the House whether he realises that the way in which he has advanced his proposal for a wide regional association of Asian nations, including the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, with his specific statement that he would in this matter consult with Indonesia and Japan, has caused some offence in India? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When, as a result of your question, his status as a Minister of the Government of Taiwan was brought to notice, the Department of Foreign Affairs received representations from the Charge d’Affairs of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think perhaps the best thing we can do is to point out that all of the countries in the Asian area that were, previously underdeveloped and have really achieved industrialisation and near full employment are those countries - I am thinking particularly of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and of japan - which have financed all their development as far as possible without importing foreign capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The suggestion that what goes on in the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> could be followed in Papua New Guinea leaves one wondering where the basic philosophy on the other side of the House is coming from these days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in countries such as Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, there are industries which technologically are just as efficient as any industry in Australia or the United States of America, perhaps not overall, but in the smaller areas where these industries - for example, the textile industry - apply principles which they have imported from overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the moment, for example, we have a delegation in Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> looking at its industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am sure that he is sincere in what he has told us about Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, although I must remind the honourable gentleman that he is 3 years out of date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of the House, the threat to the Australian textile industry does not come from the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of his reply yesterday contradicting his earlier answer on the granting of a visa to  Mr K.  T.

    <p>Further, will the Prime Minister explain why he allows the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to dictate to Australia in matters of this kind? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The right honourable member for Lowe  (Mr McMahon)  said that during question time I had speculated as to what would have happened if a Minister of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> had sought to visit Australia while he was the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman went further - it did not seem to relate to his personal explanation - and said that if one of his Ministers had received an invitation from the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> it would have been considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently it was only through subsequent representations received from the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> that that view was changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Prime Minister alleged that through actions of the preceding Government the Australian Wheat Board lost sales to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position was that in September 1972, while the previous Government was in office, a contract for 37 million bushels of wheat was negotiated with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>’, he said: ‘The protest to <span class="highlight">China</span> was oral, so there would be no written response’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we look not only to rural finance and the wool reserve price plan to find this dichotomy of opinion between the Liberal and the Country Parties in the previous Government; also, the Country Party wanted to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>, while the Liberal Party did not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The previous Government by its action in refusing to recognise Red <span class="highlight">China</span> in a political way denied us the opportunity of selling additional wheal to <span class="highlight">China</span> and this, of course, is to its everlasting discredit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a fact that a substantial quantity of sugar  -  50,000 tons - has just been sold to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> is not a member of the Agreement and all aspects of the sale were conducted within the provisions which apply to the sale of sugar to countries which are not members of the Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sale is excellent news as far as Australia is concerned because following on the successful achievements of the trade mission which is at present in <span class="highlight">China</span> with respect to wheat and wool it is now clear that this very large sale of sugar heralds the expansion of good trading relations between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accepting, as members on this side of the House do, the necessity for all reasonable steps to be taken to try to prevent future nuclear explosions in the atmosphere, whether by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> or by France, what purpose does the Minister believe will be served by the dispatch of HMAS ‘Sydney’ or any other Australian naval vessel to Mururoa Atoll or thereabouts, apparently in order to intrude on the nuclear explosion area? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was one man whose position gave him unique power to achieve these changes and I here gratefully acknowledge the pivotal role played by  President  Nixon in ushering in a new and saner phase in our relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>; in clearing the way for more intensive commercial, scientific, technical and cultural exchanges between the United States of America and the Soviet Union, and thereby achieving a successful first round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and ending foreign intervention in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As soon as we took office, we initiated the process towards recognising the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> - in essence, towards removing our <span class="highlight">China</span> Embassy from Taipei to Peking, the capital of <span class="highlight">China</span> of which Taiwan is a province. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In March this year we welcomed to Australia the Minister for Foreign Trade of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,  Mr Patolichev,  and a high-level Australian trade delegation led by the Minister for Overseas Trade  (Dr J.

    <p>Is the Minister not aware ‘of the fact that in the past 10 years Australia sold over , $k000m worth of wheat and over S200m worth, of other produce to <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable member had been present in this House during the various debates when Australia was placed at the bottom of the list as regards wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> and when it was made quite clear following the Canadian recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span> that we would continue to be placed at that level, he would realise the truth of the content of what I se id and that it was the action and the disastrous foreign policies of the previous Government that caused the Chinese Government to take this action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were informed that In the event of Cuba not being able to supply the needs of <span class="highlight">China</span>, Australia would be given a high priority in relation to selling sugar to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As we know there are only 2 countries at present which test nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, and they are France and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, he put to us the extraordinary position that because <span class="highlight">China</span> was in the northern hemisphere and the winds went one way in the northern hemisphere and the other way in the southern hemisphere the Chinese testing did not have any influence on Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fallout goes right across <span class="highlight">China</span> - its own country - and then goes immediately across Japan and finally on to the North American continent and around on to Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can he provide details of (a) the nuclear weapons tests carried out by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> during the last 5 years, (b) the dates on which these tests took place, (c) the location of these tests and (d) the explosive power of each device tested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-41-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There appear to have been six test explosions carried out by <span class="highlight">China</span> in the last five years, the most recent one being on 18 March 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-41-9">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he aware that the report stated that, in answer to a question directed to him about whether he had received any response from the Chinese Government to his protest note on the nuclear tests, he said that the protest to <span class="highlight">China</span> was oral so there would be no written response? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>program  Dr Fitzgerald,  Australia’s Ambassador to <span class="highlight">China</span>, stated that his predecessor,  Mr Cotterill,  lodged a protest note with the Chinese Assistant Minister? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not necessary for him to read the report of the conference in the daily Press to know that he had stated unequivocally that the protest to <span class="highlight">China</span> was oral and that for that reason he did not expect a written response. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The transcript states quite clearly that the protest to <span class="highlight">China</span> was oral so that there would be no written response. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs he should have been aware that the Ambassador to <span class="highlight">China</span> whom he appointed had stated in a radio interview that a protest note had been lodged with the Chinese Assistant Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: Will he now cease acting like a bull in a <span class="highlight">china</span> shop and follow longestablished protocol in accord with proper diplomatic approaches in this matter in order to avoid unnecessary embarrassment to Australia and the United States of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister’s lack of interest in and opposition to the aggressive actions taken by the communists in IndoChina must surely support the view that his Government is dominated largely by pressures from communist sources inside and outside this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, on assuming office in the first week the duumvirate Whitlam-Barnard dictatorship moved to recognise communist <span class="highlight">China</span> and to dump Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One such occasion was in his reference to the recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister gave less than due credit to the progress which the previous Government had initiated and advanced towards normalisation of relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> and the extent to which the previous Government had factually recognised <span class="highlight">China</span> in its dealings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But Australia and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> both had embassies in capitals such as Paris, Cairo and Belgrade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> subsequently supported us in our election to the Security Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that had the Liberal-Country Party been returned to government we would have recognised the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in a relatively short time - perhaps within a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has said in this House that the formula he secured with <span class="highlight">China</span> was the same as the Canadian formula. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Canada simply noted <span class="highlight">China</span>’s position regarding Taiwan; Australia was required to acknowledge it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any increase in our trade with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> will, in turn, have to be substantial if it is even to make good the ground which has been lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, I believe that most Australians consider that the formal recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> was right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A true example of resources diplomacy would rather be the action of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in assigning political reasons for its refusal to purchase wheat from Australia during 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was done to bring political pressure on Australia at a time when <span class="highlight">China</span> was seeking admission to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The association was to include the Peoples Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In mentioning that he would consult with Indonesia and Japan he failed to take account of India’s views regarding its role in Asia, or, indeed, of the fact that it is not so long since India was defending itself against troops of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We supported a resolution in the United Nations General Assembly to admit the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> though, as is known, we opposed the simultaneous expulsion of our friend Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are many factors which made the United States of America, the Soviet Union, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Japan, Europe and India the major actors on the world stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We sought, when in government, to normalise Australia’s relationship with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There were differences on both sides, determined in large part by the events of the tumultuous post-war years when the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> was established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the contrary, what we have done is solidly based on a clear appreciation of the gradual but nevertheless real shift in international affairs which has been going on for years and which can be summed up as a change from the bipolar world which characterised the years of the Cold War to the multipolar world which emerged from such events as the split between the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span>, the integration of Europe through the European Common Market, the emergence of Japan as a major power and the Nixon Doctrine of greater self reliance in defence preparedness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was we who took the initiative in opposing our participation in the Vietnam conflict, in calling for more foreign aid, in proposing an end to racism in our international dealings, in co-operating with the movement of self government and independence for Papua New Guinea and in opening up normal relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In both instances a number of Australian missions were instructed to inform in advance the governments to which they were accredited that Australia intended to open negotiations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for mutual recognition and the establishment of diplomatic relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-60-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I conclude my remarks by asking why on earth did the Prime Minister not get some technical information from the experts before he rushed into this like a bull into a <span class="highlight">china</span> shop? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even though we are now out of Vietnam, even though the Republican  President  of the United States has forged a new detente with <span class="highlight">China</span> and with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and even though there is not a country within 1,000 miles of Australia that appears to be remotely aggressive or expansionist - unless of course one thinks that New Zealand, since it went socialist, is a threat to Australia - clearly the Liberals would have spent some hundreds of millions of dollars more on defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I see that the Minister is to be one of the 3 Ministers, including the Prime Minister, going to Japan and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> for discussions in October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer particularly to the wheat trade with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade now taking place in Tokyo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It secured markets for Australian wheat in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because this Government has a contract with <span class="highlight">China</span> which members opposite could not secure they do not want to give the Government credit for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Also, after my visit to Japan where I am to represent the Government as Minister for Foreign Affairs as well as Prime Minister, and my visit to <span class="highlight">China</span>,  Senator Willesee,  who is himself now abroad representing Australia at the United Nations General Assembly and other international meetings, will be sworn as Minister for Foreign Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Washington on 30 July I said, the fact is that Australia would benefit from some arrangement whereby nations of the Western Pacific could regularly consult and, obviously <span class="highlight">China</span> is one of those countries’ … ‘so one would hope that it would be possible in the Western Pacific, irrespective of ideologies, to have some arrangements where countries like Australia and Japan are able to consult regularly without motive, without imputations, on the matters which concern them as neighbours.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-27-14">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question, Which I direct to the Minister for Overseas Trade, is in connection with the sale of Australian wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister say whether in recent times <span class="highlight">China</span> has placed a substantial long term order for Australian wheat with the Australian Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is precisely what the Minister for Foreign Trade for the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> told me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also told me, in the presence of the Prime Minister, that the statements made by the Leader of the Opposition on returning from <span class="highlight">China</span> were a distortion of what he had been told in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, I am very pleased to be able to announce, as I did at the end of last week, that we have reached agreement to sign a 3- year agreement for the sale of Australian wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the recent agreement for the sale of wheat to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> negotiated by the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having obtained this, it was then possible for the Wheat Board to go to <span class="highlight">China</span> and conduct the detailed negotiations necessary to put that agreement into effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government recognises <span class="highlight">China</span> on the best possible terms for Australia, lt reserved other vital national interests that Australia has in <span class="highlight">China</span> and Taiwan, including trade with both. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave - As honourable mem bers will be aware, I have recently returned from a series of trade discussions in Japan, in the Republic of Korea, in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and in the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Third, although developed countries like Japan and large countries like <span class="highlight">China</span> will be very important in the future, Australia must not be concerned with them alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was necessary, in order to travel to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, to pass through <span class="highlight">China</span> where I was able to renew contacts, particularly with the Chinese Minister for Foreign Trade, Minister Poi Hsiang-kuo, and with the Foreign Minister, Chi Peng Fei. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is particularly pleasing to me .to see the way that trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> has developed this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All Australian officials and others in <span class="highlight">China</span> have witnessed in recent weeks and months the increasing willingness of the Chinese to assist Australians in everything they are trying to do and the extremely friendly relations that they exhibit towards Australians at every level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will be the first time that Australia has negotiated such an agreement with <span class="highlight">China</span> and it is an historic step in the development of trade relations between our 2 countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>, when I was in Hong Kong I was discussing this with some individuals there, who were asking me what the prospects were like for investing money in land in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is widespread suspicion of the communist powers, both Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span>, and deep concern at the prospect of withdrawal of United States influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt in their minds - and I spoke to the same persons to whom the Minister has spoken in those countries - based on previous and current experience that Russia will move into any vacuum created by a Western withdrawal, and that if this happened <span class="highlight">China</span> would be bound to follow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In big power terms and stating the position baldly, I expect the next few years to be marked by a fairly stable equilibrium between the 3 major nuclear powers - the United States of America, the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have had figures taken out and these show that no country in Asia, including <span class="highlight">China</span>, today has a capability to invade our continent, nor is any of these countries likely to have the capacity to do so in under 5 to 10 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The latest Middle East crisis between Israel and the Arab States has produced an even more important crisis between the United States and the Soviet Union, and between the United States and the Communist Government of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was also big news when Nixon and Premier Chou En-Lai of <span class="highlight">China</span> signed the Shanghai declaration of February 27 1972, declaring that ‘both wish to reduce the danger of international conflict  . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Though President Nixon appealed to Chairman Brezhnev to co-operate in getting a cease-fire along the Suez, and Secretary of State Kissinger urged Huang Hua of <span class="highlight">China</span> here to co-operate in a big-power effort to stop the fighting, the plain fact is that Washington got no co-operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposed new bureaucracy with power to follow its own initiatives, power to restrict the authority of Cabinet and to restrict the opportunity for quick action to be .taken by the Government, really resembles the central planning authority which is a feature of the socialist systems in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and some other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not mention that  Mr Anthony,  the Leader of the Country Party, jeopardised Australia’s wheat contracts with <span class="highlight">China</span> and lost them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not recognise that our Minister for Overseas Trade  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  has just negotiated $600m worth of wheat contracts with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On Thursday night next I am to go to Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span> as Prime Minister and as Foreign Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But on 1 October he appeared on the television program ‘Monday Conference’, when he described the Government’s recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span> as common sense, and later as eminently sensible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He comes into this House with great aplomb because he has negotiated a long term agreement for the sale of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps he does not realise that the honourable member for Moore  (Mr Maisey),  in an earlier capacity, was one of those who pioneered the first contract for the sale of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Overseas Trade is apparently now giving some credit to the Australian Wheat Board for negotiating the sale of 170 million bushels of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>, but he claims the principal credit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps he does not realise that the 170 million bushels which he has negotiated to sell to <span class="highlight">China</span> over the next 3 years represents less than 60 million bushels a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister realise that the previous Government, in association with the Wheat Board, last year sold 40 million bushels to <span class="highlight">China</span> and that the Wheat Board said it could have sold twice as much if it had had the wheat to sell? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he realise that Australia has sold up to 82 million bushels of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> in previous years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note with great interest his journeys in Japan, Korea and <span class="highlight">China</span> and the discussions that he has had with the leaders of those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his statement the Minister made a triumphant reference to the 3-year wheat agreement with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I need hardly say that wheat sales to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> from Australia did not begin on 2 ‘December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has only to go back over our trade figures to find that there have been many sales of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Great play has been made on the statement with regard to our trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at the figures for 1972-73 I find that we have exported to <span class="highlight">China</span> goods to the value of $62,849,000 and that we have purchased in return from them goods to the value of $49,924,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said before, with the cutting of our tariffs cheaper textiles and goods will come in from <span class="highlight">China</span> and textile industries in this country will be under threat unless the Government imposes quantitative restrictions or takes some action in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Little Taiwan which the present Government booted out of this country when it took over purchased more goods from us than mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It outlines our trade relations with Japan, South and North Korea and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agreement to sell wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> is the best ever negotiated by an Australian <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have referred to some of those areas in which I have been trenchantly critical of the Government, and the one for which he takes more credit than anything else - <span class="highlight">China</span> - I would like to refer to very briefly now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, as he said, I accept the fact of recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, and my Leader has said it and properly so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we have been critical of the method whereby this Government recognised the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has recognised 2 Vietnams, 2 Koreas, 2 Germanys and one <span class="highlight">China</span> and has given no explanation for doing so other than it had to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enough said about the aspect of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But with this tremendous movement which nearly took over Indonesia, the Indonesian authorities are very sensitive to relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and with the rest of the communist world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They see, as other people see, that the current changes in <span class="highlight">China</span> have brought about a much more civilised type of government, if we may call it that, which is anxious to converse and have relations on a broadening basis with the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cries of outrage amounting sometimes to hysteria echoed down the corridors of the conservative Party when early in its term of office the new Government recognised the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> as the only valid government of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who apart from those in the other place, who seem to spend their time looking up the <span class="highlight">China</span> references in the Hansard reports of the early 1950s, would fail to appreciate the more flexible and co-operative patterns of relationship which for so long have been advocated by Labor which, alongside other major powers including the United States of America, has accepted <span class="highlight">China</span>’s role in world affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fruit of this Government’s total reversal of previous policy on <span class="highlight">China</span> is seen not only because we have adopted a new stance based upon mutual trust, friendship, and, wherever possible, co-operation similar to that which we enjoy with other major powers, but also because of the practical benefits resulting from increased trade, particularly in the areas of sugar and wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Overseas Trade  (Dr J. F. Cairns),  for so long a thorn in the flesh of the anti-<span class="highlight">China</span> clique but himself a prophetic and hopeful interpreter of political realities, was able to move confidently following the decisions of this Government in respect of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to establish, despite a heavy load of responsibility, a special rapport with both <span class="highlight">China</span>’s trade representatives and also with the leaders of industry here in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The accepted version of this is that the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics alone no longer dictate the pattern of events, and that <span class="highlight">China</span>, the European Economic Community and Japan are now significant in the ordering of world affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not sure that Japan yet fits into the league of America, Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> also will have to rely on skilful diplomacy rather than an exchange of material assets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> can be expected to try to drive wedges between East Europe and the USSR for world communist leadership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But <span class="highlight">China</span> will never be a large enough market or source of products to exceed most other regional groupings which will arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia pose the only serious military threat to world stability at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to take this opportunity to make a constructive suggestion to the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  who, I understand, is to go abroad shortly to represent Australia in various countries and particularly in Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As he says that he is a friend of all oppressed people, I suggest to him that he ask his good and trusted friend, the  Chairman  of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, to arrange for a deputation from this Parliament to visit Tibet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister considers the  Chairman  of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> his friend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this friendship is really as deep as the Prime Minister has suggested and if the distinguished  chairman  of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> has nothing to hide, it will be a simple matter for the Prime Minister to ask him whether he would allow a deputation of members from this Houst to visit Tibet and, with the proper facilities for seeing affairs there, to observe for themselves what the conditions are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it be true, as some people in <span class="highlight">China</span> say, that the stories relating to Tibet are utterly unfounded, it would be good for everybody, including the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, for the truth to be reported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is nothing to hide, I would think that the  Chairman  of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> would welcome a visit from members of this House who would be able to assure themselves and the world that all is sweetness and light in Tibet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that when he visits the distinguished  Chairman  of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> he will ask permission from him for a delegation from this House to visit Tibet so that the members of that delegation can see for themselves what is happening there and can make a report to the people of Australia and to the people of the world, because the people of the world surely should be interested in what is happening to a few million people on the roof of Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it is true that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  has friendly relations with the Premier of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad that he has, because somebody has to do something about overcoming the damage of the past and endeavour to get some good relations and some understanding between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What about the enormous amount of money that is spent on maintaining the Great Wall of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present moment nuclear arms are held by the United States, by Soviet Russia, in a small way by the United Kingdom and France, certainly by <span class="highlight">China</span> and probably by other countries as well but those other countries have not yet revealed in full what they possess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the dispute between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The SinoSoviet dispute was forcibly brought to my notice during a visit I made to <span class="highlight">China</span> in June of this year as part of a delegation from this Parliament which was led by the PostmasterGeneral  (Mr Lionel Bowen). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During our visit to <span class="highlight">China</span>, the delegation had discussions with representatives of the Chinese Government, including one meeting with the Chinese VicePremier,  Mr Li  Hsien-nien. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason I believe that the Australian Government will continue to oppose nuclear testing, whether it is by <span class="highlight">China</span>, by France or by any other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The overwhelming impression given to our parliamentary delegation in <span class="highlight">China</span>, as far as the foreign policy of the Chinese is concerned, was that their great fear is of the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They say that unequal treaties were imposed on <span class="highlight">China</span> in the nineteenth century - that is, treaties between czarist Russia and imperialist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My first practical suggestion, therefore, is that the SALT talks which are at present bipartite should be tri-partite ‘and should include <span class="highlight">China</span>, so that all decisions taken will have regard to the fact that the interests of more than 2 great powers are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it too much to ask that the United States could, in view of its improving relations with both <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia, act as an honest broker in the Sino-Soviet dispute? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The detente between the United States and <span class="highlight">China</span> indicates a similar situation there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was interested in the remarks of the honourable member for Kingston  (Dr Gun),  who travelled as I did, to <span class="highlight">China</span> during the recess as a member of the first parliamentary delegation from Australia to visit that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was very interested in all that was shown to the parliamentary delegation when we travelled to <span class="highlight">China</span> and in the attitude exhibited by the Australian Government towards the Chinese Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been almost nauseated at times by the lap dog subservience shown by some of the present Government Ministers towards everything that happens in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact on a number of occasions during our visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> we were pulled up quickly when some of the compliments became a little flowery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This applies also to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was most interested to see the real accomplishments and achievements which the British have managed to bring about, particularly in trade, in their relationships with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is ridiculous for people like  Dr Cairns  to say that <span class="highlight">China</span> will become the third leg of our world trading stool, America and Japan being the other 2 legs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite its enormous population the world trading pattern of <span class="highlight">China</span> is simply not in the same class as those of a great many other trading nations, so let us not go overboard in our efforts to ingratiate ourselves with this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As he said, this is of wide interest to and has wide ramifications for many countries other than simply <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the situations obtaining in all South-East Asian states, in the Indian Ocean area and on the Indian sub-continent are affected greatly by the relationships existing between ‘Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span> and between all the other great powers operating in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cultural revolution had an enormous effect within <span class="highlight">China</span> in a number of areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can say to <span class="highlight">China</span>: ‘If you do not supply us with the materials we want we can always get them from the Russians’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if either Russia or <span class="highlight">China</span> markedly expands its influence, the other will react. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in <span class="highlight">China</span>’s long term interests for the situation to be stabilised until it can sort out its problems of economic development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other problem <span class="highlight">China</span> has, and which it is attempting to solve, is that of succession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These 2 problems bring about a situation in which, for the time being, <span class="highlight">China</span> would like to see a little more stability in the South-East Asian area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In returning from <span class="highlight">China</span> I passed through Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should realise that in fact they are defending their countries from the aggression of guerrillas who are financed by and trained in Soviet Russia and Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, which is a single party state, is also a member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can anyone from Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> support resolutions attacking any nation on the ground of discrimination, when one remembers what she did to the Tibetans? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new accords with <span class="highlight">China</span>, the so-called detente between the super powers, impressed them not one bit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the honourable member for Chisholm suggesting that we unrecognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have arrived at the question whether the Liberal Party, if it ever came back to power, would not continue to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opposition members will continue to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that the Australian Labor Government came to power at a time when the whole world’s approach to <span class="highlight">China</span> had changed not so much because of the attitude of the rest of the world to <span class="highlight">China</span> but because of the attitude of <span class="highlight">China</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> is a country that was seeking dialogue with the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I clearly recall in my own Party moves being made months ago to try to accommodate Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> without throwing down the drain our friends, the people of Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one point of difference between our policy on <span class="highlight">China</span> and that of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real reason why the former Government could not recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is that it had condemned the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> for so long that it did not want to take a complete political somersault which would have made it appear ridiculous in the eyes of the Australian community and the peoples of the world, particularly of South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I challenge him to deny this: He advocated that the time was ripe to drop the hydrogen bomb on the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> not so many years ago, but he never repeated it because powerful influences went to work - I think it was in the days when  Sir Robert  Menzies was Prime Minister - and warned him never to say it again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He advocated the bombing of women and children in the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, which was figthing for a new way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said: What is wrong with recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will go to Japan and probably move through that country with the delicacy of a herd of elephants in a <span class="highlight">china</span> shop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been no more certain or concrete piece of evidence relating to the change in identity of Australia as Australia than the announcement by the Minister for Overseas Trade  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  of the new contract for the sale of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do they want us not to recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> now that the contract has been signed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do they want us to say that we will wipe the contract and go back to not recognising the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> but recognising Taiwan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The members are Afghanistan; Bulgaria - both those countries are military dictatorships; Chile; Czechoslovakia, which is a satellite of the Soviet Union; Congo Brazzaville; Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> - I do not suppose that Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> could ever claim to be anything but a country that discriminates against Tibetans; Ethiopia- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course he now admits that even his Party would have recognised <span class="highlight">China</span> eventually. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer especially to the vital role that the Australian Government has played in creating the relationship with <span class="highlight">China</span> that has led to the signing of the greatest long term contract ever negotiated in any Australian rural commodity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The agreement sign’ -1 recently in Peking by the Australian Wheat t Board and the <span class="highlight">China</span> National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation guarantees the Australian wheat growers chat over the 3-year period they will be able to sell <span class="highlight">China</span> up to 4.7 million tonnes of wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not forget also that, as a result, Canada was given priority as a seller of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> because of the realistic step that the Canadians had taken in recognising <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thanks to the work of the Australian Labor Party and this Government, Australian wheat growers are now back in the <span class="highlight">China</span> market with the best arrangement ever made to guarantee an outlet for a large proportion of their produce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, he was a member of th - previous Government which could have taken the initiative to establish sensible relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> and could have taken steps to safeguard our wheat market in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where do the Oppos ition parties stand now on the question of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  claims that his Party would not disrupt the new relationship with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before he went to <span class="highlight">China</span> in July last, the Leader of the Opposition told a meeting of the Australian University Liberal Federation in Melbourne that a Liberal government would renew relations with Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means that a Liberal government - if ever elected - would treat Taiwan as a separate, independent government, separate from <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am convinced that this reactionary policy would ruin Australia’s long term wheal agreement with <span class="highlight">China</span> and wreck the possibility of it being renewed under a LiberalCountry Party government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the policy of the Country Party with respect to <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody knows for certain because their Leader, who has been preoccupied with trying to arrange a marriage of convenience with the Democratic Labor Party, has not had the courage to say whether he is for or against the recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, if the Country Party were ever returned to office it would jeopardise the relationship established by the Labor Government with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has negotiated long term stability for the wheat industry by the magnificent and successful negotiations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, I will come to <span class="highlight">China</span> in a minute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Immigration referred to sales to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What about sales to <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He virtually says that his Government made the sales to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Wheat Board - I am glad to see that the honourable member for Moore  (Mr Maisey)  is present because he had a very important part in this - was responsible for selling over $ 1,000m worth of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> today produces the type of wheat that is produced in large quantities in Australia and when the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must have given a great deal of encouragement to a great many people that the Prime Minister was able to deal with this matter in a most useful and constructive way in the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I informed the Chinese that because the 1973 crop now being harvested was tightly committed, particularly because of the suspension next year of the economic provisions in the current International Sugar Agreement and also because of the problem of bulk handling facilities in <span class="highlight">China</span>, it would not be possible for Australia to commence any agreement involving such huge amounts of sugar until 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The details of the agreement will be the subject of further discussions between the Australian sugar industry and the Chinese National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation and the Governments of <span class="highlight">China</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agreement by <span class="highlight">China</span> to purchase these very large quantities of Australian sugar each year, on a long term basis, is the culmination of continued discussions with <span class="highlight">China</span> initiated by myself during the Prime Minister’s visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> as Leader of the Opposition in July 1971 and subsequently carried on, as well as detailed discussions with <span class="highlight">China</span> by the Australian sugar industry, through the CSR Company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the agreement with <span class="highlight">China</span> will be of tremendous importance to the Australian sugar industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I visited <span class="highlight">China</span> recently with a parliamentary delegation I had some discussion with the Chinese public health officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my belief that an outlook which is far less materialistic in a country like <span class="highlight">China</span> conduces much less to mental illness than the materialistic, acquisitive society in which we live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of <span class="highlight">China</span>, long term arrangements over a 3-year period have been negotiated, involving about $600m in sales of wheat and about $250m in sales of sugar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the Queensland Sugar Board negotiated the first sale of sugar to <span class="highlight">China</span>, then negotiated the second sale - not of bagged sugar but in bulk - and has recently been in the process of negotiating a long term contract with the Chinese? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is totally untrue that the Queensland Sugar Board was in any way embarrassed or put in difficulties because of anything that the Minister for Northern Development did in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to point out quite clearly - obviously the Country Party does not know this - that sales of wheat and sugar to <span class="highlight">China</span> which continued through the 1960s were made in a totally different situation after 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Up to 1969 the diplomatic status of Taiwan was not significant for the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After 1969 the position was stated by the Premier of <span class="highlight">China</span>, by the Foreign Minister and by the Trade Minister to me more than once that after 1969 contracts would not be entered into for wheat or sugar with Australia except on a residual basis unless the attitude of the Australian Government to Taiwan was not that of identifying Taiwan as a separate country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 remind the House that that applies as much to the Opposition, and should it become the Government again it will have to put itself right in respect of Taiwan if it wants to continue doing business with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Northern Development,  Dr Patterson,  on his first visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> with the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister himself, were able to discover this and were able to see what was necessary for satisfactory relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ridiculous fiction that Taiwan was <span class="highlight">China</span> could not stand up to historical development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This stage has now passed and the possibilities for the unlimited, or almost unlimited, arrangements with <span class="highlight">China</span> that have come about in respect of wheat and sugar have been made possible only by that diplomatic event. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both visits were marked by great warmth on both sides; both visits were characterised by frankness and firmness from both sides; both visits notably advanced the interests of Australia and our friendship and understanding with these two great neighbours, Japan, and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> - from 31 October to 4 November, I was accompanied by the Treasurer and the Minister for Northern Development  (Dr Patterson). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">China</span> I consider that our visit symbolised the successful ending of a generation of lost contact between Australia and the most populous nation on earth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Japan is our major trading partner in the world and <span class="highlight">China</span> is the only one of the world’s 5 major powers with which, until last December, Australia has not had any meaningful or regular official contact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe my visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> was most valuable in restoring balance to our foreign policy and in diversifying our foreign relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the warmth of the reception I and my party received in Peking demonstrates that <span class="highlight">China</span> like Japan recognises, to a greater extent than some Australians may believe, the growing importance of Australia as a middle power, especially in the Asian and Pacific region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable members will know, important and valuable arrangements were made for the sale to <span class="highlight">China</span> of up to 300,000 tons of sugar a year for a three to five year period commencing in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was also agreed that we should develop a planned program of cultural, scientific, and technological exchanges between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span>, and that representative missions in these fields would be exchanged in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will be pleased to know that an understanding in principle was reached between the 2 sides on travel from <span class="highlight">China</span> to Australia by relatives of Australian citizens of Chinese descent and Chinese citizens residing in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that my visit will give new direction and increased momentum to our existing relationship with Japan and will lead to the development of a more meaningful relationship and a continuing dialogue with <span class="highlight">China</span> which, for so long - for much too long - has been a closed book to our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister and former Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Whitlam)  has made a brief statement and tabled documents relating to his recent journey to Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Prime Minister has developed our relationship with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party has made it clear on many occasions that it accepts the reality of Australia’s relationship with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When in Government last year we made some efforts to normalise relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Prime Minister, then Leader of the Opposition, conceded this in talks with the Chinese Premier as early as <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  has visited <span class="highlight">China</span>, symbolising the Liberal Party’s desire to strengthen relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>, despite the uncertainties and some of the difficulties we have faced in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister developed Australia’s dialogue with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must ask what the Prime Minister meant when he said that Australia’s new aspirations are symbolised more in our relationship with <span class="highlight">China</span> than with any other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ties with <span class="highlight">China</span> are important but there must be limits on the extent to which Australia’s ‘aspirations’ depend upon them or are symbolised by them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important also that the Australian people should know the extent of the Prime Minister’s commitment as an emissary explaining <span class="highlight">China</span>’s policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that if necessary he will explain to the countries in our region particularly the Association of South East Asian Nations, <span class="highlight">China</span>’s attitudes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Prime Minister forcefully put Australia’s opposition to <span class="highlight">China</span>’s pro-Arab stance and state that it is unacceptable to his Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He alleged in answer to a question on <span class="highlight">China</span> that the previous Government looked at a country’s ideology and then decided whether it would be friends’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface it by reminding honourable members that yesterday the Prime Minister told this House that he had made strong protests in <span class="highlight">China</span> about Chinese nuclear atmospheric testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Northern Development whether he is aware of the criticism that by securing the basis for a long-term sugar agreement with <span class="highlight">China</span> he undermined and damaged the Australian Sugar Board’s negotiating positon on quantities and price while the Board was engaged in negotiating a long-term contract with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it is true that the industry has been trying to secure permanent access for sugar to <span class="highlight">China</span> but without success. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I went to <span class="highlight">China</span> the CSR Company, in writing to me, said that the CSR is anxious to do all that it can to enlarge the opportunity for permanent access to <span class="highlight">China</span> and has welcomed the formal exchanges at government level which have undoubtedly strengthened the trading relationship established at the commercial level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">China</span> the Prime Minister and I achieved this access at permanent level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only person in this country who is trying to throw water on this sale to <span class="highlight">China</span> is the Leader of the Country Party who is in effect sabotaging the sugar industry and its future efforts in regard to the details of these negotiations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally I am concerned at the continuing tension between the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I returned from the parliamentary delegation tour of <span class="highlight">China</span> via Thailand and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Prime Minister see any paradox between his declaring that he will act as a bridge between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the outside world and his apparent inability to communicate with his own back bench? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A week ago I happened to have the opportunity to visit <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are welcomed but I think it is necessary to keep it all in perspective because we are selling 4 times as much sugar to the United States as we are likely to be selling to <span class="highlight">China</span> under this new long term contract, and we are selling 10 times as much sugar to Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would welcome as much effort being put into a long term contract for the sale of sugar to Japan as has been done in respect to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has again mentioned <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely he is aware that the industry asked me to secure permanent access for Australian sugar to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firsly, he said that Australia sells four times as much sugar to the United States of America as it will sell to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We shall sell at least 300,000 tons to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then went on to say that we sell ten times as much sugar to Japan as we will sell to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We sell approximately 600,000 tons to Japan, which is twice as much as we will sell to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that the Leader of the Country Party is aware that some of the honourable members who sit behind him are openly disgusted with his attitude towards the sale of sugar to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is what Hitler did, it is what Mussolini did, it is what is done in Russia, and it is what is done in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate the interjection because in the last couple of weeks we saw the Prime Minister of this country charter a Boeing 707 to travel to Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not true that in Washington on 30 July the Prime Minister said that <span class="highlight">China</span> was ‘obviously’ one of the countries which ought to be involved? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While accepting that the Government is flexible on the timing, structure and membership of any arrangements, will the Prime Minister say whether he sees any objections to <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union being included in the sort of Asia-Pacific arrangement which he has in fact already suggested? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some difficulties at this stage in having such a regional organisation because the countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations do not have active diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two of our fellow members of the South East Asian Treaty Organisation, the Philippines and Thailand, still recognise, however tenuously and faint heartily, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek as the  President  of all of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indonesia has always, since it was internationally recognised itself,- recognised the regime in Peking as the legitimate Government of the whole of <span class="highlight">China</span> including the Province of Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Malaysia and Singapore were British colonies at the time that Britain recognised the change of government in Peking and therefore technically they recognise the Government in Peking as the Government of the whole of <span class="highlight">China</span> including the Province of Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless Malaysia and Singapore have never had diplomatic relations with Peking or with any government purporting to be the Government of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But since some of those who sit behind him are less informed and responsible on these matters it is well to point out that the rival governments the governments which contend for recognition as the Government of <span class="highlight">China</span> have always agreed that Tibet was part of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and the Peking Government have always asserted in the whole world that Tibet was as much part of <span class="highlight">China</span> as they have both asserted that Taiwan was part of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that it is well to contemplate and there is no single country in the region which would reject the notion that <span class="highlight">China</span> must sooner or later be in any regional association for consultation in our region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The credibility of the man who did that is seriously under examination by the whole rural electorate, reinforced by his attempt to do the same thing in regard to sugar contracts with <span class="highlight">China</span> and wheat sales to Egypt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Discussions are being held in these areas in order to establish long term contracts for the sale of products to <span class="highlight">China</span> and Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I will refer to the Prime Minister’s recent trip to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have here a letter from an individual who is somewhat perturbed at some of the statements, which were made in <span class="highlight">China</span> recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of his lack of respect for our anthem in <span class="highlight">China</span>, I state quite bluntly that he did not represent me, and I hope that it will not be long before this arrogant buffoon- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a worn out cliche, just as the cliche about communism which the former Government employed for 20-odd years has now become worn out because  President  Nixon has gone to <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind Australia’s answer to Mohammed Ali that only a fortnight before his visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> the Canadian Prime Minister,  Mr Trudeau,  also had visited <span class="highlight">China</span>, had been received with the same organised enthusiasm, had secured a trade agreement to plan long term commerce between the  2  countries, had secured agreement to the establishment of the first non-communist consulate in <span class="highlight">China</span>, probably to the established Shanghai, and  Mr Trudeau  had also met  Chairman  Mao - but no shades of Cassius Clay from  Mr Trudeau. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also in <span class="highlight">China</span> the Prime Minister of Australia said that Australia’s new aspirations are symbolised more in our relationship with <span class="highlight">China</span> than our relationship with any other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ties with <span class="highlight">China</span> are important, but there must be limits on the extent to which Australian ‘aspirations’ depend upon them or are symbolised by them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman next mentioned <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have thought he would have shown a little modesty on this subject because he in fact was asked to visit <span class="highlight">China</span> while he was a Minister and his attendance was vetoed - there is some doubt whether it was vetoed by the leader of his Party or the Leader of the Country Party  (Mr Anthony). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not go to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the honourable gentleman supports the Australian Government’s establishment of diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have always given the honourable gentleman credit for pursuing an enlightened, contemporary point of view on many subjects such as Papua-New Guinea and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian Ministers are allowed to go to <span class="highlight">China</span> and are welcomed in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We now have the situation in <span class="highlight">China</span> as we had in Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our predecessors pursued the fruitless idea that one quarter of the world’s population could be ignored and that there could be recognised as the  President  of the whole of <span class="highlight">China</span> a man who has not set foot on the mainland since 1948 or 1949. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We at least wholeheartedly and promptly restored between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span> relations which should never have been severed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia wholeheartedly and uninhibitedly welcomes the change in our area brought about by the detente between the United States of America and <span class="highlight">China</span> and diplomatic relations between Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  presume to say that the Government of Singapore sooner or later will establish diplomatic relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said in answer to a question without notice by the honourable gentleman last week, technically Singapore recognises the existence of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has never recognised the pretentions of the Chiang Kai-shek regime in the province of Taiwan but it has not had diplomatic relations with Peking, that is, with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why, only a few weeks ago the *<span class="highlight">China</span> Mail’, one of Hong Kong’s 4 English daily newspapers, carried an attack on  Mr Whitlam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He stresses his concern not only at the situation in the Middle East but also at the deteriorating situation between the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span> and their constant border confrontations, with 67 divisions from each force facing one another across the boundary between the 2 countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular his journeys to <span class="highlight">China</span>, Japan and Ottawa have been seen as an assertion of Australia’s role not in our immediate region but in the world beyond that immediate area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I instance <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">China</span> there are children’s palaces to care for children after school hours, in other words, the latch key children, the children waiting till their parents come home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he was in <span class="highlight">China</span> recently did he call on Prince Norodom Sihanouk with the Australian Ambassador to <span class="highlight">China</span>,  Dr Fitzgerald,  and his personal private secretary,  Dr Wilenski? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, and  Dr Wilenski,  my principal private secretary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same goes for <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I very briefly - I too have only 10 minutes, unlike the Minister for Defence, who has unlimited time - want to refer to an article by Professor Arthur Burns, on which I have commented now on 2 previous occasions in this Parliament, in the ‘Bulletin’ of 10 November in which he refers to the conflict which might emerge between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia from the confrontation of 67 divisions on the ChinaSoviet border. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 2 particular problems that concern honourable members on this side of the House - firstly, the intervention in sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> and secondly, the intervention in sales to Egypt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is true that the representatives of the Australian Wheat Board when they visited <span class="highlight">China</span> last year had an offer to enter into a long term wheat contract. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Overseas Trade claims that it was his intervention alone which resulted in the 3-year wheat contract with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment wheat is in short demand throughout the world and anybody who thinks that the sale to <span class="highlight">China</span> was negotiated in a market where the Chinese were other than willing buyers knows nothing of world market conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> wants to buy our wheat, as indeed do so many other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had negotiations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> before the Labor Government came to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are looking at the politics of this matter, I think it can be said also that Canada attained better contracts than we did with <span class="highlight">China</span>, for political reasons, especially the fact that we knocked at the door at a later time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Board welcomed the market with open arms when the <span class="highlight">China</span> market went bad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to April 1971 when  Dr Rex  Patterson, who was then Labor’s shadow Minister for Primary Industry, directed a pointed question to the then Prime Minister,  Mr McMahon,  on political interference in the wheat trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all the contracts which have been made with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, it has been found necessary to include a clause strictly limiting the tonnages which the Chinese may nominate for loading at these ports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is timely to remind the Labor Party that in September last year the Australian Wheat Board sold to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> one million tons of wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidentally, total sales to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> over the past 10 years have been 16,485,600 tons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This gives a veritable rebuttal to the Minister for Overseas Trade and Secondary Industry as he then was, who said that the only body which could negotiate long term contracts with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> was a Labor Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the honourable member for Moore  (Mr Maisey)  on the magnificent contribution he has made in selling wheat to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> over many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was asked by the sugar industry before I went to <span class="highlight">China</span> to do 3 things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have always - and I do so again - paid a tribute to the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd for the pioneering work it has done in the last 2 years on aspects of our trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>, particularly with respect to bulk handling facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I gave credit to that company when I was in <span class="highlight">China</span> too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the reasons I have mentioned the intervention of the Minister for Overseas Trade  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  is the reservation I have because he in fact implied almost by way of blackmail to Australian wheat growers that if there should be a change of government there would be no future sales to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noticed in a newspaper the other day that a Royal Australian Air Force Hercules, if my memory serves me correctly, conveyed to <span class="highlight">China</span> a bull that had been presented by the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage we have almost lowered Australia’s prestige by the attitude that we have shown towards Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not, by any manner of means, saying that we should not have an association, that we should not trade or that we should not talk with Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, but there is no necessity, to my mind, for us to go as far as we have gone in our attitude to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does he realise that the answer he gave at his Press conference yesterday that Australian officials would not be allowed to visit Southern Rhodesia in a private capacity because you cannot divorce the private from the official life of an official directly contradicts the attitude he took last year when he argued that the then Minister for the Army should be permitted to visit the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in a private capacity without relinquishing his official position as Minister? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right honourable gentleman draws a comparison with the situation under his Government when, through whose veto nobody knows, the then Minister for the Army was precluded from visiting the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inhibitions which were then placed on the Minister for the Army visiting <span class="highlight">China</span> were not of an international character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were self-imposed by the then Australian Government, which adhered to the archaic notion that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek was still the  President  of the whole of <span class="highlight">China</span>, including not only the province of Taiwan, where he had been in residence for more than 2 decades, but also the mainland where the Minister for the Army of that time had been invited to make a visit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were no international reasons but only reasons based on sheer indigenous archaism why Australian Ministers were not able to visit the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am happy to say that those lost decades during which the Australian Government sought to impose a blackout - a veto - on communications with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> have now been happily forgotten. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker,  the Prime Minister implied, in an answer that he gave to a question by me in the House this morning, that my Government was not prepared to permit Ministers to visit the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, prior to recognition of that country, on an official invitation from the Chinese Government itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had made it clear that I was prepared to permit the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and the then Minister for Labour and National Service to visit the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> if an official invitation was received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point is this: The Prime Minister must know, as he was Foreign Minister for a short period, that the advice tendered to me as the Prime Minister was that the then Minister for the Army could not visit the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in a private capacity- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  second point relates to the fact that the Prime Minister, having ‘been the Minister for Foreign Affairs for a short period of time, will know that the recommendation given to me by both the Department of Foreign Affairs and the then Minister for Foreign Affairs who is now a Justice of the New South Wales Court of Appeal was that a Minister would not be able to visit the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in a personal capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It ought to be supplying 20 per cent as that is the world average figure, excluding the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will recall that the Australian Labor Party, at its own expense, sent a delegation to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We were accused of trying to make friends with Red <span class="highlight">China</span> or Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It cannot be Red <span class="highlight">China</span> and Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> one day, and Nationalist <span class="highlight">China</span> and Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> the next day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential in the view of the Government, and it was essential in the view of preceding governments, that there should be diplomatic relations between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been no dispute between the political parties in the Australian Parliament that there ought to be recognition by the Australian Government of a government of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Except for an interval between 1949 or 1950 and 1966, when there was an ambassador from the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in Australia but not an ambassador from Australia in Taipeh, the capital of  ti  Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, there has been diplomatic representation by each country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The dispute between the political parties in the Australian Parliament has been about which was the government of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our predecessors took the attitude, from 1949 to the end of their period in office, that they should recognise as the government of <span class="highlight">China</span> the government headed by Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek and resident in Taipeh, the capital of the province of Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Party had taken the attitude since 1955  -  I myself had expressed the attitude since 1954  -  that Australia should recognise the government in Peking as the government of <span class="highlight">China</span>, lt has not been possible for any country to have diplomatic relations with or to extend recognition to both the government in Taipeh and the government in Peking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every other government in the world has had to make a choice as to which of those rival governments it would recognise as the government of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both rival governments asserted that their writ ran or should run over the whole of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both rival governments asserted, and still assert, that Taiwan is a province of one country - <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both also have asserted that Tibet is part of one country - <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some minor border differences between them concerning Mongolia, North Vietnam or some other countries, but on matters such as Taiwan and Tibet and their position in the country of <span class="highlight">China</span> there has never been any dispute between the 2 rival governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever other countries may think or whatever people in Australia or successive governments in Australia may think about the geographical or political realitities of the situation, the fact is that one can have recognition of a government of <span class="highlight">China</span> or have diplomatic relations with a government of <span class="highlight">China</span> only on the basis of there being one government of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 7 November 1973, after the Prime Minister’s return from his recent visit to Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span>, he spoke in the House about those visits and tabled certain documents relating to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matter has been taken up by the Visual Arts Board of the Australian Council for the Arts and the procedures and costs that would be involved if the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> were to allow the exhibition to come to Australia are being examined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-54-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is enough for me to say that 1 welcome the continuing detente in relations between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the United States and the continuing detente between each of those countries and some others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are no longer in thrall to bogies and obsessions in our relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> or the great powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In its relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, my Government will make further efforts to develop the understanding and accord already achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740228_reps_28_hor88/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While our foreign policy interests have been diversified and our horizons are now wider than the United States, the United Kingdom and South East Asia - we no longer ignore, for example, the existence of Communist Asia, including <span class="highlight">China</span> with its 800 million people - the fact remains that it is in our own immediate neighbourhood that we are most likely to find an effective role for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I found that the new friendships which we have developed with countries like <span class="highlight">China</span> and North Vietnam have in no way diminished our traditional friendships with the countries I visited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the sixties the main thrust of United States policy in this area was the containment of <span class="highlight">China</span> by military involvement in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular, we now have very greatly improved relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>, a country which was deliberately isolated from 1949 until last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There were no sales of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> last year, but so far this year we have sold $17m worth of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The total value of those few items that we have sold to <span class="highlight">China</span> has increased from $19.3m to $58. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And as should have been well known, Tun Razak, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, who so recently duchessed the Prime Minister in Kuala Lumpur, and not so long ago duchessed me as well, the author of the idea of a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality, has stated over and over again that his proposals are for the distant future and will require the guarantees of security, territorial integrity and independence by the super powers, the United States of America and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The long term wheat and sugar agreements recently negotiated between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span>, and the rice agreement with Indonesia, should be of value to Australian producers insofar an they ensure that a guaranteed quantity of each commodity will be sold over a specified period at world prices to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nobody would say that a country such as <span class="highlight">China</span> should be ignored, but to have discussions or an association with a country does not mean that we have to give away every single piece of prestige. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Country Party thinks these things do not matter and that it is better to bury its head in the sand, to pretend that <span class="highlight">China</span> is not a country at all, and that one-third of the world’s population does not exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister considers only the advantages of a multi-polar system; not the complications it also brings to the region through competition for influence, whether by the USSR against the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> or whether it be through competition because of the growing Japanese economic influence in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it was on 20 December last the Chinese communist government launched an attack on the islands in the <span class="highlight">China</span> Sea which had been occupied by South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My own view is that probably South Vietnam had the best claim but <span class="highlight">China</span>  did  put forward a colourable claim and I think the Philippines also put through a colourable claim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When  it found  that Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, which is on the Security Council with the power of veto, was going to exercise that power it wrote a pathetic  note  to the  President  of the Security Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the permanent delegate of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations Security Council had subsequently issued a thoroughly negative statement, presenting a distorted version of the facts and clinging to the false claims of Chinese sovereighty over the Hoang-Sa (Paracels) and Truong-Sa (Spratley) archipelagoes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is apermanent member of the Security Council and has veto power, this leaves little hope for any constructiva debate or positive action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, I wish to inform you that all my communications to the Security Council are for the purpose of drawing the attention of the Council to the grave situation existing in the South-East Asia region as a result of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s encroachment on the Republic of Vietnam’s territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is stronger than the claim of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> to these islands but neither is beyond question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Notwithstanding the great claims made by the Minister for Overseas Trade, who, in a deceptive and treacherous manner, seeks to mislead the people of Australia by saying that the Government has saved the wheat industry, those of us who have some practical experience in the industry know that long before he became a Minister the Australian Wheat Board sold not 4 million tons of wheat to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> but 16 million tons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the  Deputy  Prime Minister were genuine in his belief and his expressions of his point of view, would he resort to the devious device of saying that the Royal Australian Air Force uniforms are not acceptable in Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The farcical reason given for this was that the uniforms of the Royal Australian Air Force officers on the aircraft were not acceptable to the Peoples ‘ Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is pure and utter, unadulterated, 5 -star hogwash because when a Murray grey bull was sent to <span class="highlight">China</span> it was taken there by the Royal Australian Air Force and the members of the Air Force who took it did not have to strip off and get into a pair of BVDs or anything when they arrived in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He also tried to make capital out of the fact that the Acting Prime Minister  (Dr J. F.

    <p>The quarantine legislation which prohibits imports of shaving brushes from many countries including <span class="highlight">China</span>, is at present under review to take into account modern manufacturing technology methods which may have diminished the risk of anthrax transmission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This will mean that the Asian trade with countries besides Japan- countries like the Philippines, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore and Malaysia- will benefit from the Australian Shipping Commission bringing in an increased number of ships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unlike his  Deputy,  the Minister for Overseas Trade  (Dr J. F.

  <li>
    <p>Let the honourable member for Wilmot answer this one: The Government spent thousands of dollars on a display in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  went to <span class="highlight">China</span> to see it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What plans does the Government have for trying to stimulate overseas trade in the export of beef cattle7 Never mind about crawling and snivelling to the Chinese at a display in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have also established new overseas markets, particularly in <span class="highlight">China</span>, for wool and wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We then instituted immediately a system of negotiating voluntary restraints with overseas exporting countries- Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, India and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>- with considerable success. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister for Overseas Trade and the Minister for Manufacturing Industry tell the House and these people whether they have sold out the textile, clothing and footwear industries to their communist friends in <span class="highlight">China</span> and other places? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result the Textiles Authority, which was set up within the Industries Assistance Commission, recommended restraints to take effect from 1 July on the following products: Items of knitwearmen’s and boys’ shirts; coats, cardigans, jumpers, sweaters, women’s blouses, shirts and the like; dresses; tracksuits, playsuits, rompersuits in respect of imports from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Republic of Korea and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>; women’s and girls’ dresses, blouses and shirts of woven fabric in respect of imports from India and Hong Kong; and women’s, girls and infants’ coats of woven fabric in respect of imports from Hong Kong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the finest records of this Government so far, for which it does not get any credit, is the way it has extended markets for our rural products, particularly in <span class="highlight">China</span> and other parts of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Wilmot  (Mr Duthie)  concluded his speech by praising the Minister for Overseas Trade  (Dr J. F.

  <li>
    <p>But he sits opposite; if he did, he would know or he should know that this is exactly what we have negotiated in the terms of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade with India, <span class="highlight">China</span> and Korea- no, not with Korea because it would not be in it and we had to take action unilaterally at our own end pursuant to our international agreements under the GATT arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is a representative of a party that during its whole period in office continued to ignore one quarter of the world’s population- the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> or communist <span class="highlight">China</span> as members of the Opposition still prefer to call it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will it revoke Australia’s recognition of communist <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been fortunate this past year in being able to study at first hand Australia’s relationships with the United States of America, Canada, Malaysia, Thailand, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Japan and the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-People have been waiting 25 years for different policies in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and in the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, but we do not hear much about that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, should we by recognising the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> desert the people of Taiwan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts are that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> considers Taiwan to be a province of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the People’s Republic will not, in any circumstances, exchange diplomatic emissaries with any country which recognises Taiwan as a separate entity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do we choose Taiwan or <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taiwan is in exactly the same position in <span class="highlight">China</span>’s view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> maintains that Taiwan is a province of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason <span class="highlight">China</span> will not accept recognition of Taiwan by any other country and would not exchange diplomatic emissaries with Australia if we recognised Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have visited the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and it has no objection- contrary to what the honourable member for Maranoa says- to other countries trading with Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the latest development is for the Chinese Government to encourage Taiwanese people to visit <span class="highlight">China</span> in certain circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason we recognised <span class="highlight">China</span> and we recognised North Vietnam, and on the other extreme we recognised Chile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

    <p>I was impressed by the way <span class="highlight">China</span> had increased its knowledge in the comparatively short period between the 2 visits of the viewpoints of the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I recollect a previous Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Clem Attlee, saying some years ago that he was very frightened indeed of the lack of knowledge in <span class="highlight">China</span> of the viewpoints of the rest of the world and that the sooner the isolation of <span class="highlight">China</span> was ended the better it would be for the peace of the whole world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indonesia in particular has a profound distrust of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> and knows that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Dr J. F.

    <p>and (2) On 11 October 1973 the then Minister for Overseas Trade,  Dr Cairns,  issued a public statement concerning the negotiation of a Long-Term Wheat Agreement between the Australian Wheat Board and the <span class="highlight">China</span> National Cereals Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to announcing that the Agreement is for a period of three years commencing 1 January 1974 and provides for the sale of up to 4.7 million tonnes,  Dr Cairns  drew particular attention to the fact that the LongTerm Agreement had been negotiated specifically in accordance with the Trade Agreement between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span> which had been signed in July 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Government or the Prime Minister used the fact of their friendly relationships with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and asked either of those nations to stop providing North Vietnamese regular troops in South Vietnam with arms or other forms of support? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the heady days when Vietnam was a popular war, when it was a political goldmine, before the people of Australia came to see its implications and consequences for Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, for Australia, for the United States, the constant challenge made in this House, not least from the present Leader of the Opposition, was, ‘stand up and be counted’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am absolutely staggered that anybody who pretends to comprehend Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> would come back with the old Democratic Labor Party statement, the League of Rights statement, the point of view that has been held by reactionary forces in Australia and throughout the world, that old tired cliche about people voting with their feet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, as in the old days with Diem and the Geneva Agreements, when the important thing was the elections throughout the whole of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> which Diem, with the support of the United States and the Australian Governments, did not allow to come to pass, exactly the same thing has happened with Thieu, who has argued against the National Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are all matters of fact, not matters of a fleeting visit to Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The folk who put forward that proposition completely ignore the fact that there is probably as much difference between the Soviet Union and the United States as there is between the Soviet Union and Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Article 7- the oneforone replacement provision- has been demontrably breached by North Vietnam, by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and by the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the inclinations of the Government of North Vietnam have been contributed to in an alarming degree by the Government of the Soviet Union and the Government of the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, this is only the second occasion, apart from the travelogues which he occasionally effects, on which the Prime Minister has reported to us on what is happening and then not Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> but South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I want to do is to try, first of all, to indicate my disappointment that this is not a statement on the whole of the circumstances of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we seek is the intervention by the Government of Australia, with the Government of North Vietnam, the Government of the U.S.S.R. and with the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in order to ensure that it might be a realistic cease fire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Paris Accords, which set down a prescription by which the lives and livelihoods of the people of the region could be protected, are now being breached entirely in their military aspects by North Vietnam, the U.S.S.R. and the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I have heard all the versions of the Vietnam debate from the time when it was a question of maintaining French authority in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> to the debate that is current in Australia today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say that I believed  Sir Robert  Menzies when I was a young man and I thought Australia had an interest in maintaining French rule in IndoChina. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first attitude about the maintenance of French rule in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> was a standard Australian attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am old enough in this Parliament to remember that everybody in IndoChina who opposed the continuance of French rule in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> was classified as a ‘red’- and that included Diem, who was later for a time supported by the U.S. Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Well, the succession states of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> consist of Laos, Cambodia or the Khmer Republic, and the 2 Vietnams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have the extraordinary spectacle of the  Deputy  Leader of the Country Party, the honourable member for New England, asking the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  to get assurances from communist governments that nobody would be slaughtered and then saying: ‘You cannot believe communist governments anyway; look at the result of their agreements in Paris and elsewhere over the whole of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for the thesis of Chinese primary interest in this, <span class="highlight">China</span> would be totally undisturbed if we sent one million men from Australia back into <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It did not matter to <span class="highlight">China</span> if the French fought for 10 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It did not matter to <span class="highlight">China</span> if the Americans fought for 7 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is perfectly clear what their major preoccupation is, and it is not Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government approach the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and <span class="highlight">China</span> to seek observance of the Paris Agreement <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to some people in the world, it was important that the power struggle be brought into play, that the Foster Dulles concept of <span class="highlight">China</span> being contained be immediately implemented in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the assistance to North Vietnam from <span class="highlight">China</span> and from the Soviet Union continued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same situation exists with Vietnam and <span class="highlight">China</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But what is the free world, the United Nations, indeed Australia, doing to ensure that tens of thousands of innocent people are not massacred in the wake of the communist advance in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agrarian reform campaign was carried out under the supervision of Chinese cadres familiar with the similar campaign in <span class="highlight">China</span>, and Truong Chinh identified himself publicly with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He makes the claim that, becuse of the recognition of Hanoi and <span class="highlight">China</span>, Australia has been placed in a position where it can bring about, where it is bringing about a cease fire, or at least is attempting to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For what reason other than strategic reasons would <span class="highlight">China</span> have played a major part in the construction of this railway in the southern part of the African continent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, with regard to the matter of detente to which I referred earlier, surely Australia and the rest of the free world should take careful note of a speech reported to have been made by the Premier of the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, Chou En-lai, at the Fourth National People’s Congress in Peking last January. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we would all agree that these are very disturbing words, to say the least, and if in fact there is no detente in the eyes of the leaders of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> then surely it is high time that the free world made a re-assessment of the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The long term wheat agreement between the Australian Wheat Board and the <span class="highlight">China</span> National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation was signed on 18 October, 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Agreement provided for the sale of up to 4.7 million tonnes of Australian wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> over a period of three years from 1 January, 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (4) The Agreement specifies only the base quantities which are to be sold by the Australian Wheat Board to the <span class="highlight">China</span> National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation during the three years of the Agreement; these are 1.1 million tonnes in 1974 and from 1.5 to 1.8 million tonnes in each of 1 975 and 1 976, giving a total of up to 4.7 million tonnes over the three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No; the Agreement provides for actual quantities to be negotiated each year according to availability of supplies from Australia and the requirements of <span class="highlight">China</span> within the stipulated base quantities, with provision for quantities to be increased above the base levels, by mutual agreement as to quantity and price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The arrangements are embodied in a formal agreement between the Australian Wheat Board and the <span class="highlight">China</span> National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation the full details of which are confidential as between these parties; but see answers ( 1 ) to (5) above. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (8) The Australian Wheat Board, as seller, does have a contractual obligation to supply wheat to the <span class="highlight">China</span> National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation, which for its part, has an obligation to buy Australian wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly what is happening in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> at the present time does have an impact on other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is also equally clear that what is likely to happen in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> over the next few days will have an impact on other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister had his way and if that organisation were embroidered, lengthened and expanded to include <span class="highlight">China</span> and North Vietnam it would be dominated by those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of these changes- this comes not from an Opposition judgment but from judgments inside <span class="highlight">China</span>- the Sino-Soviet dispute competition is likely to become more intense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Depending upon the future alliance of the North Vietnamese regime or its degree of independence from Russia or <span class="highlight">China</span>, there is a potential for adding to that feeling of encirclement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If North Vietnam stands aside from that dispute it might be a different matter, but hitherto the North Vietnamese have been closer to the Soviet Union than to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>’s feeling of encirclement is very real indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely we could argue that the tension between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is a sign of peace for South-East Asia, for if these two great countries are in conflict how are they going to combine to subvert South-East Asia in a communist campaign? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do not wish to tear up the recognition agreement with <span class="highlight">China</span>, with North Vietnam and with North Korea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Opposition Parties had been in Government it would have been impossible to send even a communication to North Vietnam because they would have continued to hide their heads, ostrich-like, as they did for over 2 decades in relation to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>According to the authoritative, well documented articles in the ‘National Times’, our action was for our own selfish ends and to satisfy  Sir Robert  Menzies ‘ paranoid fears of red, or yellow, hordes invading us from the north, because  Sir Robert’s  simplistic solution for the whole problem was to interpose the American military machine between Australia and Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Th  j  whole rotten structure came down in the same way as it did in <span class="highlight">China</span>, because South Vietnam lacked leaders and a government which understood the needs of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No doubt mindful of America’s great failure in <span class="highlight">China</span>, Hubert Humphrey, President Johnson’s VicePresident, said last week concerning the outcome in Vietnam: ‘No outside force can save a country that lacks will or political leadership. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The threat arises in this way: The Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span> have great enmity towards each other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we want a United States presence in the Indian Ocean as a balancing force to the competition between the Soviet and <span class="highlight">China</span> then we must encourage the United States naval and air power into the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One major obstacle to the development of broad and constructive regional co-operation has been the war in Indochina. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, in their meeting in Kuala Lumpur in May 1 975, the ASEAN Foreign Ministers pledged themselves to continuing efforts to promote greater regional co-operation in SouthEast Asia with specific reference to their readiness to enter into friendly and harmonious relations with the new governments in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Look at the double-speak: The reality is that, while we were fighting in Vietnam and while the same right honourable gentleman was sending Australian boys to their death, his Government was still trading with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We did not hear any bleating from the National Country Party or its supporters, the wheat growers, about the fact that the honourable member for Lalor,  Dr J.  F.

    <p>I believe that a country such as Australia has to accommodate itself with places such as <span class="highlight">China</span>, Russia on its eastern front, Siberia- it will not be divided into two in our lifetimeand the centrally planned economies; that is, those who want to do business in Australia and nearly all of whom are represented here diplomatically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is a market on which Australia has always sold wheat, and whilst the present Government makes great play of the claim that more wheat has been sold to <span class="highlight">China</span> while it has been in office, that claim is a fallacy because when the Liberal and Country Parties were in government huge sales of wheat were made to <span class="highlight">China</span>, particularly in our last year of office, 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like him to address his remarks to the Leader of the National Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  who, when opposing the Overseas Trading Corporation legislation, spoke as though we were encouraging what he deemed to be our commie mates, by which I think he meant Russia, <span class="highlight">China</span> or any other country to which we are anxious to sell our rural products at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been an unfortunate aspect of Australian politics that the exploitation of foreign affairs during the 1950s and 1960s and the plight of Asia during that period clouded both the achievement of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the ability and achievements of the individuals in the Government of <span class="highlight">China</span>, one of whom was the Premier, Chou En-lai. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is obvious that the future of SouthEast Asia is going to depend principally on the relationship between Australia, Japan, <span class="highlight">China</span>, India and, to a lesser extent, the United States and the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within that orbit there will continue to be potential for a growing conflict of interest between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have seen in Angola, and <span class="highlight">China</span>’s reaction to Russia’s involvement in Angola, is symptomatic of the fact that wherever one of them moves there is going to be a counter reaction from the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But whereas <span class="highlight">China</span>’s capacity to undertake any activity in Africa is obviously limited by geographical factors, that is certainly not the situation in South-East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe quite firmly that if the Soviet Union increases its influence in South-East Asia, through North Vietnam for example, a point will be reached where <span class="highlight">China</span> might well have to consider taking action in its own interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The one thing that <span class="highlight">China</span> is terrified of today is that it is going to be surrounded by the Soviet Union, its growing navy and its satellites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, policies adopted by North Vietnam and North Korea and the long term future development of Japan, is of fundamental importance not only to <span class="highlight">China</span> but also to the entire South-East Asian region, in fact to the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>More than 60 per cent of Australia’s commodity trade surplus for 1974-75-that is, $300m out of a total of $5 80m- is accounted for by our other Asian trading partners such as <span class="highlight">China</span>, Singapore and Thailand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last Tuesday, included amongst many silly and pretentious performances in this House and its surroundings, there were a series of motions of condolence for recently deceased Prime Ministers, Premiers and Heads of State in Nigeria, <span class="highlight">China</span> and Malaysia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was no accident that I went on the first all Party parliamentary mission to <span class="highlight">China</span> and I must say now that I wish to assure  His Excellency,  the Chinese Ambassador here, and  Dr Fitzgerald  that there are many people in this country who are most anxious to improve cultural relations between the 2 nations and I will do all I can to assist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>De Gaulle was the first significant foreign affairs spokesman to recognise the significance of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s fear of the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>, studying the possibility of her own destruction, decided that the United States could not destroy <span class="highlight">China</span> but that the Soviet Union could, and that the Soviet occupation of Hungary and Czechoslovakia was a claim to supervise other communist powers in the way that everybody supervised <span class="highlight">China</span> in the nineteenth century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>, finding this prospect intolerable, broke with the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this context I fully support the Governor-General’s statement that bilateral relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> will be further developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 reason- the failure to recognise Red <span class="highlight">China</span> at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The relationship which Japan will build between the Soviet Union on the one hand and <span class="highlight">China</span> on the other could cause tensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In strategy too, we realise that we are also to be friends with <span class="highlight">China</span> and all our neighbours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So I say that communism is at work in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, Malaysia and Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Russia, Cuba and <span class="highlight">China</span> are all hell-bent on pushing South Africa, as a white nation and a bulwark against communism, into the sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And who rules these countries which are taking over in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> and in Africa? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The newspapers state ‘communist victories in Indo <span class="highlight">China</span> and United States setbacks in the region had combined to the point where the prospects for revolt had never been so good.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1905 when all the imperialist countries met in Shanghai to divide up <span class="highlight">China</span> the only country that was not present to discuss what was to happen to the future of <span class="highlight">China</span> was <span class="highlight">China</span> herself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All those observing the internal politics of <span class="highlight">China</span> predicted to the outside world, as was indicated hi Edgar Snow’s book  Red Star Over <span class="highlight">China</span>,  what would happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Who took control of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia no longer persists with a stupid policy of ignoring the 800 million people of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One needs only to look at the countries of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>- at Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, on the forthcoming visit to <span class="highlight">China</span>, for which very worthwhile arrangements have been made by the Chinese, about half the number of people who accompanied the former Prime Minister will be accompanying me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Laos at the present time <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia are vying for the final control of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Thailand there are the attempts by the communists, mainly from <span class="highlight">China</span>, to rid that country of the last units of the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For years the present Prime Minister and his colleagues stirred the same irrational hatred of <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Soviet Union is an authoritarian and totalitarian country, but we have a distinction on the part of this Government between the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  government’s strong denunciation of Soviet and Cuban involvement in Angola, its support for the American build-up in the Indian Ocean and most lately the joint defence talks with New Zealand have received favourable publicity in the government-controlled Press in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure other members of this House who have visited SouthEast Asia know what fear there is in South-East Asia of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are many regimes in Eastern Europe of the same type and of course there are now a number of regimes in Asia and Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> of this extreme kind, and <span class="highlight">China</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will find that this same situation pertains in countries such as Canada, the United States of America, the Soviet Union, <span class="highlight">China</span> and India. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Several arguments were put forward in the United Nations Security Council, ranging from the views of Indonesia, supported by the Philippines and Malaysia on the one hand, to those advanced by Fretilin supported by <span class="highlight">China</span>, Mozambique, Guinea Bissau and the honourable member for Fraser on the other hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is no accident that one of my first international visits- the first planned visit other than my visit to New Zealand- is to Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To illustrate this crucial and central point, I quote from a journal called the  New <span class="highlight">China</span> News  which is put out by Peking <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a world whose relations also depend, however, on the actions of other major powers- <span class="highlight">China</span>, Japan and the European powers- and within particular regions also on the distribution of power between middle and small states. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not in <span class="highlight">China</span>’s interests that the Soviet Union should become dominant in South East Asia, nor in Japan’s interests that the Soviet Union should become dominant in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, it is not, presumably, in the Soviet Union’s interests that relations between <span class="highlight">China</span>, Japan and the United States should be too close. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have advocated friendship and understanding towards <span class="highlight">China</span> since I entered this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all I have advocated that Australia recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>’s central role in the affairs of our region and her rightful claim to a place in the world community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I have never supposed that friendship with <span class="highlight">China</span> required a wholehearted endorsement of <span class="highlight">China</span> ‘s foreign policy, any more than friendship with the United States required a wholehearted support of American foreign policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we look back on the Prime Minister’s statements on <span class="highlight">China</span> we will see how sudden and remarkable his conversion to the cause of SinoAustralia friendship has been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1965 he lumped <span class="highlight">China</span> in with Indonesia as a new kind of double-barrelled Asian menace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As late as August 1973 he was still portraying <span class="highlight">China</span> as the chief obstacle to harmony and progress in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has irresponsibly exploited statements made by American leaders for domestic electioneering purposes in support of an alarmist policy completely out of keeping with the  real politik  in which the highly sensitive relationship between the United States, the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span> is based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-The House may recall that on the last day of the last session of Parliament I endeavoured to speak on the attitude of the honourable member for MacKellar  (Mr Wentworth)  with regard the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was gagged after speaking for about 20 seconds, because the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  was about to visit <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was rumoured at the time that he was to precede the Prime Minister to <span class="highlight">China</span> to make advance arrangements for his reception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> should understand the attitude of supporters of the Government and the views that they have expressed in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be used to destroy the factories which are making nuclear material in <span class="highlight">China</span>- not war with the Chinese people, not wholesale destruction in any way at all, but simply the removal from their hands of the weapons whereby humanity can be destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again on 11 May 1966 he referred to the division between the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the really important thing here is that the honourable member for Mackellar, who is a close associate of the Prime Minister and, as is very well known indeed, is a close adviser of the Prime Minister, had this to say about the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the more important thing is that the people of the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> should know and understand that that is the attitude of members of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the present moment there is a split between the two communist giants- the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and communist Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither side, whether it be in the cleavage between Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span> or in the cleavage between the communists and the democratic world, dare resort to the kind of force that could destroy both it and the people it attacks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister made certain suggestions in <span class="highlight">China</span> that the Chinese Government is our friend- the present Prime Minister was Minister for Defence at the time of our sorry record in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was, as honourable members will know, the principal architect of <span class="highlight">China</span> since 1949 and one of the very few men who had a major impact on the course of world history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He led the Chinese Communist Party through a long and destructive civil war and in his writings set out a new conception of what <span class="highlight">China</span> could be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time in many decades Mao Tse-tung gave <span class="highlight">China</span> an effective administration, restored a country ravaged by civil war and secured the basic necessities of life to <span class="highlight">China</span>’s people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He sought for <span class="highlight">China</span> self-reliance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under his leadership <span class="highlight">China</span> assumed a major role in world affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mao Tse-tung ‘s conception of the desirable organisation of a society was not and is not ours, but he achieved peace internally and respect for <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He came to symbolise the new <span class="highlight">China</span> for his own people and for the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In recent years under his leadership <span class="highlight">China</span> began to adjust her ideological objectives to the realities of world power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For Australians it is of considerable significance that as <span class="highlight">China</span>’s supreme leader he lent his personal authority to the establishment and further development of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s relations with Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the closing years of his life important steps were taken in the improvement of friendship and mutual understanding between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Australia- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That this House records its sincere regret at the death of Chairman Mao Tse-tung, expresses to the people of <span class="highlight">China</span> profound regret and tenders its deep sympathy to his family in their bereavement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> and the world have now lost the second of the 2 great figures who dominated the country’s history for most of the 20th century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All parties, though some more readily and graciously than others, have come to acknowledge the place of <span class="highlight">China</span> in the world and the stature of her leaders, both as contemporary statesmen and historical personalities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas Chou was preeminently the skilled administrator and interpreter of <span class="highlight">China</span> to the world, Mao was the inspiration to the Chinese people themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was the authentic father of his people and the new <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was a man who dominated his country’s history and development for half a century, guiding it from a state of political and economic collapse in the 1920s through the troughs and peaks of its development to the thriving, self-reliant and internationally respected nation that <span class="highlight">China</span> is today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the people of <span class="highlight">China</span> Mao was not only respected, he was loved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His inspired analysis of the Chinese situation led to the recognition of the key role to be played by the masses of the people, who in <span class="highlight">China</span> were the peasants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mao also based his strategy for the revolution and for a new <span class="highlight">China</span> on a belief about the nature of man which is very different from the beliefs that dominate our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He believed that through persuasion and example, through correct ideology, people’s attitudes could be changed so that they would cast aside selfish considerations and, in the interests of all people, commit themselves to the tough struggle to build a new <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, <span class="highlight">China</span> has undertaken a process in which material incentives are being steadily abandoned in favour of moral incentives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of <span class="highlight">China</span> have inherited the fruits of his work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will undoubtedly be struggles ahead in the course of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s continuing revolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, my visits to <span class="highlight">China</span>, particularly the second visit a few months ago, have left me totally convinced that, for the Chinese people, no struggle is too great and that the will of the vast majority of the people will undoubtedly prevail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His thoughts have guided the Chinese revolution for 50 years and they will live long in the future achievements of new <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mao Tse-tung took charge of a <span class="highlight">China</span> which was weak, divided and exhausted, and created a nation which was unified, formidable and dedicated to the destruction of freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That occurred nearly 20 years ago when <span class="highlight">China</span>, having then no nuclear weapons, could only urge and could not herself act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do so enthusiastically because with the passing of Mao it has been a very sad year for <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the passing of those 3 men in one year we can look at the remarkable history of <span class="highlight">China</span> since the formation of the Communist Party in 1921. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chinese Communist Party was almost wiped out in the Long March of 1934-36 but these men won sufficient support within their country to be able to take over the government of the country in 1949 and be the first government in history to unify <span class="highlight">China</span> and have the support of all the Chinese people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it speaks well of Australia and perhaps the maturity of our foreign affairs politics that the last 2 Prime Ministers of this country have visited <span class="highlight">China</span> and have seen the significance of <span class="highlight">China</span> in terms of future relations for Australia in this region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not dwell too much on earlier relationships between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span> but rather see ourselves as partners working towards stability within our own region, and recognising the great part that this remarkable man has played for his country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I expect, knowing a little of Chinese history, that the Chinese would regard themselves as having been rescued from the humiliation which they suffered with the decay of the Manchu dynasty; the period of unequal treaties when Western imperialistic powers- and they could truly be described as imperialistic colonial powers of that period- brazenly exploited and plundered <span class="highlight">China</span>, sought to undermine the confidence of the people of that country and to sap any strength and cohesion which Chinese society may have had, in order to exploit <span class="highlight">China</span> commercially. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that people should lose sight of the fact that after promising a revolution to restore the pride, confidence and strength of the Chinese empire, Chiang Kai-shek first turned the machine guns on the striking workers in Shanghai in the early 1920s- workers who had struck to facilitate his takeover of the country- then proceeded to collaborate with the very people who had been responsible for the destruction and subjection of <span class="highlight">China</span> for so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He subsequently collaborated with the Japanese occupiers of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the system of government, whatever we may think about the ideology of communism, has proved particularly successful in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the future of mankind would be better served if, instead of trying to cut off and isolate countries with different ideologies and systems of government- countries like <span class="highlight">China</span>- we worked more towards involving them in world affairs and in associations with other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I found the statements of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  on his recent visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> a little fulsome in some respects, they were far preferable to the antithesis of his sort of approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fulsome or not, at least they were helpful and showed a better understanding of the need to welcome <span class="highlight">China</span> ‘s and the Chinese people’s participation in world affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> is worse because of that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sincerely trust that <span class="highlight">China</span> and the world will be well served by having to succeed him a man of at least somewhere near equal competence in all respects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Foolishly, the former Opposition in its blind opposition to anything any opponent of the Labor Party cares to call socialist rushed in like a bull in a <span class="highlight">china</span> shop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I attach a great deal more importance to the brilliant analysis by the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  last week of the problem of <span class="highlight">China</span> than I do to much of the advice given by the Department of Foreign Affairs on <span class="highlight">China</span> specifically and on communism generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At least now he has been to places like Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span> and is willing to acknowledge that Australia has to live with these parts of the world which contain more than a quarter of its population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I need only to refer to the Government’s attitude to <span class="highlight">China</span> as one small bit of hope on the horizon, and the Government’s attitude to South Africa, which is another case in point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the same visit he made his fatuous proposal that a 4-power arrangement between <span class="highlight">China</span>, Japan, Australia and the United States should be reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fear of <span class="highlight">China</span>, fear of Indonesia, fear of Japan- it is all part of the same insistent, neurotic pattern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The great fear at that time by the conservatives was the downward thrust of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His indiscretions in <span class="highlight">China</span>, his hawkish view on the Indian Ocean and now the Jakarta follies have discredited Australia in the eyes of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to look at the joint communique issued at the conclusion of the Australian Prime Minister’s visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> and to see just one of the significant events that was concluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is in the context of the future strength and stability of South East Asia that I also attach considerable importance to <span class="highlight">China</span>’s statement that it will not permit its relations with foreign communist parties to interfere with its foreign policy relations on a state to state basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For many years the Australian wheat industry suffered because of the policies adopted by honourable members opposite in that they refused to recognise that there was a big market for our wheat in mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although <span class="highlight">China</span> did come to us early in the piece Canada beat us to that market to the extent that we were practically frozen out until late 1972 when the Chinese, because of their needs, decided to come back to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During that visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> Ivor Greenwood and I, together with other members of the delegation, had many serious lengthy discussions with the leaders of the Chinese people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one considers the programs for the development of nuclear energy, and even the testing of nuclear weapons, in the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, for example, one must say that that country does not appear to have been terribly concerned about its own people living within the area of Lop Nor and in the northern sections of Mongolia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In any case, for a very long time into the future, <span class="highlight">China</span> certainly will not be any threat to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Having visited the country recently, I can assure honourable members that one comes away with the enormously overpowering impression that <span class="highlight">China</span> will be altogether too preoccupied with her own domestic industrial development to consider those sorts of ventures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">China</span> one can understand that the real problem of <span class="highlight">China</span> is its own internal management, the capacity to feed its 850 million people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can understand that those people had in mind the preservation of their country, dedication to their <span class="highlight">China</span>, an ability to overthrow a regime which was not working in their interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One meets people in <span class="highlight">China</span> who can tell, for example, of the famines of the 1 930s when they lost their parents and their brothers and sisters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The most important aspect of <span class="highlight">China</span> today is the ability to organise itself into land communes, basically on a food basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> is not interested in expansion, and it is a complete anomaly to suggest that it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this is even more important at the present time when what is happening in <span class="highlight">China</span> is extremely debatable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a pity that the Government has not seen fit, even in response to some Dorothy Dix questions, to give some information as to what is actually happening in <span class="highlight">China</span> at the present time but I suppose the Government has very little information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I noticed a news item in today’s Melbourne  Herald  suggesting that the Soviet Union has threatened to intervene in <span class="highlight">China</span> at a time when the Chinese leadership is not at its strongest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have had the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund but at least with the Asian Development Bank we endeavour to provide assistance on what are called soft terms or less than normal market rates of interest to areas adjacent to Australia, fdo not think that we always realise that Indonesia has more than 100 million people, that Japan has more than 100 million people, that India has something like 700 million to 800 million people taking into account various other areas, and that <span class="highlight">China</span> has 800 million people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does any honourable member seriously believe that India is going to invade this country or that <span class="highlight">China</span> does not have enough on its hands in looking after its own internal problems? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister has sent the following message to <span class="highlight">China</span>’s  Chairman,  Hua Kuo-feng. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The handout of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to the Press stated quite clearly that a message was addressed to  Mr Hua  on the basis of his being the  Chairman  of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of <span class="highlight">China</span> in Peking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have sought to improve Australian-Chinese relations not merely for bilateral contact but because we believe strongly in the desirability of <span class="highlight">China</span> being better integrated into the international system of diplomatic communications and discussions than it has been to date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The editorial refers to certain remarks which were alleged to have been made in relation to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have requested evidence for oft quoted principles in relation to our <span class="highlight">China</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 2 principles for which I seek evidence are these: It has been stated that <span class="highlight">China</span> has a policy now of promoting stability in South East Asia which is similar to our policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware that <span class="highlight">China</span> is responsible for promoting insurgency there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the face of that evidence I merely request evidence for the principle that <span class="highlight">China</span>’s policy is related to a similar view held by Australians or others on stability in South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point with which I want to deal in the few minutes available to me is this: I refer to the non-interference principle which has been promoted by <span class="highlight">China</span> and accepted by the  Age  in a number of its comments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The non-interference principle has been that <span class="highlight">China</span> has said: ‘We will let government to government relations be quite separate and distinct from party to party relations’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That principle has been quoted over and over again and it is then presumed to represent a new era of peace and goodwill in South East Asia for which <span class="highlight">China</span> has a predominate, searching and apparently a sincere role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I listened to broadcasts which are made continually from southern <span class="highlight">China</span> promoting insurgency I wonder whether the  Age  and other journals are aware of the fact that the activities of the Communist Party in <span class="highlight">China</span>  visavis  Communist parties in other parts of the world are distinct from attitudes between the Chinese Government and other governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that principle is stated without anyone seeking evidence for it, all it does is merely allow <span class="highlight">China</span> a free hand through insurgency movements to promote instability in South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over the next 10-15 years the world could become a lawless place with the United States alliance breaking down and conflict between Russia and America with <span class="highlight">China</span> being dragged in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the previous Government made a grave error and sold out our position to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> when it simply agreed to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span> and to dismiss the presence of Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The threat to Australia presented by the speakers varied between the ebb and flow of international politics, as suggested by  Sir Arthur  Tange, in contrast to the clear conviction by Brigadier F.

    <p>Is it a fact that an Australian citizen, Miss Susan Day, presently employed by the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> as a teacher, has applied to the Chinese authorities for permission to marry a Chinese citizen? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The projection was centred on those longitudes that cover <span class="highlight">China</span> and which, of course, include Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One wonders what those students of the English language in <span class="highlight">China</span> conclude when they see their country with 900 million people, a quarter of the world’s population, and they compare it to Australia, a country of somewhat similar size with 13 million people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am astonished sometimes when I hear people talking with great adulation now about the sale of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> and beef to Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at overall events that have taken place in the world I put the proposition that to a large extent what happens is influenced by the fact that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and <span class="highlight">China</span> are in conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union had a common policy, as they did up till about 1958, 1 think that it would be extremely difficult for the United States and for countries associated with the United Statesthe democratic countries of the world- to stand up to pressure from the 2 communist super powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia was lucky, the world was lucky and those of us who believe in individual freedom were lucky that a split occurred between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia after 1958. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important for us that there is competition between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the U.S.S.R. in the so-called Third World. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span> are both totalitarian countries completely opposed to what we stand for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only basis on which I would think it would be reasonable to support <span class="highlight">China</span>  vis-a-vis  the Soviet Union is that the Chinese appear to be weaker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important from our point of view that these 2 countries should be kept from confronting one another and that the point should not be reached where, as the Chinese would put it, there would be absolute hegemony on the part of the U.S.S.R. vi’savis <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None of this happens in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The author is one of the few critics to visit <span class="highlight">China</span> who has reported some criticisms when leaving that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After making the point that <span class="highlight">China</span> is a weak country militarily compared with the Soviet Union he went on to state: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor is there anything to suggest that <span class="highlight">China</span> will become a superpower in 10, 20, or even 30 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage I would like to move away from the conflict between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia and deal with the Indonesian situation and some of the problems that arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the sort of thing I would expect to happen in <span class="highlight">China</span> but not in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, in discussing <span class="highlight">China</span> he refers to the need for modest processes and progress in developing our relationship ‘rather than spectacular gestures’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He does not recollect -or more likely prefers to forget- the spectacular thud of the sortie of his Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  into Sino-Australian relations in <span class="highlight">China</span> a little over 8 months ago when the Prime Minister proposed a 4-power alliance, including clumsily aligning himself with the Chinese on a fairly sensitive issue which the Japanese were trying to handle delicately; questioned the future security of Malaysia and Singapore; raised doubts about the stability of the Indonesian Government; and challenged India’s sincerity in its concern for world peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was interested to hear his comments on the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and his description of those nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said, however, that he thought it was of great international significance that the conflict between the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union should continue, the inference being, of course, that were there to be established between the Government of Peking and the Government of Moscow a rapport and an understanding the probability would be that there would be a greater threat in the world because those 2 governments would be so powerful- in truth, two super-powers combined- that the rest of the world would need to tremble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I doubt very much that there is any real basic animosity between the people who live in Western Europe and the Soviet Union and the people who live in the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in the south. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are there obviously because the Russians believe that there is a threat from the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I shall spell them out for the honourable member: The initiatives in regard to Japan, the recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>, the withdrawal from Vietnam and the recognition of Vietnam, and the normalisation of relations with those neighbours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberals had been wrong about Indonesia, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, South Africa, Rhodesia and New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During my 8 years in the House there have been numerous debates on South East Asia, Timor, South Africa, Rhodesia, Russia, <span class="highlight">China</span> and a host of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me take another example- communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a complete contradiction between the way they treat these things in <span class="highlight">China</span> and the way they use them to deceive us here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be visits to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people, well-meaning as they are, will come back from <span class="highlight">China</span> giving us the version of things there which the Chinese communist authorities want to put over to us- a version which is a lie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are going to use these wellmeaning people, to encourage them to go to <span class="highlight">China</span> and to come back and propagate a lie with all the authority of returned tourists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his remarks about the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> I do not know whether he is attacking purely this side of the Parliament or whether he is attacking both this side of the Parliament and his own side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without a doubt, if one were to accept the remarks which he made, one would realise very obviously that they were directed as well to members of his side of the Parliament who have visited <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a pity- a tragedy, in fact- for future relations between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone must remember that there are 800 million people in <span class="highlight">China</span> and that <span class="highlight">China</span> forms a very great part of Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of very great importance for Australia to understand <span class="highlight">China</span> and for <span class="highlight">China</span> to understand Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason I think it may be a great pity indeed that the honourable member for Mackellar has not had an opportunity to visit <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, I can recall speaking to Embassy officials in Peking after a visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> by a delegation from this Parliament during the term of the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The officials said that he gained a good deal from the visit; that he went to <span class="highlight">China</span> with a lack of understanding as to what was really happening there and he came away with a far greater understanding, particularly of the need for the 2 countries to work together to understand one another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet he went to <span class="highlight">China</span> and he came back with a greater understanding of <span class="highlight">China</span> than he had previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall one night during an adjournment debate in this place bringing forward some  Hansard  quotes in which the honourable member had suggested military action against <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, <span class="highlight">China</span> represents 800 million people in Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, I believe, very important that we should get to know and understand <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> is one of the oldest civilisations in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that one of the great pluses of the Whitlam era during the period leading up to the election of the Labor Government in 1972 and during the period of its term of office from 1972 to 1 975 was that we were able to get rid of the isolation of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said he had just come from <span class="highlight">China</span> and he made the point then that he was very deeply concerned about the ignorance at that point of time of the leadership of <span class="highlight">China</span> about what was happening in the world outside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He felt that the ignorance was dangerous and that it was very very important to involve <span class="highlight">China</span> in the councils of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fortunately, that is what the Labor Party realised in that year of 1954 when it first adopted as its policy at the Hobart Conference that not only should <span class="highlight">China</span> be given diplomatic recognition but also that she should be admitted to the United Nations, to the councils of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That policy received a great fillip from the visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> in 1972 by the then Leader of the Opposition  Mr Whitlam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course upon the election of a Labor Government in 1972 there was recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span> by Australia, and not that long after the admission of <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations, to the councils of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe this was a step towards achieving greater international understanding not only between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span> but also between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret very greatly that there are people who have completely closed their minds to the need to get this understanding between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Australia in particular and between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It says that <span class="highlight">China</span> was seen as the most likely invader. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has been to <span class="highlight">China</span> and his attitudes are in direct contravention of the attitudes expressed by the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The movements in Asia, Africa and indeed most parts of the world- in <span class="highlight">China</span> it was the Long March- were all part of nationalist movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the 1960s the people of the world- the people of the greater nations and the lesser nations- whose governments had involved them in a warlike operation in the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> region questioned the wisdom of this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the land war in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> came to a close. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I applaud this Government for establishing a real and workable basis for relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now have as a direct result of the highly successful visit of the Prime Minister to <span class="highlight">China</span> a working relationship with the Chinese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provided they remain non-aggressive I believe that Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span> can have strong friendship bonds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that at the moment, rightly or wrongly, I believe that <span class="highlight">China</span> wants peaceful co-existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But then, when speaking about <span class="highlight">China</span>, he went on to kill his good speech and his image by such references as ‘the sham pantomime working relationship of the previous Government’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the honourable member used the words ‘sham pantomime’ in respect of the Labor Party’s policy on <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He knows too well, through his superior intellect and training, the benefits of great schooling and the position he holds as a barrister at law that for years it was Labor Party policy that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> should be admitted to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He knew for years that if the Labor Party got into power it would immediately recognise the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I remember that after I came to this House in 1 960 abuse was levelled against the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> by the Conservatives and the Tories of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My old friend the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth),  whom I respect in many ways and who has just come into this chamber, at one time suggested that Australia should use its influence to drop an atomic bomb on the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Children born in <span class="highlight">China</span> had to be sold by the pound in the streets by their mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They lost thousands of lives in fighting for a new social order, for which we should have applauded them from the day the members of the Mao Tse-tung Government became the people in charge of People’s <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Kooyong, the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock),  in his speech on foreign policy which we are now debating in this House, 1 1 times in 10 minutes very courteously used the expression ‘<span class="highlight">China</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact what it says is that we will be watching the situation carefully following the assurances given and the interpretation placed upon them by the previous Australian Ambassador to <span class="highlight">China</span> and accepted by the present Government as a significant change in the attitude of the Chinese Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One cannot blame the more recent nonrecognition of Taiwan in favour of recognition of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> as the reason for these intrusions, although I am personally sorry to have seen Taiwan sacrificed in the power moves of years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless the experience of the past few years, not only for Australia but also for governments throughout the Western world and the centralised economies of eastern Europe, <span class="highlight">China</span> and so forth, have been that we must get together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is there any concern or even hope that guarantees given with the new American policy will differ totally in their effect from the guarantees given to <span class="highlight">China</span> from 1946 to 1948 and to South Vietnam from 1972 to 1975? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to implications with respect to the American attitude to <span class="highlight">China</span>, one can only say that in the progressive integration of <span class="highlight">China</span> into the world in recent times there seems to have been a significant change in what was previously seen as a continuing aggressive policy towards the border states of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do they want to go on with this sort of nonsense because the title of the document includes the words ‘Little Red Book’, and they think that it has some connotation with <span class="highlight">China</span> or something of that nature? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For example, the message should be made even clearer to uranium buyers that any nuclear explosion set off by countries other than the recognised nuclear powers- that is, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, <span class="highlight">China</span> and France- will result in immediate and permanent cessation of uranium supplies from Canada, Australia and the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There seems no reason, however, for Australia to contemplate selling uranium to any present nonsignatories of the NPT, although loopholes exist in the new policy for both France and <span class="highlight">China</span>, while new safeguards for other non-signatories are foreshadowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand, one must admit that there has been no attempt to conceal that this was the very fear in the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>ASEAN enjoys at this time only a small share of Australia’s imports of textiles, apparel and footwearunder 10 per cent of the value of such imports from Korea, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Hong Kong and Taiwan combined- and clearly there is room for improvement in this share so far as ASEAN is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In relation to the old India-<span class="highlight">China</span> conflict of 1962, a passing reference was made to the annexation of part of Indian territory by <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The principle which has been quite clear in determining the policy of both the Australian Labor Party and of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition with respect to a whole series of countries, such as Russia, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Vietnam, Cambodia, and India, has not applied in relation to Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a number of years some of those assessments were quite outrageously wrong, not the least of which was our political assessment of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That could not really have been deemed a threat to this nation but we based the whole of our defence structure on the assessment that there would be a downward thrust by <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point I am making is that this led to the Vietnam situation as it was thought that <span class="highlight">China</span> must be contained through Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I also take to task the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  for taunting honourable members on this side- particularly the honourable member for St George  (Mr Neil)-  for continually parroting the phrase the downward thrust of <span class="highlight">China</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith might be concerned about the downward thrust of <span class="highlight">China</span>, but what everyone should be worried about is the downward thrust of communism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is so much greater than any other nuclear danger that in comparison the others are really not worth talking about I remind the House that countries such as France, Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, South Africa and Israel, which are now believed to have nuclear weapons capacity, did not get that capacity in any way through nuclear power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The official Government attitude towards <span class="highlight">China</span>, the USSR, Vietnam and Cambodia has been stated in the Parliament on various occasions by the Prime Minister and by me, including in my ministerial statement of 1 5 March 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-68">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1239, when have there been evident different policies and practices enunciated by the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Communist Party of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-129">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1239 carried no implications with regard to the matter of whether or not there are differences between the policies and practices enunciated by the Government of the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Communist Party of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-129">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The assurance given to the Prime Minister when he visited <span class="highlight">China</span> last year is a matter of public record and is best assessed by examining <span class="highlight">China</span>’s record in the area of foreign policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-129">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>and (5) I draw the honourable member’s attention to my address to the Deepdene Branch of the Liberal Party on 9 August 1976 in which I outlined the Government’s longstanding and continuing concern about this matter, and in which I commented on the assurances given to the Prime Minister during his visit to <span class="highlight">China</span>- ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-129">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I now wish to discuss a short visit I made to <span class="highlight">China</span> recently because that country has had some problems with the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe he was right when he sent  Dr Fitzgerald  as the first Ambassador to the Peoples Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and to open negotiations between our country and the Chinese people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What progress are we making in <span class="highlight">China</span> at the present time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1955 I had the opportunity to visit <span class="highlight">China</span> with the first parliamentary delegation from the United Kingdom, which was drawn from the House of Commons and the House of Lords. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We travelled to <span class="highlight">China</span> because back bench members decided that there would be a visit of members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We went to <span class="highlight">China</span> to see whether the <span class="highlight">China</span> that was developing would be of any consequence in world affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I arrived in Paris I spoke to a French ambassador who said that any person who thinks that he speaks with authority on international affairs and discards <span class="highlight">China</span> does not understand the balance of power in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He suggested that the two great factors in the world economy will be the European Common Market and the balance of power between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On returning to <span class="highlight">China</span> after 20 years, what were the main changes that I noted? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first thing was that one realised that the Peoples Army runs <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everywhere one travelled one could not be other than impressed with the tremendous impact that the army has had on <span class="highlight">China</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">China</span> we are regarded as imbeciles; we do not understand world power; we have not comprehended the power of the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">China</span> I walked into a shop with my guides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The balance of power between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Japan is important to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must never overlook what friendship, what guidance and what else we may receive by co-operating with <span class="highlight">China</span> in the world in the years ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>America and Australia might recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the nature of the links of the Australian Government with Taiwan completely acceptable to <span class="highlight">China</span>, that is, to Peking? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, has the Government considered pursuing a less rigid and exclusive approach to Taiwan than it is claimed is presently required due to the nature of our diplomatic accord with <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that the relationship between this Government and the Government of <span class="highlight">China</span> has developed very extensively as a result of the personal visit of the present Prime Minister as well as other visits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Relationships between the United States and <span class="highlight">China</span> are somewhat different in many respects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the bases by which our relationship with <span class="highlight">China</span> have developed are in the mutual interests of our countries and I see little reason to move away from them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Come to <span class="highlight">China</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was an advertisement for people to travel to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should stop the hypocrisy of its assault on European Economic Community trade barriers and exploit the opportunities which exist for rural sales to expanding markets like <span class="highlight">China</span>, Vietnam and the Middle East. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But for the much grander design which the Prime Minister has in mind for these regional meetings, one cannot ignore the handicap of not having represented at them such major forces in the region as Indonesia, Japan, <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In line with the policy of successive Australian governments since recognition of the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> on 21 December 1972, passports issued by the regime on Taiwan are not accepted as travel documents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-37">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has his attention been drawn to the statement by  Mr Liao  Cheng-chin, a member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, made in Peking on 28 February 1978, that the United States of America should sever its diplomatic and military links with the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-15">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the Australian Government pursued relations with the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in a manner completely acceptable to the Chinese Peoples’ Republic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If not, what actions concerning diplomatic relations with the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> has the Australian Government pursued which are not completely and totally acceptable to the Chinese Peoples’ Republic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can he say whether the United States of America and Canada require the same guarantees of a person visiting their countries from the republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> as are required by Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Australian Government since 1973 discussed with the Government of the Chinese Peoples’ Republic any softening of its rigid attitude towards the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>; if so, when did these discussions take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(2), (3) and (3) Australia on 21 December 1972 recognised the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> as the sole legal government of <span class="highlight">China</span> and acknowledged the position of the Chinese Government that Taiwan is a province of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Canada, like Australia, recognises the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(6 and (7) The People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> maintains that Taiwan is a province of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The regime on Taiwan purports to be the government of the whole of <span class="highlight">China</span> of which Taiwan is a province. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the Minister for Foreign Affairs seen the three comments made by the first Australian Ambassador to <span class="highlight">China</span> in his lectures and in his book, subsequent to his return to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, that we- that is, Australia- lack the mechanisms for consultation with <span class="highlight">China</span>, or even fear <span class="highlight">China</span> as a threat to our allegedly free enterprise system; secondly, that in spite of undertakings on trade we imposed import restrictions in a manner which ultimately damaged credibility; and, thirdly, that on at least two matters Australia is rudely offhand when ‘it comes to <span class="highlight">China</span>’s major exports to Australia’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is an implication that there is a problem in our relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, I reject it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will go no further than saying that since this Government came to power the movement in relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> has been most significant in regard both to the cultural agreements that we have discussed and to family reunion, consular agreements and other matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will be wanting  Dr Fitzgerald  to head up an Australia-<span class="highlight">China</span> foundation- I have indicated that elsewhereand the Government will be giving consideration to the membership of that body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He was answering a question from  Mr K.  Cairns (Lib, Qld) who said that  Dr Stephen  Fitzgerald, former Australian Ambassador to <span class="highlight">China</span>, had remarked that Australia saw <span class="highlight">China</span> as a threat to the free enterprise system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question which I put was substantially different from that, and the point I made in relation to the remarks of the former Ambassador to <span class="highlight">China</span> and his return to Australia was different from that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the communique signed in December 1972 by Australia and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> remain the basis on which that relationship should be conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was the reference by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Australia-Taiwan relationship during Question Time on 7 March 1978 in terms of existing opportunities for an exchange of points of view between citizens of our respective countries consistent with the status which Taiwan was accorded in that communique; if not, does the remark indicate that the Acting Minister appeared to be taking advantage of his absence to nudge Australia back in the direction of a ‘two <span class="highlight">China</span>’ policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my colleague the Minister for Primary Industry noted during question time on 7 March 1978, the principles upon which our relationship with <span class="highlight">China</span> have been based serve the mutual interests of our two countries and the Government has no intention of attempting to change the basis of the relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Now that, through the withdrawal of the United States and the inactivity of <span class="highlight">China</span>, only 8 out of a possible 10 Members of ILO are classified by its Governing Body as being those of chief industrial importance, what steps have been or are being taken to secure the recognition of Australia as one of the 10. f <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which I direct to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, refers to an announcement he made the other day in answer to a question that the former Ambassador to <span class="highlight">China</span> is likely to head an Australia-<span class="highlight">China</span> foundation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister know that the former Ambassador has repeatedly stated- a statement with which I agree- that an awareness of the Chinese view of the world is essential to any process of conducting negotiations with or seeking to understand <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, does the Minister consider that these are appropriate stances to take in an objective, disinterested post which the position of  chairman  of the Australia-<span class="highlight">China</span> foundation should be? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>India’s record, in fact, is one of peace, although India was assailed many years ago from across its northern borders by the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He did not see fit to make any reference to the development of the industry in the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noted only the other day in the newspapers that a distinguished serviceman of the United Kingdom was making statements in Peking which appeared to be acceptable to his hosts, to the effect that having regard to the threat of a nuclear war the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the United Kingdom should be seen as standing side by side against a potential adversary which he went on to name as the USSR. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went to <span class="highlight">China</span> and established diplomatic recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span> and diplomatic relations between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Australia for the first time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are glad to see the continued growth of the relationship with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, for which the basis was laid with a communique signed on 21 December 1972, less than three weeks after Labor took office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We established relations with the real government of <span class="highlight">China</span>; we took matching steps to improve communications with Moscow; we recognised the existing governments in North Vietnam and North Korea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fraser Government has not backed away from diplomatic relations with these countries, but it has upset the balance of our relations with the U.S.S.R. and <span class="highlight">China</span> because of the Prime Minister’s anti-Soviet inclination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having behaved like the proverbial bull in the <span class="highlight">china</span> shop, the Prime Minister claimed the next day that his tough line had produced an immediate response, and therefore there would be a meeting in June. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, that is one of the reasons the Minister for Industry and Commerce  (Mr Lynch)  went to <span class="highlight">China</span> in the last week or so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what the trip to <span class="highlight">China</span> was all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has already been assured by the Chinese Government that <span class="highlight">China</span> will be prepared to take substantially increased quantities of Australian iron ore which will to a large degree offset the loss of iron ore exports to Japan because of the cutback in intake by the Japanese steel mills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the Minister on what he has managed to achieve in <span class="highlight">China</span> in the last week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I concede that Labor recognised <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what the visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> was all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I particularly note its attitude to the Common Fund, the Commonwealth Conference, the Australia- Japan Foundation and the negotiations at present in progress with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am happy to say in response to the question posed by the honourable gentleman that my recent visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> did open up substantial new trade opportunities for Australia in raw materials and industrial equipment as well as in technology and expertise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These opportunities derive directly from <span class="highlight">China</span>’s new plans for economic modernisation and in addition reflect the strengthening of political and economic ties between our two countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">China</span> I received top level assurance that as long as prices are competitive <span class="highlight">China</span> will import considerably larger quantities of iron ore from Australia to underpin the very rapid expansion in steel output which is planned up to and including 1985. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general discussions with Chinese leaders I emphasised that apart from Australia’s natural resources we have technologies and equipment which are well suited to <span class="highlight">China</span>’s needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the course of the next few weeks I shall be following up the matters which I canvassed during my visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> with industry leaders in Australia and also with ministerial colleagues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am of the view that he is not suited to hold the first appointment as  Chairman  of the AustraliaChina Foundation, for five reasons, not the least important of which is that he has come desperately close in his own views not only to saying that Australians should understand the Chinese view of the world but also that Australia should support the Chinese view of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the time of the Han dynasty there has been the tradition of the kow-tow in respect of other nations’ rulers who go to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The modern version of that has been that <span class="highlight">China</span> has regarded both super powers as being equally objectionable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would leave <span class="highlight">China</span> as the leader of the Third World. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most notable statement whereby he comes close to supporting the Chinese view of the world as his own view is found at page 18 of his book  <span class="highlight">China</span> and the World. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not support the proposition that the  chairman  of an Australia-<span class="highlight">China</span> Foundation should equate the United States of America with Soviet Russia in terms of the reprehensibility of their external behaviour and I hope that nobody on this side of the chamber would do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He repeats, in terms of American relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>, the proposition that America for 1 7 years refused to have such relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What he forgets is that from 1950 to 1954 it was impossible to have relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> on her own term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From 1955 there was an agreement between the United States and <span class="highlight">China</span> in terms of the repatriation of persons, which <span class="highlight">China</span> did not uphold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only period during the 1 7 years in which it was possible to have the relations which  Dr Fitzgerald  proposes, in accordance with <span class="highlight">China</span>’s point of” view, was from 1956 to 1957, after which there was an anti-rightist coup which was in fact promoted by Mao Tse-tung. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under present circumstances, that has operated merely as a cover for <span class="highlight">China</span> to promote her own revolutionary movements in Malaysia, in Thailand and, in particular, in Burma. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of the fifth point, I refer to page 105 of his book, in which he casts serious doubt on whether a private enterprise system such as that of Australia can by its very nature negotiate trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some rather undergraduatish comments upon the nature of our system, but under those circumstances I say without hesitation or reservation that  Dr Fitzgerald  has insufficient judgment, insufficient understanding and insufficient balance to fill this most important position- one of very great prestigeas the first  chairman,  recommended by the Government, of the Australia-<span class="highlight">China</span> Foundation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would do Australia no good and it would certainly give <span class="highlight">China</span> a misunderstanding of what Australia’s point of view of the world ought to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interests of this country he performed a great service as Australia’s first Ambassador to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time the Labor Government, in accordance with its policy, initiated the action which brought about the exchange of diplomatic representation between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span> there was no man in Australia with such a great depth of knowledge of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts are these: <span class="highlight">China</span> has 25 per cent of the world ‘s population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is ridiculous to suggest that <span class="highlight">China</span> should be kept in isolation from the rest of the world and not be brought into the councils of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is ridiculous for anyone to oppose the idea that <span class="highlight">China</span> should get to understand the attitudes of other countries and that other countries, including Australia, should get to understand the attitudes of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That must be true because, if there is going to be advancement within the nations that constitute our region, if there is going to be advancement in the economies of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, Japan, the Philippines, and those other countries to which I have referred, it will be in the manufacturing area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, the attitude to <span class="highlight">China</span> of honourable members opposite has changed dramatically in the last three or four years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think one of the greatest signs of hope around the country is the total change in the attitude to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Six or seven years ago- m fact, up until five years agohonourable members on the Government side would not even recognise the existence of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are all keen to be friends with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a long-held attitude to a country such as <span class="highlight">China</span> can change as dramatically as that, we can change our attitudes to the rest of the world by applying ourselves to these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-<span class="highlight">China</span> is already a very important market for Australian iron ore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I read in the reports of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who has just recently been to <span class="highlight">China</span>, that <span class="highlight">China</span> is anticipating increasing its steel production to something like 60 million tonnes of crude steel by the middle of the 1980s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Japanese will be constructing some of the new blast furnaces in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those representatives pointed to the fact that, with the increasing steelmaking capacity of <span class="highlight">China</span>, Australia could be looking to that market for additional sales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that at a time when the world market for iron ore is difficult it is very encouraging to have the opportunity of increasing our sales to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both countries have a high stake in the security and prosperity of other economically advanced democratic powers in the world; in the continuation of the process of detente between the super-powers; in maintaining an open and nondiscriminatory regime in international trade; in encouraging a continuing United States presence in the Asia-Pacific region to the extent necessary to maintain a sound balance in that region; in opposing any attempt by the Soviet Union- or any other major power- to establish hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region; and in encouraging <span class="highlight">China</span> to continue to play a constructive role in regional affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But five short years ago, this Parliament did not recognise the existence of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suddenly the gates to <span class="highlight">China</span> have been opened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the sort of thing he was saying on his return from <span class="highlight">China</span> and it points up the stark difference between the ideologies of those in the Government parties and those on this side of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I applaud what  Mr Huang  Hua, the Foreign Minister of <span class="highlight">China</span>, has said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It rejects out of hand what <span class="highlight">China</span> is saying and it rejects, of course, what the United States is saying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This comes from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who was a senior Minister in a government which, for example, in negotiating the Accords with Peking <span class="highlight">China</span> negotiated the most stringent and strict Accords that have been applied by any Western nation according recognition to Peking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780606_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia, and in the short term, where we have provided a lead to other countries in our attitude towards the problems of the unfortunate people in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, is such that we as a nation can be very proud of the fact that we have demonstrated in a positive and tangible way an attitude that can provide an example for other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I mentioned in the House and on a number of other occasions, there are very strong prospects for additional exports to <span class="highlight">China</span> which is now a very significant market for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In response to what the honourable gentleman has said I can say that <span class="highlight">China</span> is a significant market for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That will be followed later in the year by Australia’s involvement in an agricultural exhibition in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-For a few moments this evening I would like to refer to Australia’s relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Ambassador of the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>,  Mr Chou  Chiu-yeh, for inviting me and my wife to go to <span class="highlight">China</span> and spend 10 days in that country observing the changes that have taken place there over the last 10 or 20 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1956 I went to <span class="highlight">China</span> with the first mission of both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I was in a good position to be  able to observe the changes that have occurred in <span class="highlight">China</span> over a number of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remarkable changes have been made in the petrochemical industry and in many other manufacturing industries in <span class="highlight">China</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was interesting to see how seriously <span class="highlight">China</span> takes defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My wife and I were taken for a walk for two and a half miles under the city of Peking to observe and see at first hand <span class="highlight">China</span> ‘s defence in the event of a nuclear war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was impressed too with the view of leading experts in international affairs in <span class="highlight">China</span> when they said that the Western world today does not appreciate the threat posed by the Soviet Union through its activities in Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore very good news that recently at the United Nations <span class="highlight">China</span> decided that she too should be consulted about the changing pattern of world events. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any country in the world which thinks it can conduct foreign affairs without consulting the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is indeed making a mistake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can do nothing but congratulate the Chinese People’s Government in realising that they are now anxious to establish themselves, to work with the rest of the world and to improve <span class="highlight">China</span>’s technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can be proud of our relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>VISIT TO <span class="highlight">CHINA</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The visit which I made to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> between 25 April and 4 May had two main purposes- to maintain and develop contact and communication between the Australian and Chinese Governments, and to explore the prospects of increasing and diversifying an economic relationship which is highly important to both our countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The good political relationship which has been developed between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Australia has under-pinned a substantial growth in trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is now <span class="highlight">China</span>’s fourth largest trading partner and <span class="highlight">China</span> was Australia’s fifth largest export market in 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed in 1977 <span class="highlight">China</span> sent more high level visitors to Australia than went from here to Peking- an unprecedented development in our relations and an unusual fact in <span class="highlight">China</span>’s relations with any country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chinese Government is aware, as a result of my visit, that the Australian Government had noted the significance of Chinese high level visits to Australia in 1977 and fully reciprocates <span class="highlight">China</span>’s interest in the maintenance of contact and dialogue at a high level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> sees global balance and regional stability as being in its interests because it is seeking to direct the energies and talents of its vast population into the monumental tasks of modernisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite its great achievements the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is very aware that it is still a developing society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The timing of my visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> was connected with the plans for <span class="highlight">China</span>’s modernisation which were announced by Premier Hua Kuo-Feng in his report on the Government to the National People’s Congress on 26 February. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This statement has not attracted the attention it deserved in Australia and should be the starting point for examination of our future relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> and the opportunities open for developing them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Premier Hua Kuo-Feng announced that <span class="highlight">China</span> has embarked on programs which aim to take it to the forefront of world economies by the turn of the century and he announced with some specificity ambitious targets to be achieved by 1985. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, as I have already described it in <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Chinese have now embarked on their second long march. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">China</span> succeeds in the aims it has set for itself for modernisation, or makes substantial progress along this road, the implications will be significant for the world and for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The program and the policies of Premier Hua Huo-Feng’s Government have opened up new opportunities for the development of closer relations between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Australia at the government level, at the commercial level, and in the highly important area of technical exchange. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has already indicated in practical ways its wish to strengthen links with <span class="highlight">China</span> by encouraging people to people contacts through its cultural exchange programs and, most recently, by its decision to establish the Australia-<span class="highlight">China</span> Council, by financial support of scientific exchanges and by taking the initiative in arranging with <span class="highlight">China</span> programs of potentially great importance to both countries to exchange experience and expertise in the fields of agriculture and minerals production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I received assurances at the top level from those directly concerned in both Peking and Shanghai that as long as prices are competitive, <span class="highlight">China</span> will import considerably larger quantities of iron ore on a long term basis from Australia, which it looks to as its main supplier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> will require significantly increased quantities of iron ore to meet its steel production targets and has indicated that Australian ores are suitable for blending with domestically produced ores. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> is an important market for Australian iron and steel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was assured by Chinese authorities that although <span class="highlight">China</span> planned to rapidly increase its own production of steel the planned rate of production would be insufficient to meet their needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from iron ore and steel I discussed the possibility of the export to <span class="highlight">China</span> of other Australian minerals and nonferrous metals, including aluminium, copper, lead, zinc, nickel and mineral sands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> also opened up prospects for Australian industry in new fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> is interested in acquiring advanced mineral and metallurgical technology and in developing its infrastructure to support its modernisation program, in this regard Australian techniques in the extraction of minerals, their transport from the mine and the construction of deep harbours are of direct relevance to <span class="highlight">China</span> ‘s conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am confident that much Australian technology is suitable for <span class="highlight">China</span>’s conditions and requirements, an obvious example being our agricultural machinery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this context it is relevant that <span class="highlight">China</span>’s agricultural modernisation objectives include: achievement of 85 per cent mechanisation in all major processes of farm work by 1 985 a four to five per cent annual increase in agricultural output over the next eight years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia manufactures a full range of agricultural equipment and it was indicated to me that there are good prospects for use of Australian technology and equipment in the further mechanisation of <span class="highlight">China</span> ‘s agriculture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Plans are also under way for an early exchange of missions between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Australia which will initiate an ongoing program of exchanges of agricultural expertise and information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a remarkable fact that Australia ranks second only to Japan in the number of tourists visiting <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Around 4,000 Australians visited <span class="highlight">China</span> last year and I was informed that some 10,000 will be visiting <span class="highlight">China</span> in 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> has an overall plan for tourist numbers including quotas for individual countries, and the very significant increase in the number of Australians visiting <span class="highlight">China</span> reflects the importance <span class="highlight">China</span> attaches to our bilateral relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The possible involvement of Qantas in servicing the big increase in tourist traffic to <span class="highlight">China</span> was discussed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, our teachers and students in <span class="highlight">China</span> on government exchange programs, some of whom I met, and over 20 teachers directly recruited by the Chinese authorities, are making an important contribution to better understanding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My first task on my return will be to report to my colleagues on my discussions in <span class="highlight">China</span> so that appropriate consideration can be given to follow up action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will also consult with industry in order to ensure that industry leaders are fully aware of the significance of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s long term plans for modernisation and of the opportunities and challenges for participation by Australian industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The potential for increased trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>, combined with the recently announced arrangements for expanded export incentives should provide a stimulus to business expansion in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is appropriate that I should put on record in Australia as I have expressed directly to my Chinese hosts, my appreciation of the warm reception which I received in <span class="highlight">China</span> ‘s three major cities and of the positive and practical approach taken by Chinese leaders in all my discussions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I return from my visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> with a heightened awareness of the scope which exists for the further development of Sino-Australian relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to that unsettling factor, we have the fact that the move would inevitably tend to push Vietnam towards closer and closer links with the Soviet union in contradistinction with its relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its values are largely obsolete and its vision of Australia as an outpost of Empire, tied to the United States alone in this region and resisting contact and cultural exchange with our neighbours in <span class="highlight">China</span>, Japan or Indonesia, seems dangerously anachronistic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On one occasion on a visit to Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span> the former Prime Minister took 53 people with him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780816_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet he has made no criticism of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that if there are two classic illustrations of the great socialist state, they would be the USSR and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the bluetongue situation in Australia, the following countries have total bans imposed on the importation of ruminants from Australia: UK, Ireland, USSR, Bulgaria, Romania, German Democratic Republic, Canada, Argentina, Republic of Korea, People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, New Zealand, Fiji and Western Samoa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-47-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Trade and Resources whether he is able to tell the House what results have come from a recent visit to Australia of representatives of the <span class="highlight">China</span> National Metals and Minerals Import and Export Corporation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a mission that I invited to Australia to survey the situation regarding <span class="highlight">China</span>’s requirements for iron ore and other metals and minerals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can say that very substantial sales have been made to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government’s desire to build up our trading relationship with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the new regime came to power a conscious effort has been made to seek technology and raw materials from other countries to help industrial development in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that Australia can play a very significant role in supplying <span class="highlight">China</span> with a good deal of its raw materials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main potential markets are probably <span class="highlight">China</span> and perhaps Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On my recent visit to Japan, <span class="highlight">China</span> and Hong Kong, the aspect that interested me most was the density of population in those countries- the number of people living within a limited space. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">China</span> 800 million to 900 million people use every scrap of available land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note from the Laurie Oakes report of today that the Minister was rebuffed in the Chinese negotiations when he found, much to his surprise, that the prices which had been negotiated by the Japanese had also become the benchmark for negotiations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we do not, before we know where we are we may find that Japan, having lost faith in the American alliance, will have re-armed and sought alliance with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Vietnam is a country which is striving to maintain its independence and freedom from all sides whether it be <span class="highlight">China</span> or the Soviet Union on the one hand or the United States on the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conservative side of politics is similarly shocked by the United States of America and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> supporting Zaire, Somalia and Eritrea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hard to believe that two countries which up until about three years ago were being bombed and devastated by outsiders by complete outsiders as far as Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> was concerned are now bombing and devastating one another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until fairly recently many of us tended to worry about the so-called domino effect of what was happening in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> and feared that authoritarian and communist regimes would take over in Vietnam and spread down to Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no more obvious way to prevent people in those other countries who may have been sympathetic to communism from embracing communism or from devoting themselves to overthrowing the governments in those countries than for them to see what is happening at present in Vietnam and in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> in general. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Did the Minister for Post and Telecommunications hear the radio program  AM  on 10 October in which it was reported that Peter McLullan, President of the Young Lawyers Association of Victoria, and Neil McLean, former national leader of the Australian student movement, broadcast from <span class="highlight">China</span> to Thailand calling for continued communist revolution in Thailand? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not responsible for broadcasting matters in <span class="highlight">China</span> or Thailand, and I did not in fact hear the broadcast to which the honourable member has referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was an agreement signed by representatives of Australia and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> enabling a Chinese Consulate to be opened in Sydney with appropriate rights for Australia to open a Consulate in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-11">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If so, did the Australian representative seek at any time during the negotiations to clarify or renegotiate the 1973 Articles of Agreement governing diplomatic relations between Australia and the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the increasing importance of <span class="highlight">China</span> as a market for Australian products, can the Minister indicate what steps the Government is taking to encourage the development of further trade with this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a week’s time I will be leaving with a mission to visit <span class="highlight">China</span> for a period of one week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This will give these people the opportunity of meeting their counterparts and also becoming involved in the new trading environment that is building up in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These people will be having discussions in <span class="highlight">China</span> and assessing the future prospects for trade in commodities and technology and for developing closer economic ties between the two countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the standing of the businessmen who are coming with me indicates the importance that they and I attach to the mission that is going to <span class="highlight">China</span> and reflects the concern that Australia and this Government are showing in developing the best trade links possible with a country where there is obviously immense potential under its new policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1970s we have done an enormous amount towards working out our relationship with <span class="highlight">China</span>, but it does seem to me that there has been a neglect of the Indian sub-continent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Significantly the new markets that have been found for our primary industry products have been found in nations such as <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I dare say that the honourable member for Swan  (Mr Martyr)  would have terrible reservations about our trading with <span class="highlight">China</span>- the dreaded <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does the honourable member remember when  Mr Whitlam  made his visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> in 1971 the uproar that occurred in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not hear honourable members opposite these days referring to <span class="highlight">China</span> as Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> is one of our big trading partners, and honourable members opposite should thank the Labor Government for developing that market and for making them realise that <span class="highlight">China</span> is not the ogre or the bogeyman depicted for 200 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat, as one travels around one sees that manufacturers are looking overseas, are trying to get exports going again; are begining to see Australia in the context of South East Asia, in the context- as the honourable member for Parramatta so rightly pointed out- of <span class="highlight">China</span>, which represents an enormous market to our north. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not want to detract from the good work that was done by  Mr Whitlam  in going to <span class="highlight">China</span> and opening up that area, or the good commonsense of our leader, Prime Minister Fraser, in following that up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I inform the House that the Minister for Trade and Resources  (Mr Anthony)  left Australia this morning for <span class="highlight">China</span> to have discussions over a wide range of trade matters and to attend Australia’s national day at the Peking Foreign Agricultural Machinery Exhibition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781025_reps_31_hor111/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Now, <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> countries are each in various ways seeking better relations with these countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781025_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have established very good relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781025_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are very mindful of the fact that as far back as 1971 the present Prime Minister said that he was very fearful of the consequences of ever recognising <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781025_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were wrong for a generation on the recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781025_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further possible threat in the future could come from attempts by the Soviet Union to destabilise the South East Asian region in order to encircle or contain <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781025_reps_31_hor111/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This could take place as part of the Soviet Union’s long term quarrel with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781025_reps_31_hor111/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My colleague, the honourable member for St George,  (Mr Neil)  a little while ago drew attention to the growing conflict between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Cambodia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781025_reps_31_hor111/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our nearest neighbours- South Africa, India, <span class="highlight">China</span> and the United States- all have nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781025_reps_31_hor111/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> and the discussions I had there added very substantially to the framework that had been established by the visits of  Mr Whitlam  in 1973, the present Prime Minister in 1976 and other Ministers in recent times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am certain that, as a result of this, there will be a flurry of activity between representatives of industry in Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span> to build up trade between our two countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a few weeks’ time the Australia-<span class="highlight">China</span> business co-operation committee will be leaving for a 17-day visit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Keng Piao, a Vice-Premier of <span class="highlight">China</span>, is expected to come here in the early part of next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While in <span class="highlight">China</span> I also renewed the invitation of the Prime Minister to Premier Hua to visit Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A coal mission will be going to <span class="highlight">China</span> shortly to discuss areas of technical co-operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the whole area of technology will be further explored between the two countries and I have put in hand the possibility of some special technological and science agreement, particularly a technological agreement, with <span class="highlight">China</span> to protect the patent rights of Australian manufacturers and suppliers should they enter arrangements with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to this sort of technology, <span class="highlight">China</span> needs consultancy services, specialised equipment and skilled technicians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, while I was in <span class="highlight">China</span> I took up the question of the ban against Australian wool and livestock because of the outbreak of the blue tongue virus in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that as a result of my discussions and those of  Sir Samuel  Burston with officials, and those of Professor Badger with scientific people, we have a chance of breaking through the ban which has been preventing about $20m of traditional wool trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have suggested that as an interim measure <span class="highlight">China</span> might take wool from the sourthern parts of Australia until Chinese technicians can come here to survey the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the $50m credit line that we have offered through the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, officials of the Bank of <span class="highlight">China</span> will be getting together with officials of EFIC to see how the credit line might be fulfilled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A long queue of countries is anxious to become involved with the modernisation of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> has enormous grassland areas which are virtually undeveloped- there are approximately 200 million hectares of this sort of country- and its development offers opportunities for us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that other Australian States will be able to provide help and get involved in these projects in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With respect to recent trade negotiations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> about the export of iron ore, what arrangements have been made about shipping. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Recent contracts concluded between Australian iron ore producers and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> for the supply of iron ore to <span class="highlight">China</span> were on an fob basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, responsibility for the shipping arrangements lies with the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> approached the Australian Government with a request for Australia to accept greater numbers of Chinese students in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the publicly stated interest of <span class="highlight">China</span> in rapidly expanding numbers of Chinese students studying abroad, what steps has the Government taken to consult with State authorities and tertiary institutions to establish what needs to be done to accept these students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we as members of the Labor Party as long ago as 10 or 15 years advocated the recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> we were told that we were traitors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As recently as three or four years ago, when the then Leader of the Opposition, Gough Whitlam, had been to <span class="highlight">China</span>, and the then Minister for External Affairs sought the right to go to <span class="highlight">China</span>, he was refused permission by a Liberal Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Now we cannot turn around without hearing that the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  is waving a red flag, putting a line in terms of the position of <span class="highlight">China</span> which the average member of the Labor Party regards as being somewhat chauvinistic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We cannot turn around without hearing that the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  who also called members of the Labor Party communists and dupes, is walking around <span class="highlight">China</span> looking like an American tourist with a bundle of cameras around his neck, almost singing  The East is Red. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us look at <span class="highlight">China</span> also from the point of view of our foreign aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps in the future of the Asian Development Bank <span class="highlight">China</span> might be a recipient of funds also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again I can only revert to the case of <span class="highlight">China</span> but I think the situation would be the same in many of the other nations throughout South East Asia as far as their methods are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recent visit by the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  to <span class="highlight">China</span> would indicate that within that country there is a potential for a great expansion of our trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span> look to Australia not only as a friend but also as a potential trading partner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to trade and have strong friendly relationships with other nations, I would suggest that of the nations that I visited earlier this year Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span> could be of mutual assistance to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the advice and the hopes made clear by the Government in respect of trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>, particularly in relation to the export of technology from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: Has the Government an attitude on barter arrangements between <span class="highlight">China</span> and an Australian exporting firm such as those that have existed with a number of British exporters for whom marketing rights in Great Britain were reserved exclusively by <span class="highlight">China</span> following the use of the original British technology? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As we know, my colleague, the Minister for Trade and Resources, has recently returned from a very successful trade mission to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> is going to expand very greatly in the years immediately ahead of us, just as it has expanded very greatly with many other countries of Asia- Korea and South East Asian countries- and with the Middle East. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But up to the present time, trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> has gone ahead on a very profitable basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A million tonnes of wheat goes to Japan, a million tonnes to Egypt,  Vi  million tonnes to <span class="highlight">China</span>, 1 million tonnes to South East Asia and Indonesia and three quarters of a million tonnes to the Middle East. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, in 1976, South Africa and <span class="highlight">China</span> increased their shares of the Japanese market to 25 per cent and 23 per cent respectively compared with 19 per cent and 17 per cent respectively the year before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>South Africa and <span class="highlight">China</span> have got under our guard and increased their share of the Japanese market, as I just pointed out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to say a few words on what is known as the great and growing market of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The glittering prospects of the <span class="highlight">China</span> market may not exist in the way we have been led to believe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The famous British house of Jardine, Matheson and Co. also had this prospect of a euphoric market in <span class="highlight">China</span> after the treaty of Nanking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The firm immediately exported knives and forks to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was also told that the Chinese did not dress properly so it exported suits and western clothes to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was told that the Chinese could have a sense of culture so it exported pianos to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those goods rusted and rotted in ports along the coast of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Trade and Resources  (Mr Anthony),  who is at the table, returned recently from <span class="highlight">China</span> and quite correctly said that there may be wonderful prospects for the export of Australian technology to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Industry and Commerce  (Mr Lynch)  a little earlier spoke about the capacity for exports to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>’s possession of foreign exchange is quite small. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the reason why <span class="highlight">China</span> desires to engage overwhelmingly in the barter trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My information is that even at the present time 25 per cent of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s trade is in terms of barter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, barter trade is important to <span class="highlight">China</span> and will remain important in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means that Australia in her exports to <span class="highlight">China</span> will have to look very carefully to see the way in which those exports will be consumated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those exports will have to contend with the fact that <span class="highlight">China</span> is short of foreign exchange. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently, a British firm- a famous toy manufacturer- indicated that it had made trade agreements with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general Manager and Director was in Australia recently and indicated that his firm had made similar deals with respect to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The firm exported its second division toy technology to <span class="highlight">China</span>; the toys and the goods are to be made in <span class="highlight">China</span>, in return for which it retains the marketing rights in Great Britain and in a number of other European countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will go through a few of them: The goods which are made in <span class="highlight">China</span> and are then able to be exported are made basically with slave labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The excellent article written by Professor Audrey Donnithorne in the issue of  Quadrant  on <span class="highlight">China</span>- she is a woman with an impeccable reputation- pointed out, for example, that in the wage structure in that country there had been no adjustment in wages whatsoever from the late 1 950s to 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>’s official wage policy is that wages rise below the rate of productivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Were such barter deals to exist between Australian exporting firms and <span class="highlight">China</span>, the first question would be: What rights will exist for the exporting firm to market, similarly to what the Dunbee Corporation has done, those goods in this nation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How competitive <span class="highlight">China</span> is going to be with Singapore and other Southeast and East Asian exporters of light industrial goods remains to be seen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it also means a great deal to Australia, because the export of such technology to <span class="highlight">China</span>, with results similar to those that occurred in respect of the British corporation mentioned, would interrupt and overtake the development of trade between ASEAN countries and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I suggest to the House even at this late stage that various matters concerning trade between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span> need to be examined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will they be acceptable irrespective of the circumstances under which the goods will be manufactured in <span class="highlight">China</span> with the technology that is expected to be exported from this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>’s possession of foreign exchange is not sufficient to tie in with the rate of growth which she proposes under the five and ten-year plans which she has promulgated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the reception to celebrate <span class="highlight">China</span>’s National Day at the Canberra Rex Hotel last Thursday evening you distinguished yourself by becoming the only guest who could be heard above all others in that part of the room in which you and I were discussing, i.a. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the advice and the hopes made clear by the Government in respect of trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>, particularly in relation to the export of technology from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-58-81">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister Has the Government an attitude on barter arrangements between <span class="highlight">China</span> and an Australian exporting firm such as those that have existed with a number of British exporters for whom marketing rights in Great Britain were reserved exclusively by <span class="highlight">China</span> following the use of the original British technology? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-58-81">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> is, of course, anxious to obtain a wide range of westem technology and is adopting a flexible attitude to the means by which it achieves that objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-58-81">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chinese party would of course insist on handling the sale of the product within <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-58-81">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although <span class="highlight">China</span> has paid cash for much of her technology imports in the past, there is growing evidence of payment in kind forming part of her contractual arrangements in more recent deals with European and Japanese suppliers of technology in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-58-81">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian companies contemplating ‘buy back’ deals with <span class="highlight">China</span>, or any other country for that matter, should take early steps to satisfy the Reserve Bank, Treasury and Customs’ officials as to the commercial valuation placed on the goods being accepted as full or part payment for the Australian technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-58-81">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the  Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Resources whether yesterday, in addressing the National Export Conference, he said that the Middle East was a better short-term market than <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, was this statement, as has been suggested in Press reports today, a contradiction of recent Government and industry statements indicating that <span class="highlight">China</span> is the most exciting export market for Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> obviously, because of the dimensions of its market, offers one of the most exciting prospects on earth now that it has embarked upon a course of modernisation which will in time lift its living standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In recent years our attitude has been to recognise one <span class="highlight">China</span>, with its capital in Peking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before my last trip to the Middle East I asked for a factual report on how other countries that similarly recognised <span class="highlight">China</span> and had a relationship with Taiwan handled their trade relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I have that report I will be in a better position to comment further, but we must recognise that <span class="highlight">China</span> is a very important market to us and a very significant country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular, opportunities are opening for Australia in Japan, South East Asia, the Middle East and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I cannot think of anything that is doing greater damage to our national interest than a handful of louts taking upon themselves what should be Australia’s national policy in relation to trade with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> has become an extremely important trading country for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the last 10 years our trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> has increased from $20m to $580m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are hoping that the market will grow still more, but if there is to be this continual disruption and discrimination against <span class="highlight">China</span> because somebody does not like its involvement in the Vietnam war all I can say is that those people are doing great harm to a great Australian industry, to the nation as a whole and to our relationship with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Although <span class="highlight">China</span> has indicated that it will act with prudence, there must no underestimation of the serious danger posed to our region and to the world by the present conflict between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has a vital interest in <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam swiftly and peacefully settling their differences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have called and call on Vietnam to withdraw its forces from Kampuchea, and on <span class="highlight">China</span> to withdraw its forces from Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one can be certain of the course that the conflict in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> will take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australians are penetrating the new and important markets emerging in <span class="highlight">China</span>, South East Asia, and the Middle East, and the trade drive conducted by the  Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Resources, and the Minister for Special Trade Representations  (Mr Garland)  and the trade missions that have left Australia for overseas are making rewarding progress for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the point he does refer to, which is of concern to all people in this country, relates to the conflict in the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> peninsula. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it impossible to establish beyond any reasonable doubt in my mind who is right and who is wrong, Vietnam or <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister,  Mr Fraser,  was muted in his criticism yesterday of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s attack on Vietnam, claiming that it was the direct result of Vietnam ‘s earlier invasion of Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact,  Mr Fraser  spent more time referring to Vietnam in his statements yesterday than he did to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put to one side the very disturbing prospects which could arise if the escalation of the conflict between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam were to get out of hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the results that will flow from this conflict is that <span class="highlight">China</span>, I expect, will be playing a far greater role among ASEAN countries as a sort of counterpoise to what is expected to be greater Soviet influence in the South East Asian region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that unless a satisfactory conclusion can be arranged in relation to this conflict, and quickly, we will see an escalation of Soviet presence in the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> peninsula area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said before, and I repeat, that I believe the best way in which we can establish secure, long-term stability in the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> peninsula is by providing aid for the peaceful reconstruction of” Vietnam and encouraging Western countries to provide generous aid for that purposenot so generous, of course, that Vietnam can establish herself as a supremely powerful industrial, and accordingly military, country in the area- so that she can feel more secure and confident in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not until the fourth paragraph of the opening part of the statement that the Government says that it has ‘identified the position in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> as deteriorating and potentially dangerous’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It fought elections on the basis of the domino theory, the downward thrust of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States quite fairly and properly wishes to have normal relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> and because of that, the Australian Government says: ‘That is the smart thing for us to do.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It recognised <span class="highlight">China</span> and established diplomatic relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a fixation with alignments, particularly the espousal in 1976 of a treaty between Australia, Japan, <span class="highlight">China</span> and the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has failed to maintain a balance in relations with the Soviet Union on the one hand and <span class="highlight">China</span> on the other hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  was quite right to draw to the attention of the people of Australia the great changes that had taken place overseas, in particular the recognition by the United States of America of <span class="highlight">China</span>, and the problems in Iran and in parts of Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister and the Government are to be congratulated on asking <span class="highlight">China</span> to withdraw from Vietnam and the Vietnamese to withdraw from <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was my pleasure recently to visit <span class="highlight">China</span> and Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In <span class="highlight">China</span> petrol costs $1.50 a gallon; in Japan it costs more than $2 a gallon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned a few moments ago that it was a pleasure to be a member of a delegation to <span class="highlight">China</span> and Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> purchases $5 87m worth of our products; we purchase, in return, $11 lm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The imbalance could be made up with the importation of oil from <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> has 900 million people all of whom have to be fed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our wheat harvest will be a record one, and the long term contract just completed with <span class="highlight">China</span> for  Vh  million tonnes of wheat over the next three years is further evidence of the healthy situation that is developing within the rural industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have been greatly encouraged by announcements in recent weeks such as the decision by ICI Australia Ltd, to spend $900m on expansion in Victoria and New South Wales; the intention of General Motors-Holden’s Pty Ltd to spend $2 10m on a new engine plant; the $20m contract recently signed by a Melbourne company to supply prefabricated motel units to <span class="highlight">China</span>; the $18m expansion to the Brisbane refinery by the Ampol company; and the possibility that the PekoWallsend smelter at Tennant Creek will be re-opened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">China</span>- Vietnam conflict can threaten millions of lives not only in this region but also in other parts of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fraser Government does not understand the suffering of the people of <span class="highlight">China</span>, the people of Vietnam and the people of Kampuchea today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is necessary for me to say now, before going into detail, that the Australian Government’s recent statements and actions concerning the crisis in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> have been mere echoes of the statements made by the United States Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in this light that we need to examine the role that the Australian Government has played in relation to events in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had a long friendship with the people of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I visited <span class="highlight">China</span> in 1960 and in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conflicts on the <span class="highlight">China</span>-Vietnam border again were stirred up over many questions, over the indigenous Chinese people in Vietnam whom we call the Hua people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conflicts in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> are complex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, we should call for the demilitarisation of the Vietnam-<span class="highlight">China</span> border under international supervision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, we should propose that the independence and sovereignty of Kampuchea should be guaranteed by international agreement and that the Kampuchean people be left to resolve their internal problems free of interference from <span class="highlight">China</span>, Vietnam or any other outside forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourthly, we should support the Vietnamese Government’s proposals for the resolution of all Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> border disputes by internationally supervised negotiations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally there is <span class="highlight">China</span>’s attack upon Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not heard the latest news, but it appears imminent that Russia will attack <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After 3 1/2 years of comparative quiet, South East Asia is again the scene of armed conflict- first with the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea, then with the conflict between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conflicts reflect and were created by the hostility and rivalry existing among four states: The Soviet Union, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Vietnam and Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our region the conflict in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> is the greatest cause of concern and I now turn to look in more detail at this and the Government’s reaction to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic situation which now exists in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> is a matter of great concern and disappointment to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation began to deteriorate last year with increasing hostilities between Kampuchea and Vietnam, a worsening relationship between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam and the signing of a Treaty of Friendship and Co-operation- which included a military assistance clause- between the Soviet Union and Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Vietnamese attack on Kampuchea was an attack by a client of the Soviet Union on a client of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever its motivation the attack bore directly on the rivalry and competition between the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span> for long term influence in the region- and, more generally, on the whole Sino-Soviet dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>’s subsequent incursion into Vietnam can only be understood as a reaction to Vietnam’s treaty with the Soviet Union, its invasion of Kampuchea and the installation there of a pro- Vietnamese Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>’s motives in striking across the border do not relate only to a border dispute but are aimed at Vietnam’s political influence in Kampuchea, which is beyond <span class="highlight">China</span>’s immediate reach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam therefore is not likely to be resolved with any element of permanence by a settlement on the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Vietnam-<span class="highlight">China</span> border which leaves the situation in Kampuchea unchanged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have called on Vietnam to withdraw its forces from Kampuchea, on <span class="highlight">China</span> to withdraw its forces from Vietnam and on the Soviet Union to exercise restraint to prevent the last turn of the screw, which could be disastrous not merely for the region but for the peace of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has accused the Government of a proChina bias. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the extent that <span class="highlight">China</span>, if left alone and unprovoked, would prefer peace and stability at this stage of its development in order to concentrate on internal modernisation, and only to that extent, there is a convergence between its present interest and ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He emphasised that there should be immediate cease-fires in the conflicts, that Vietnam must withdraw its forces from Kampuchea and <span class="highlight">China</span> must withdraw its forces from Vietnam and that there should be concerted efforts leading to lasting settlements, possibly using the good offices of the Secretary General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the changes which have taken place at that levelthe establishment of full diplomatic relations between, the United States of America and <span class="highlight">China</span>, the expansion of Japan’s relations with Chinaare in themselves desirable; but what significance they will ultimately have will depend on how they fit into a picture which is not yet complete. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for these reasons that we made a real effort to prevent the situation in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> from developing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must go back to considering the fundamental problems of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very important that all honourable members opposite should go back in history and look at the facts of the situation in Vietnam at that time because then Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> was a continuing festering sore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a theory at that time of the downward thrust of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The John Foster Dulles position was that we must contain <span class="highlight">China</span> and must be involved in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw then diplomatic efforts made virtually to involve the United States in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Elections were fought and won in Australia on a platform of being against <span class="highlight">China</span> and the threat of communism by <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We were the first government to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span> because we went and saw the problems of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We had built good relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We turned over the ground that was poisoned in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> and <span class="highlight">China</span> by the likes of Menzies, Hasluck, Barwick and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Prime Minister and Foreign Minister could not sustain that relationship for its own virtue and instead proposed that we enter into another alliance, a treaty, between <span class="highlight">China</span>, Japan and the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They relate to Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> and <span class="highlight">China</span>; the Association of South East Asian Nations; West Asia; and the global balance, arms control and nuclear proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have seen war again in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> in the past two months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the Foreign Minister will know, as a former Army Minister, that imperialist armies of occupation in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> find victory elusive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But in fact it has yet to be shown that any war in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> in the past 30 years has posed any threat to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Members of the Liberal and National Country parties have always said that a Liberal-National Country Party government had to be elected to prevent the downward thrust of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We did not recognise when that was said that they were going to take the side of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Second, there is the history of the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> Communist Party, including the desire for domination by the Vietnamese within that group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that period, however, <span class="highlight">China</span> established a firm tie to the Sihanouk regime which it nurtured in exile after Sihanouk was deposed by Lon Nol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> became the champion of anti-imperialist Cambodian independence in a way clearly reflecting <span class="highlight">China</span>’s desire to contain Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With the collapse of the American-sponsored government in Phnom Penh in 1975, <span class="highlight">China</span> became patron of a government that came in from the jungle after a quarter of a century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>’s policy of support for that regime took it down a blind alley dictated by strategy and ‘consistency’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1970 <span class="highlight">China</span> was still in the process of emergence from the Cultural Revolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But it was not until after the collapse of another United Statessupported attack from South Vietnam- the Lam Son operation into Laos in February-March 1971- that <span class="highlight">China</span> began to negotiate with the United States, which it saw as a declining threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not until after the purge of Lin Piao in September 1971 that the anti-Soviet line in <span class="highlight">China</span> assumed clear ascendency and began to take the shape of a search for what Mao called a ‘united front’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> embarked on this united front strategy because of its sense of encirclement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">China</span> of Mao, irrationally feared by those men opposite in this chamber in the 1960s, did not commit its armies to battle in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">China</span> of Deng Xiaoping, embraced by these men, has committed its armies into Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We opposed that as also we would oppose the cancellation of the Government’s $50 billion credit line for exports to <span class="highlight">China</span> which the Government’s logic should force it to cancel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time of the Korean War, the Soviet Union was pleased to see <span class="highlight">China</span> at war and can welcome now in its own terms the dissipation of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s energy in the south. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Soviet Union need not lift a finger in the sense that it may well hope that <span class="highlight">China</span>’s influence could fail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to <span class="highlight">China</span>’s relations with the West, it can no longer be called the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation’s sixteenth member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government should be able to anticipate the problems and should be able to exercise a moderating influence on <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Soviet Union was delighted when <span class="highlight">China</span> was embroiled in Korea in the 1950s and those qualities of spreading the interest and flexibility which so characterise Soviet policy are likely to be satisfied to see <span class="highlight">China</span> at war with Vietnam and <span class="highlight">China</span>’s relations with Vietnam being shattered for a generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We make the point that the conservative elements in the United States could well think: ‘This is the right time to play the <span class="highlight">China</span> card’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They could say: ‘Now we will play the <span class="highlight">China</span> card’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these perspectives then the Government has pursued a policy in relation to IndoChina that is as bankrupt and destructive to Western interests as its policy towards the last Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The gulf between the ASEAN nations and Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> and <span class="highlight">China</span> will be widened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we have heard from the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  is an historical resume of events in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> over the last 25 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is so easy to imagine a situation where one mistake, one miscalculation, one rifle bullet across an international frontier, could well be enough to launch the Soviet Union against <span class="highlight">China</span>- an action which would result, quite likely, in disastrous consequences for all of mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has adequately covered the various problems relating to the <span class="highlight">China</span>- Vietnam situation and there is no point in covering that matter any further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, current intelligence estimates are that between 1964 and 1977 the Soviets spent an average of about 10 to IS per cent of their defence budget on forces oriented towards the Peoples Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One consequence of such a role would be that Australia would not seek to take sides in situations of tension or conflict, such as that currently raging in the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> peninsula. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not mean that in all circumstances we avoid the obligation to choose who is right and who is wrong when clearly there is an aggressor and another nation which is a victim, but more generally in relation to Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> the principle I am stating applies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now move on to deal with Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has postured and blustered over recent events in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> because it has no effective role to play. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has painted itself into a corner by its anti-Soviet and antiVietnam attitudes on the one hand and its excessive pro-<span class="highlight">China</span> position on the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given our involvement in the previous Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> war, that was an unusual and significant situation and one for which we should be thankful to the previous Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party, in office, was responsible for resuming normal relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, we welcome the resumption of relations between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the United States- and we hope they too, will grow and prosper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we recognise that <span class="highlight">China</span> has her own reasons for not wanting to see SALT II come into existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly, it would suit <span class="highlight">China</span> to see the United States with overwhelming weapons superiority over the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regrettably, over the years and particularly during the non-policy period of the Whitlam Government, our status in the Third World and everywhere else- in particular <span class="highlight">China</span>- was lowered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Possibly it created diplomatic relations of a kind with Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think it is fairly obvious that the acceleration of the attitude towards Australia and the United States of America over the last few months has indicated that the present regime in <span class="highlight">China</span> would have infinitely more confidence and infinitely more trust in a future allied to our philosophy and politics than that of members of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have suggested that even <span class="highlight">China</span> is now attacking Labor’s golden idol, Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one were to read the statements made by the foreign ministers of other great nations one would realise that there has been an obvious attempt in each case to try to appreciate a situation which involves the possibility of an unthinkable conflict, that is, the possibility of the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span> coming into conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not suggesting for one moment that they gave me classified information, but the general impression there is that America is getting nearer to a genuine understanding- and this is being achieved in a remarkable way- with the Soviet Union at the same time as this very wonderful association is being built up with communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the same would happen in the three countries in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, in <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Taiwan, Eastern Europe, the Philippines and in many other countries of South America, Africa and the Middle East. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some cases the difference may be only marginal such as in the disputes between the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span> or between Chile and Argentina. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to make this point in relation to the conflict in South East Asia: It is utter hypocrisy for the Soviet Union to criticise <span class="highlight">China</span> or the United States for interfering in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It sets out Australia’s real concerns about what has been occurring recently, particularly in IndoChina and Iran. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within that we have an intense competition between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and <span class="highlight">China</span>, each with a paranoid fear of the other, each believing that the other is bent on world domination and each determined to take steps to prevent the other from achieving the aims that are ascribed to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as what is happening in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> is concerned, it is my view that our role is one of urging caution and restraint, as the Minister has pointed out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would imagine that if a direct request were made and the Soviet Union attacked <span class="highlight">China</span> in any force, the Chinese would neutralise their southern flank with a much, much heavier blow being directed at Vietnam than at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of those strategic aims is the encirclement and containment of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Simple potentialities that could arise are threats to our offshore fields, such as those on the North West Shelf; the blockade of our shipping lines to Japan or <span class="highlight">China</span> which would throw the Australian economy into serious disarray; and other regional instabilities that could arise at any time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was only in July 1971 when  Sir William  McMahon, expressed something like horror when Gough Whitlam announced that he was going to visit the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Mr Whitlam  went to <span class="highlight">China</span> the then Prime Minister was reported in the  Age  on 1 3 July 1 97 1 as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr McMahon said the Labor mission to <span class="highlight">China</span> had begun as an ingenuous exercise by the ALP to play party politics with wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He accused the then Leader of the Opposition of allowing himself to be used as a spokesman for North Vietnam and <span class="highlight">China</span> at the Paris peace talks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the communist states of the world are essentially monolithic and that, for example, Yugoslavia, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Vietnam and <span class="highlight">China</span> had identical aims and worked virtually under a unified command. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chiang Kai-shek’s regime in Taiwan was to be recognised as the legitimate government of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States was to be supported in its refusal to recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> or to admit it to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Supporting and maintaining an anticommunist regime in South Vietnam would prove to be an effective means of containing <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Prime Minister, who in the 1960s was the rising hope of the stern unbending Santamarians over <span class="highlight">China</span>, is now an advocate of closer relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and has applauded the Carter Administration’s recent recognition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was disappointed to find very little reference in the Minister’s statement to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reference was made to <span class="highlight">China</span> in the context of the war in Vietnam but there was no reference to the enormous significance, both domestically and outside, of the political changes that have been going on in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the honourable member for Dawson  (Mr Braithwaite)  and I paid a state visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> in July 1978, we were both struck- and this is a highly bipartisan comment- by the widespread fear, which was expressed everywhere we went, about the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">China</span> at the moment there is enormous fear of the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That fear is exacerbated by the presence of Russian vessels at the Cam Ranh Bay base and in the South <span class="highlight">China</span> Sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will it, for example, mean increased opportunities for Australia to trade with the most populous trade combination in the world covering about 1,100 million people or will it simply mean a threat to Australia’s trading position whereby in the long term <span class="highlight">China</span> sells raw materials to Japan instead of us and imports higher technology in return? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can say to the honourable member that at the time I was Foreign Minister we drafted a number of the documents as a basis on which thinking could proceed, firstly as to the special question of whether there could be the requisite majority and, secondly, to ensure that a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council was voted to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> while sustaining the position of Taiwan in the General Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that when the former Labor Prime Minister,  Mr Gough  Whitlam, as Opposition Leader went to <span class="highlight">China</span> to lay the foundations for the diplomatic recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span> when Labor assumed office, he was called the friend of communists, et cetera by those in the Government ranks today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When  Mr Whitlam  went to <span class="highlight">China</span> in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us have a look at the position particularly so far as Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a steady deterioration in relationships between Vietnam and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>, the middle kingdom, which has always been deeply concerned on the question of encirclement saw that as a direct threat- as a direct encirclement by the USSR to the north, the west and the south. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, it is understandable in the light of all those happenings that <span class="highlight">China</span> eventually felt it was being encircled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a very difficult period ahead for the world because of the tensions on the <span class="highlight">China</span>-Soviet border. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should also be very thankful at this point in time for the restraint displayed by the USSR because when <span class="highlight">China</span> invaded Vietnam everyone was concerned that there could be immediate intervention by the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is to say, there would be a non-aligned communist country- a country not aligned with the Soviet Union or with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make it clear that the Labor Party was the party, when it was in government and in opposition in this country, which furthered the relationships with <span class="highlight">China</span> that finally led to the diplomatic recognition of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Labor Party which today understands the concerns of <span class="highlight">China</span> on the question of encirclement and asks that there be a withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it would only need Soviet action against <span class="highlight">China</span>, followed perhaps by action taken against the Soviets by the United States of America, for a very difficult world situation to develop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most of them have been completely unimportant matters of detail when one considers the international scene, at what could happen and at what is happening in South East Asia, in <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the United States attempts to woo the present Chinese leadership for big markets for the big corporations, it is a most audacious act on the part of the United States to send its ambassador to <span class="highlight">China</span> at a critical time when the Chinese have invaded the people in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Vietnam was attempting to free itself from the powerless, triangular balancing between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was the psychology of fear, which infiltrators had spread among the Hua people, that there would be an invasion of Vietnam by <span class="highlight">China</span> and that if the Hua people remained in Vietnam they would be treated as traitors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At that time 160,000 Hua people, who are Vietnamese people of Chinese descent, migrated north to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Major disasters  for the Western world have occurred in rapid succession on the international scene- in the Horn of Africa, in southern Africa, in the Middle East and, in the past few weeks, in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> was prompted by territorial ambitions in Vietnam, but they wished, probably naturally enough, to make sure that they were not outflanked by the Soviet Union in Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Chinese intervention in Vietnam aimed at showing to the Soviet that <span class="highlight">China</span> would not sit idly by while her interests were put in jeopardy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I venture to suggest that if these events had occurred in this way 20-odd years ago, or a little later, the Russians already would have invaded <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> has managed to create a different atmosphere about itself I do not know that the Government of <span class="highlight">China</span> is so much more free but most of us feel that we can talk to the Chinese and come to some sort of negotiating position with them more easily than with the Russians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the situation with Vietnam and <span class="highlight">China</span>, a small nation and a huge one? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One very favourable indication of an upturn in the poultry industry and an example of an initiative which could be emulated by others in the industry was the announcement in December last year of the signing of a $6m contract by the Great Sincere Co. for the establishment of poultry farms in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless, substantial forces from both <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam are in close proximity to each other and further fighting obviously could break out again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should add, however, a cautionary note: The issue between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam is not likely to be resolved permanently if the situation in Kampuchea remains unchanged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Who knows; it could be that <span class="highlight">China</span> will have withdrawn all its military presence in Vietnam by the time this present parliamentary debate concludes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I can only hope that this most powerful, democratically-elected leader in the world has thought through his decision for America to be a major supplier of military equipment to <span class="highlight">China</span> and what the results of this trading in arms might be for Australia’s part of the world during the next decade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By all means let Australia trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>; by all means let us be friends, even buddies, but for Heaven’s sake, let us not be blinded to the implications of the arming of <span class="highlight">China</span> by certain Western countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that we have been badly mistaken in confusing our natural and proper abhorrence of the policy of racial apartheid as practised in so many countries under a great variety of names with official disinterest and forgetting to observe very objectively the issue of international power politics, to quote the Minister, which have become of fundamental importance, particularly in the areas of southern Africa and Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Kennedy  (Mr Katter),  while waxing eloquent against what he called ‘atheistic communism’ told us and the country that the ‘atheistic communists’, that is, the <span class="highlight">China</span> brand, ‘have infinitely more confidence and infinitely more trust in a future allied to our’- that is the Country Partyphilosophy and politics than in that of the Opposition’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we give the central place to the traditional issues of power politics we may be led to forget that the threat to the peace of the world and to the security of this country derives much more fundamentally from the gap between the rich nations and the poor, between the developed and the developing nations than it does from the global ambitions of the Soviet Union or the paranoia of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To interpret the invasion of Kampuchea by Vietnam as, in essence, the actions of a Soviet puppet is the same order of misinterpretation as was the conservative interpretation of the Vietnamese civil war as part of the downward thrust of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if we are to understand and contribute to a solution in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, we need first to focus on the history, ambitions and objectives of Vietnam and not obscure the central problem by seeing everything through anti-Soviet eyes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States, backed by the then Liberal-Country Party Government welcomed the destruction of the Cambodian regime of Prince Sihanouk in 1970, the last opportunity to keep Cambodia, now Kampuchea, out of the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> holocaust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Above all, we should not exaggerate the global menace of the Soviet Union to the extent that it blinds us to the local realities of Iran, Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> and Southern Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am simply saying that the great danger is to avoid the kind of geo-political outlook reflected in the Foreign Minister’s speech which blinds us to the local details of the problems in Iran, Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> and Southern Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the triangular balance of power between <span class="highlight">China</span>, the United States and the Soviet Unionone could also include Western Europe- the odd man out at the moment is the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a sense the deep and bitter division between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia gives the United States an opportunity to balance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite clear that the American strategy in respect of Asia and the West Pacific rests upon an alliance between three powers- the United States, Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What Australia must be aware of is the simple fact that all the analyses made, both before Carter became  President  of the United States and subsequent to his election, especially since the <span class="highlight">China</span> accord of late last year, have ignored Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was stated that by cutting off that aid we were reducing whatever leverage or bargaining power we might have in respect of Vietnam and her incursions in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>- into what I call Cambodia but what these days all the clever people call Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to <span class="highlight">China</span>, a paragraph in the statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  indicated that economic events in <span class="highlight">China</span> do not necessarily mean that everything has altered, nor has it altered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Very often when I consider <span class="highlight">China</span> I ask myself what are the precise points in terms of foreign policy it has surrendered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In terms of North Korea versus South Korea, Deng Xiaoping has not retreated one centimetre from <span class="highlight">China</span>’s traditional support for North Korea vis-a-vis South Korea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In relation to Taiwan, <span class="highlight">China</span> has not surrendered its aim to take Taiwan by force if it needs to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In respect of support for insurgency movements in IndoChina, Thailand and Malaysia, <span class="highlight">China</span> was asked to desist from broadcasting support to the revolutionary groups in those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not believe for one moment that mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> would put an embargo on what we ought to be able to do legitimately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that <span class="highlight">China</span> would do that, and certainly it is not in a position to do that today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Taiwan must be considered, and guidelines ought to be drawn up in respect of the trade relationships now being pursued between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In future it is expected that contributions will be made from Argentina, Egypt, India and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point appears later in the statement where the Minister, when discussing the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> situation, stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic situation which now exists in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> is a matter of great concern and disappointment to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Vietnamese attack on Kampuchea was an attack by a client of the Soviet Union ona client of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that speech to the Security Council,  Mr Barton  emphasised that one could not look at the present violence in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> independently from what has become known as the Vietnamese refugee problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will refer to two specific matters linked with the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> conflict which I believe give substance to the concern that I express. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lest anybody be in any doubt as to where Indonesia is standing on the question of the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> conflict, I say that one can be quite certain that it is not supporting the Chinese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To wash its face from the failure in defending the ousted Cambodian Government, <span class="highlight">China</span> now tries to launch an aggression on Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lest honourable members want other comments from the Indonesian Press, I refer to an article in which the ‘Chinese aggression’, as it is called, against Vietnam is described as reckless, and which says that there is no justification for the invasion of Vietnam by an expansionist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Jack Hill, the blind miner, can see why <span class="highlight">China</span> did what it did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When buildings and villages inside Chinese territories were shot, blown up, damaged and destroyed, as has been demonstrated clearly by television films and remains uncontradicted by the Vietnamese, what was <span class="highlight">China</span> to do? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> was entitled to do what it did, and I support what it did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there was a threat: The belligerent attitude of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From a distance, of course, armchair analysts can say that was only bluster- <span class="highlight">China</span> has no intention of really doing what it threatens to do because it has other priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should concern Australians that the Foreign Minister of our nearest and largest neighbour is actually courting and encouraging a relationship with Hanoi and therefore with Moscow, and is permitting in his own country a denigration of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the right and the wrongs of the Vietnamese involvement in Kampuchea or even its border disputes with its northern neighbour, <span class="highlight">China</span> in my view is not justified in ravaging through Vietnam in the way it is doing at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was at the 1954 Geneva Convention that relations between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam began to deteriorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this conference in Geneva <span class="highlight">China</span> sought three main objectives: Firstly, it wanted to neutralise IndoChina and rid it of the threat of American imperialism; secondly, it hoped that this would enable it to break the military encirclement of <span class="highlight">China</span> by means of an international treaty which in turn would allow it to break out of its diplomatic isolation and dependence on the USSR; finally, if <span class="highlight">China</span> could achieve this by acting as the guarantor of neutral states such as <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>’s isolation ended only when the war between Vietnam and the US ended and when it looked like being won by the Vietnamese who would be no longer beholden to Peking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In President Nixon, <span class="highlight">China</span> found a willing ally in the return to the Geneva agreement as <span class="highlight">China</span> had conceived it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As both the United States and <span class="highlight">China</span> wanted the Paris peace accords to last, Vietnam was to remain divided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Vietnamese victory in 1975 was a smack in the face to both <span class="highlight">China</span> and America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that <span class="highlight">China</span> sees South East Asia as its own sphere of influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider the longstanding dispute between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam over the Paracel and Spratly Islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> occupies the Paracel Islands, after seizing them from Vietnam in 1974, and Vietnam occupies most of the Spratly Islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the dispute is not simply over the islands; <span class="highlight">China</span> claims the seabed over a vast area south of the Spratly Islands where oil deposits hold out the prospect of economic independence for Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is correct, as reported in yesterday’s Press, that <span class="highlight">China</span> is withdrawing its troops from Vietnam, I am pleased, but I am also wary as I recall the old saying: ‘When the shooting war stops the economic war begins’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main issue is <span class="highlight">China</span>’s preoccupation with its own interests in South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was <span class="highlight">China</span> which played the part of the aggressor and seized the Paracels when Vietnam was well and truly involved in its war with the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, talking to <span class="highlight">China</span>, through you, I say: You should have been supporting Vietnam in its struggle for liberation instead of making territorial claims to enrich yourself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>, let us look at your track record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>, you supported the United States and reactionary forces in the PakistanBangladesh conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>, did you not give support to the counterrevolutionary forces in Chile, the military junta? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>, did you evict from Peking by force the Chilean ambassador, to the joy of the United States? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is somewhat difficult for me to understand why the leaders of a socialist government in <span class="highlight">China</span>, a country with a long and eventually successful struggle against the bastions of the Western world capitalism, should give its support and encouragement to the actions of others who are the perpetrators of ruthless capitalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> has attacked and slandered the peace and friendship treaty between the USSR, Vietnam and Laos. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, I leave <span class="highlight">China</span> with a statement made by one of its former prominent leaders after the Revolution, Liu Shao-chi. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> would do well to recall and to do something in connection with this very important statement made to its people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Deep conflict between Vietnam and <span class="highlight">China</span>, on the one hand and Vietnam and Cambodia on the other hand was one of the main factors rapidly transforming geo-political alignments in South East and East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The consolidation of the three states under the wing of Vietnam looks like the fulfilment of Ho Chi Minh ‘s dream of a communist Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> federation, especially in view of the American withdrawal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia has taken a middle stance in the <span class="highlight">China</span>- Vietnam affair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is utter hypocrisy for the Soviet Union to criticise <span class="highlight">China</span> or the United States for interfering in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the case of the most recent flashpoint in world affairs, Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, the Government’s criticism and protest has been so muted as to be completely unnoticeable in the world forum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the Prime Minister and his Government to remain even-handed the Government would have to consider severing such ties with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Its spokesman in another place cautioned that it was unwise to believe that future relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> would be any easier or less complicated than they had been in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>’s principal preoccupation at the moment is its dispute with its neighbour, the Russian bear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> will continue to press this point, regardless of other countries’ viewpoints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>’s shift in domestic policy, multilateral relations and public relations is as impressive as it is revolutionary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister, in June 1976, made his position concerning <span class="highlight">China</span> and the USSR crystal clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, in the South East Asian situation, where currently there exist conflicts between Kampuchea and Vietnam and between Vietnam and <span class="highlight">China</span>, we are told simplistically, if impressively, that the conflicts reflect and were created by the hostility and rivalry existing among four States- the Soviet Union, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Vietnam and Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Minister’s terms, it was clearly in the United States’ geo-political interests, after the conclusion of that notorious and infamous war in Vietnam and Cambodia, to provide massive resources to rebuild Vietnam on the basis that that would be the only way to lessen the dependence of that country on either the Soviet Union or <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result is that Vietnam has been drawn into a struggle between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union in which her own national interests ought not to be at stake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States invested billions of dollars in the war in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It involved itself in that way and, as one of the consequences of that involvement, Vietnam has been drawn into what might be described, in the Minister’s terms, as a geo-political conflict between the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He must know perfectly well that everybody associated with foreign affairs in this country expressed their profound regret about <span class="highlight">China</span>’s sudden action of punishing a next door neighbour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He questioned whether <span class="highlight">China</span> had any legality to occupy those islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From my knowledge of history, the islands of the South <span class="highlight">China</span> Sea were under the control of the emperors- even the last empress- of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the only reason those islands were under the control of Vietnam was due to the treaties drawn up by France in 1802. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the last day of the session last year I recall that I asked the Leader of the House  (Mr Sinclair)  and  Mr Speaker  to recall the Parliament if Australian troops were to be committed overseas, or if the situation in Iran became worse, or if the events in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> worsened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to place on record my personal thanks to the officials in the embassies of <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Soviet Union, the United States and France from whom I sought advice during the recent conflict in South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight I want to express my own views because I have been actively involved in foreign affairs since the first Parliamentary mission to <span class="highlight">China</span> in 1955, through the Suez crisis, through Aden, and through the problems we have experienced since then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first major event that changed world history in the Far East was the complete disruption of the Soviet-<span class="highlight">China</span> communist bloc which existed right through until the early 1960s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there was the rise of the industrial power of Japan, the friendship treaty signed last year between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Japan, and, in addition, the discovery of the oil field in the Gulf of Po-Ai. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next events which precipitated the crises which we have experienced were the United States’ withdrawal from Vietnam and, on the other hand, her recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> after 30 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, she did not quite understand that to continue to be antagonistic towards <span class="highlight">China</span> was not in any way helping her policy in the Far East. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand when I visited <span class="highlight">China</span> as the guest of the People’s Republic, a visit for which I am grateful, it was quite clear that the Chinese, for their part, could not countenance the existence of a bloc of Soviet organised states on their southern borders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the objective of the foreign policy of <span class="highlight">China</span> is to make certain that Laos and Kampuchea are free and the objective of the foreign policy of Vietnam is to hold both Kampuchea and Laos we will be in serious difficulty for many years to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We pick on Russia, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Indonesia or the United States as being to blame in various issues and crises round the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what has happened between Vietnam and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> is totally controlled by Communism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My second point is that the dispute amongst the totalitarian gangsters- the Soviet Union, <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam- proves what I have always thought about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is true- I believe it is- how could we realistically expect help from the United States if we had a conflict of interests with <span class="highlight">China</span>, Japan, Indonesia or even India? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the drum beats in Asia and the murderous antics of the gang of three- the Soviet Union, <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam- are heard and noted by every Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Liberal and National Country parties were perfectly happy to distribute political pamphlets which, geographically, showed Australia very close to Asia and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think part of the difficulty that we face in this situation is the fact that the Australian people’s own regional isolation and European heritage have left us singularly ill-equipped as a community to understand the complex mix of historical, cultural, territorial and international factors that have led to the war currently raging between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam, and Vietnam and Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view, looking at what has occurred between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam and between Vietnam and Kampuchea, it is not possible to make the sorts of moral judgments that have been made in this House by the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You would be deaf, dumb, and mentally deficient not to recognise that there was a greater accord between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span> in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is perfectly true that Australia has increasing trade relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that our diplomatic and other relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> are improving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That of itself will increasingly exacerbate tensions between <span class="highlight">China</span> and both of her neighbours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who has been to <span class="highlight">China</span> knows that throughout <span class="highlight">China</span>, at almost every level and on almost every street there is concern and fear about an attack by the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally, one can understand that <span class="highlight">China</span> will be, and obviously is, concerned when it sees that in the communist world the Vietnamese are operating in an increasingly closer alliance with, and with an increasing dependence upon, the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One fact that must be looked at- Australia would be making a grave mistake if it ignored it-is that actions by <span class="highlight">China</span> have helped to produce that situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He mentioned that South East Asia is again the scene of armed conflict created by the hostility and rivalry existing amongst four states- the Soviet Union, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Vietnam and Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have thought that the whole of the Western world was interested in <span class="highlight">China</span>, if for no other reason than the resources it has that we hope to get and the goods we can sell to it in the process of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part of the conflict between Vietnam and <span class="highlight">China</span> revolves around who is going to control the oil that might be in the sea around that state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will it be <span class="highlight">China</span> or will it be Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He talked about the Vietnamese attack on Kampuchea as an attack by a client of the Soviet Union on a client of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever its motivation the attack bore directly on the rivalry and competition between the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>’s motives in striking across the border do not relate only to a border dispute but are aimed at Vietnam ‘s political influence in Kampuchea, which is beyond <span class="highlight">China</span>’s immediate reach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, <span class="highlight">China</span> wants to control something slightly beyond its reach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> was apparently offering considerable support but it withdrew its support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why has it encouraged Vietnam, in its conflict with <span class="highlight">China</span>, to seek refuge in the arms of the Soviet Union? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The events in Vietnam and Kampuchea are largely the continuation of a long historical struggle between the two countries and it is highly unlikely that any other country including <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union will become involved directly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the main problem areas of the Opposition is the continuing outflow of refugees from Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, and particularly from Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should recognise that many people of other than Chinese origin have sought to leave Vietnam and other countries of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question she was asked, which was not reported in the Press, was: As <span class="highlight">China</span> is having difficulty with respect to the payment of her overseas loans and overseas trade, what arrangements does she intend to make in relation to her modernisation program? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, she indicated that <span class="highlight">China</span> intended to engage in compensatory trade, which meant that those countries selling goods or technology to <span class="highlight">China</span> would be expected to buy back the products resulting from the manufacturing process in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has been invited and induced to engage in increased trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I suggest that a statement should be made setting out the conditions of trade between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span> as part of her modernisation program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> is reported to be negotiating overseas loans amounting to between $30,000m and $40,000m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are already reports that <span class="highlight">China</span> is proceeding very slowly with negotiating arrangements for paying back money invested in steel making and in many other overseas investments in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, evidence already exists that she has not sufficient oil with which to pay for investments in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The British have been exporting underground coal technology for <span class="highlight">China</span>’s mines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first proposal was that Britain ought to buy back some of the coal which would be developed as a result of the use of that technology in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that indicates the extend of the problem which <span class="highlight">China</span> has and will have in meeting a number of her commitments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, Thailand wanted to negotiate for oil in return for increased trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Thai Prime Minister stated in Moscow very recently that the oil from <span class="highlight">China</span> is not available to pay for Thai exports to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I suggest that a statement ought to be made by the Minister for Trade and Resources  (Mr Anthony)  and the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  setting out the terms of trade between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span> as dictated by <span class="highlight">China</span>’s lack of foreign exchange appropriate to the amount of trade that she desires for her modernisation program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The British Minister,  Mr Varley,  who has recently been in <span class="highlight">China</span>, will issue a statement on the nature of Britain’s trading agreement with <span class="highlight">China</span> in view of the fact that Australia has played a leading part in encouraging and in helping the modernisation program in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The trade agreement with <span class="highlight">China</span>, which entered into force on 1 June 1978 and provides for most-favoured-nation treatment, falls into the latter category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790320_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the House is aware, the Government has commissioned an intelligence assessment following recent unsettling events in the Middle East and in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> and its frontier with <span class="highlight">China</span> and elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It concerns current events in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the Minister also care to comment on the current status of negotiations between Vietnam and <span class="highlight">China</span> on the border dispute and on whether a protracted war is likely to continue as a guerrilla war in Kampuchea? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Dealing with the latter part of the question, the unstable situation in IndoChina continues to cause concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The easing of tensions which followed <span class="highlight">China</span>’s announcement that it would withdraw its troops from Vietnam has proved shortlived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These developments therefore make it less likely that immediate negotiations between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam will take place, although both sides earlier had agreed to negotiate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In regard to the second and very important element of the honourable member’s question concerning the possibility of further military force, I have to say that a further resort to military force by either Vietnam or <span class="highlight">China</span> simply cannot be ruled out if a total breakdown in negotiations were to occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, it has suspended some substantial contracts with Japan, I ask the Minister: What effects are <span class="highlight">China</span>’s second thoughts about development likely to have on Australia ‘s trade with that country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All told, I believe that there are no contracts under threat as a result of the reassessment of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Has his attention been drawn to the statements made by Chinese Vice Premier Madame Chen Muhua at the National Press Club that <span class="highlight">China</span>’s trade in its modernisation program will follow practices such as (a) compensatory payments, which she defined as being payments with the products of the enterprises and (b) delaying payments for equipment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790821_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-116-9">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government deliberately ignored the possibility of trade deals with both Iraq and <span class="highlight">China</span> although I noted recently that the Government is wavering on the issue of government-to-government negotiations, no doubt stung by the urgent realities of the situation facing Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The best example of that is the attitude of the leadership of this Government towards <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But if it was a question of providing some sort of an evaluation on what <span class="highlight">China</span> was doing throughout the world, no, it was absolutely out of its depth and it did not even have the books to rely on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They then went up the <span class="highlight">China</span> coast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What flows, however, and is implicit in the latter part of the honourable member’s question, and is implicit in a number of statements of members opposite- interestingly enough, not so much in the statement of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, more the statements of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate- is that there is a trend or tendency to have a bias towards Vietnam in discussions of Indo-Chinese questions concerning the conflict between Vietnam and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So, succinctly, the answer to the question is this: We would be most interested in a form of political settlement in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it were to be brought about by means of a conference we would do what we could to ensure the success of that conference but we would want to know in participating that people were well aware of the background to the current events in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> and did not allude to specious material and thereby draw the wrong conclusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Japan needs the raw materials and <span class="highlight">China</span> needs the technical assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The major point of my tour was to visit Vietnam to discuss with the Vietnamese Government the problems it is having with <span class="highlight">China</span> and then to go to <span class="highlight">China</span>, as the guest of the Chinese Government, to spend a fortnight in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore it is essential that the businessmen of Australia now take the opportunities that are available to them in the developing markets in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let it be not thought that <span class="highlight">China</span> is not very technically advanced in any field it so chooses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> today is certainly one of the world’s greatest powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Considering that today is <span class="highlight">China</span>’s national day, I think it would be polite of me to extend the good wishes of myself and all other honourable members who wish to associate with me to the ambassador for <span class="highlight">China</span> in this country when I go and see him in a moment, and ask him to convey my personal goodwill to the Government in Peking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there was a German buying mission there, they must have known that the tobacco of that part of <span class="highlight">China</span> is low in tar content and is also low in nicotine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, of course, any of the five permanent members- the United States of America, Britain, France, the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union- has the right of veto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I am aware of the gathering of forces- not to the extent that was evident earlier this year- on both sides of the border by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The prime element behind what is transpiring in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> is not restricted solely to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam, but in fact to the variants within the play of the four communist states- the Soviet Union, the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, Vietnam and, to a lesser extent because of its control by Vietnam, Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is quite clear is that the Australian Government was one of the very first- as it should have been because of our geographical position- to appreciate the fact that we had to take whatever action we could to alleviate the massive human suffering of the people of Kampuchea and, wherever possible, assist the border states such as Thailand which, as we are all aware, in the last two years in particular has been facing the enormous social and economic burden brought upon them by the refugees from all over Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, Laos, Vietnam and now Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The record which we have demonstrated in the last two years in terms of the problem of refugees from Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> speaks for itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although we are a nation of only 14.5 million people, we are among the foremost of nations of the western world which are absorbing refugees from Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ask for nothing more of Indo <span class="highlight">China</span> than that the people of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam should live as neighbours in a state of peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we are seeing today is the gradual but total destruction of the concept of sovereignty in Indo <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While that problem remains, we will face continually major difficulties in terms of the basic political stability of the region, not only of Indo <span class="highlight">China</span> but also of the entire area of South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As has been indicated here, great loss of life has occurred and is occurring in the former Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> area of Kampuchea- Cambodia as it was formerly known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the tragic days of Kissinger, Nixon, Foster Dulles and others, the idea was that we would be militarily involved in Vietnam on the basis that we were going to contain <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is no credit to <span class="highlight">China</span> for it to say that it wants to support Pol Pot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want the Government to talk to the representatives of <span class="highlight">China</span>, if need be, as to whether something cannot be done in the northern section of the province which is still under the control of the Khmer Rouge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The key to the situation is for our Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  to go straight away, this day, to the embassy representatives of Vietnam, <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia and talk about how we could go to Kampuchea with their support, both overt and covert, to see what we can organise for Phnom Penh and other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> and the Khmer Rouge, Vietnam and its puppet regime in Kampuchea have been prepared to allow their political differences to permit the sacrifice already of thousands of innocent citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has bis attention been drawn to the collapse of the Travel Agency, Sea-Air Travel (Glenelg South Australia) Pty Ltd affecting 23 persons who stand to lose most of the sum of about $1,800 that each paid for his or her tour to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We would have to go to the Soviet Union or <span class="highlight">China</span> to see a comparable concentration of media control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as regional policies are concerned, we consider the Government’s policy of taking sides in relation to the wars in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> to be destructive to regional security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Man  was born in Canton, <span class="highlight">China</span> on 29 August 1956. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My constituents tell me that before they entered the office of the Chinese solicitor another Chinaman was going in with $7,000 in cash to pay the solicitor for some litigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore suspect that that Chinaman was being exploited also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one hears of these things occurring in Australia one can well understand why the overwhelming population of <span class="highlight">China</span> sought another form of government under Mao Tse-tung. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some time ago a group of people with many years of experience in the field of emergency aid (Biafra, Sahel, Bangladesh, Indo <span class="highlight">China</span> refugees) were shocked when they were visiting the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to note that recently we have picked up spot contracts with Iran and <span class="highlight">China</span>, it is hoped, at good prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other new reference that the Committee is taking is one that looks at Australia and Asia and is entitled ‘The Changing Power Structure in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> since 1975, and its Effects on Australia and the Region’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Events in the IndoChina region are of major concern at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is the potential that the situation there may lead to further conflict between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam, which in turn could possibly involve the Soviet Union in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The changing power structure in IndoChina, the wars there and, more recently, the serious conflict in Kampuchea have been accompanied by the generation of an appalling refugee situation- a human tragedy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of this has put special demands on neighbouring states in the region of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> and has at last attracted world-wide attention to the plight of the refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The normal value assessed for dextrose monohydrate in Malaysia (converted at the appropriate rates of exchange at the date of assessment) was applied to exports of this product from the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-132">[More…]</a></p>
