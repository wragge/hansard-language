<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Whom does Australia recognise as the lawful government of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for External Affairs: Is it not the fact that the Australian Government is adopting the international attitude that the Government on the island of Taiwan is actually the Government not only of Taiwan but also of the whole of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our relationship with Red <span class="highlight">China</span> has been quite clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We trade with Red <span class="highlight">China</span> in certain commodities and under certain conditions in accordance with United Nations provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The short answer is, as I said earlier, that the Minister for External Affairs made a statement yesterday in the other place about Australia’s attitude to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> and I invite the Leader of the Opposition to read it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for External Affairs: ls it a fact that although Great Britain recognised Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> in 1949, in the 21 years since then Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> has refused to receive an ambassador from the United Kingdom on the ground that no ambassador will be received until the United Kingdom breaks off relations with Taiwan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he believe that in those circumstances the Australian Government could possibly consider destroying our relations with Taiwan and establishing relations with Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, which has treated the British diplomatic representative, the charge d’affaires, as a second class diplomatic representative and has refused under any circumstances to receive an ambassador? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The views expressed by  Senator McManns  about the United Kingdom’s affairs with Red <span class="highlight">China</span> are in accordance with my understanding of the position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for relations between the United Kingdom Government and Red <span class="highlight">China</span>, that is a matter for those 2 governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As 1 said in response to the series of questions by  Senator Murphy,  there can be no doubt that even though the United Kingdom Government and Red <span class="highlight">China</span> do have an understanding, this does not appear to have had any significant influence on the relationships between those 2 countries in the context of what  Senator McManus  said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How long is the nonsense of Australia’s trading heavily with mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> and yet refusing to recognise the existence of its government to go on? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ls it not a fact that many years ago the Government of Great Britain under Prime Minister  Sir Winston  Churchill recognised the existence of the Government of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How long are we to defy common sense by saying that the Government of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> is not the Government in Peking but is actually the Government in Taiwan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will not the Australian Government, for the sake of its citizens and to maintain any kind of dignity, follow the example of Canada and recognise the Government of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that Australia’s attitude to the recognition of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> has been clearly stated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Leader of the Government in the Senate ascertain from the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate whether the Australian Labor Party is in favour of selling wheat to Red <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any effects of the diplomatic recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span> by Canada on our sales of wheat to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> at this stage can be only pure conjecture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701016_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no evidence to suggest that <span class="highlight">China</span> will cut down its wheat imports from Australia or turn away from Australia as a source of supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701016_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Canada has been selling wheal to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> in pretty large quantities only since 1961 and Australia has had wheat markets in <span class="highlight">China</span> since before that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701016_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expressions of considerable concern have been made by people in the wheat industry and wheat growing areas throughout Australia about the likely loss to Canada of a considerable market for wheat in <span class="highlight">China</span> as a consequence of Canadia’s diplomatic recognition of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, coupled with problems created by the drought, the quota delivery scheme, the cost spiral and inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701016_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister immediately consult his colleague, the Minister for Trade and Industry, and attempt to negotiate a longterm wheat contract with the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> which would assist in getting the wheat growing industry off the hook? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701016_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time will he give the marketing authority an assurance that the Australian Government will support the application of <span class="highlight">China</span> for admission to the United Nations Organisation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701016_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having regard to the present price of wool, what would be the use of the rams in question either in Australia or in <span class="highlight">China</span>, or elsewhere? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the best of my knowledge, no wheat has been sold to <span class="highlight">China</span> in recent months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710401_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister any comment on a recent Japanese report on the Chinese economy which stated that <span class="highlight">China</span> will buy no wheat from Australia this year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710401_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate discussthe loss of wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> as a result of the attitude of the Government and the public statements of the Leader of the Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710407_senate_27_s47/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Could the Leader of the Government in the Senate or the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs explain whether the Australian Government still asserts internationally that the lawful government of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> is still the Government of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, which is situated on Taiwan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710420_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government inform the Senate how long this nonsense is going to continue of Australia pretending that the lawful government of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> is not the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, particularly as it has been recognised as such by even Conservative governments in Britain for over 20 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710420_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: In view of the recent statement by the Prime Minister that the Government intended to liberalise trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>, and having regard also to the statement made yesterday by the Deputy Prime Minister that he now supports recognition of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, does the Government now support what the Australian Labour Party is trying to do in opening up new initiatives with <span class="highlight">China</span>, or does the Government intend to display initiative especially in respect of trade and diplomatic relations with that nation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have any orders for the purchase of wheat been received this season from the Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister comment on a recent Japanese report on the economy of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> which stated that <span class="highlight">China</span> will buy no wheat from Australia this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there any truth in the story that  Dr Patterson,  the Labor shadow Minister for Primary Industry, may not go to <span class="highlight">China</span> because the Australian Labor Party is now very concerned over the great opposition by the Australian Wheat Industry and the Australian Wheat Board to bringing politics into wheat sales? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1 962 it was described as a mass organisation which, as I understand it, is a semi-official body not part pf the formal structure of the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is used as a convenient vehicle for communications to non-government bodies in foreign countries with which the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> wishes to communicate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the atmosphere of euphoria in the Press and in another quarter surrounding this matter can the Minister advise the Senate as to the identity and the authority of the body extending the recently publicised invitation to the Australian Labor Party for a delegation to visit Red <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has anything happened in the last day or so towards a normalisation of relations between Australia and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can it be expected that an atmosphere might eventually be created in which the Government of this country could take such further assertive initiatives as would lead to a total disengagement in Vietnam and recognition of continental <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He would probably incorporate the actual trading figures between Australia and mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Does the Minister recall a statement on <span class="highlight">China</span> by  Mr Patrick  Shaw, the Austraiian delegate to the United Nations, on 13th November 1968? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Prime Minister’s statement yesterday indicating a much more favourable attitude by the Australian Government towards <span class="highlight">China</span>, can the Minister advise the Senate of the changes in <span class="highlight">China</span>’s policy which justify the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When compiling the answer to the question asked by  Senator Buttfield  relative to trade with Taiwan and continental <span class="highlight">China</span>, will the Minister list the goods upon which trade is restricted with continental <span class="highlight">China</span> in order that a proper and realistic comparison can be made? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that in some figures which I have it is shown that Australia’s exports to the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in Taiwan have doubled in money value since 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Industry and has particular reference to those honourable senators who claim that Taiwan-Australia interests should be submerged for those of Red <span class="highlight">China</span> and Australia in the recognition of Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the United States ambassador in Taiwan has publicly predicted that Taiwan’s international trade volume may be equal to or in excess of that of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> in 2 or 3 years’ time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that, taking 1968 as a base year, Taiwan increased its international trade by 33 per cent last year and by 23.9 per cent in 1969 while mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> increased its trade by 6.3 per cent in 1969 and 5.8 per cent last year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister give similar figures for the volumes and growth rates of trade between Taiwan and Australia and Red <span class="highlight">China</span> and Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is well taken that  Mr Whitlam  will search in vain for an Opposition or a Leader of it in mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy President, I wish to take 2 minutes, if I may, to amplify a matter arising from a small misunderstanding which appears to have resulted from a question that I asked this morning in relation to the proposed visit of an Australian Labor Party delegation to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>POLO, MARCO (1254-1324), Venetian traveller, whose descriptions of his journeys across the world from Venice to <span class="highlight">China</span> and back, and of his experiences in the vast dominions of the Mongol emperor Kublai, make one of the greatest books of a time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its author was the first to inform the West of the extent and power of <span class="highlight">China</span>- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What factual evidence is there that Francis James was detained or is still being detained in the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710520_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that Australia is allowing the importation of millions of plastic bags from places in the East such as Hong Kong and <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of consistent reports of potential markets for Australian produce in <span class="highlight">China</span>, what endeavours have been made or are contemplated by the Department of Trade and industry to assess such market potential, particularly for dairy produce and dried fruits, which are affected by the loss of British markets? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is hoping for an expansion of Australian-Chinese contacts at all levels and a visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> by the Australian Women’s Basketball Team would fit in well with this, but again it was for the Council to decide whether to arrange such a tour or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even though the wheat was sold to <span class="highlight">China</span> last December, shipment started in January and wil continue until October this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This sale of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> has helped tremendously in shifting a lot of the surplus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This sale to <span class="highlight">China</span>, however, does not alleviate the financial problem because, as I have pointed out, the money will not be recouped in full until October next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Anthony), details of the prices at which Australian wheat was being sold, particularly to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We claimed that the sale of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> raised problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told that it was necessary that wheat be sold to <span class="highlight">China</span> to keep the industry on its feet and for the purposes of overseas exchange. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After I had been told on numerous occasions that the Wheat Board could not permit the prices at which it was selling wheat to be known because our competitors would be advantaged - Canada was mentioned particularly  -  I wrote to the Canadian High Commissioner and asked him would he have any objection to letting me have complete details of the prices and so on at which Canada sold its wheat to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>.I received a lot of documents containing all possible information from Canada, which made it rather obvious to me that the situation of fear of competition was phoney unless our wheat was being sold at prices which could not bear the light of day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next thing that happened was that I was informed by 2 or 3 economists at Australian universities that they knew the prices at which Australian wheat was being sold to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances my Party ceased to talk about Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> and we devoted ourselves to trying to ward off the calamity that was due to happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am going to ask one question in conclusion: Why are we not told the prices at which wheat is being sold to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has already been said that Australia is selling wheat .to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> at prices lower than those for sales being made to India and countries which are friendly disposed towards us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By 1960 and up to 1965 stocks were at a low level as a result of restriction on acreages in the United States and the large purchases made at that time by <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our largest purchaser of wheat is the Peoples Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> which will take from us this year 88 million bushels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, observations are made and remarks passed such as the Senate heard from  Senator McManus  who would rather see a situation such as this than the selling of wheat to Red <span class="highlight">China</span>, even though Red <span class="highlight">China</span> is one customer of ours which has been able to pay its way, according to the Wheat Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No report has been made to show that <span class="highlight">China</span> is not a very good customer of ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator O’Byrne, in an attack on  Senator McManus,  said that all we proposed to do was to prevent the sale of wheat to Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who analyse this situation, and particularly the stand of the Australian Democratic Labor Party on it, must realise that our attitude towards sales of wheat to Red <span class="highlight">China</span> has nothing to do with the political attitude of Red <span class="highlight">China</span> in itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of the arguments we have put forward over the years in relation to this matter have been an endeavour to protect the Australian wheat industry against the excesses in which it was being persuaded to indulge by the false market that was being created by selling wheat to Red <span class="highlight">China</span> at prices below those at which we had been selling to our recognised markets such as India. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe also that the refusal to disclose the price at which the wheat was being sold to Red <span class="highlight">China</span> besmirched the name of this country throughout the world and raised serious doubts as to whether we were meeting our international commitments in relation to the agreed price for wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We further set out to show that there was an over-expansion of the industry brought about by the twin evils of the guaranteed price and the expectation of unlimited markets - the vision splendid created by the Wheat Board which set out to get contracts for our wheat from Red <span class="highlight">China</span> at prices below those at which it was selling to other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our criticism of the undue development of the wheat industry in this country to meet the requirements of the market in Red <span class="highlight">China</span>, in particular, was not based on the political quality of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the very early days of this trade we carried a resolution at our federal conference to the effect that where it could be shown that a country such as Red <span class="highlight">China</span> was suffering from a famine or anything of that nature and had a tremendous need for our wheat, every opportunity should be taken to see that the requirements and needs of that country were met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has been the Government’s excuses for not producing to the Parliament of Australia the prices at which it has been prepared to negotiate wheat sales to Red <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The DLP is the one Party which has been absolutely opposed to a diversity of market outlets in its attitude to sales to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly if we had not made sales to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> there would have been no complaint if the Canadian Government had sold wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certain that the Canadian Government would be very pleased at this time to be able to sell wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>, which is quite a valuable market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Originally when I first heard of this it was a question of the Democratic Labor Party refusing to sell wheat to Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I say Red <span class="highlight">China</span>, I mean the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should we sell wheat to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> at a lower price even though it may be second class or third class wheat? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that we are selling more cheaply to Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that the price paid by <span class="highlight">China</span> is known, but the quality of the wheat, the insurance costs, the extra costs, interest rates and so on are not known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I heard one honourable senator say that Canada disclosed the price at which it sells wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Canada has never disclosed the price at which it sells wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Acting Minister for External Affairs see in the Sydney Press on Sunday last a statement by Miss Anne Deveson drawing attention to an English newspaper article about the missing Australian journalist, Francis James, and staling ‘whilst James languishes in gaol, somewhere on the mainland of <span class="highlight">China</span>, nobody in Australia seems to be doing much to help him’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Australia is now the fourth largest trader amongst the countries of the world with mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, I ask the Minister: Should we not be able to secure reliable information as to the whereabouts of this Australian journalist? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The buyers who were present at this sale of 50 rams came from South Africa, the Argentine, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Haly and Rumania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Argentina purchased 10 rams; Brazil purchased 10 rams; mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> purchased 1 1 rams; India purchased 3 rams; Italy purchased1 ram; Rumania purchased 9 rams; and South Africa purchased 3 rams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely if that happens in Australia where we have our fine merino wools all over the place there will be the same result in South Africa, America, Uruguay, mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> or wherever else they go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite obvious that a conflict is rising among the lower echelons as to whether people from mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> can continue to be the rulers or whether people born in Formosa should be given their opportunity to rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 know there was a time when thestock in trade of the Government, as stated by  Sir Robert  Menzies, was the talk about preventing the downward thrust of <span class="highlight">China</span> between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has some kind of reason for this, of course, because Pakistan has allied itself with Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, the South Vietnamese Government did not sign the Geneva agreement, nor did the United States, Australia, Britain, Russia or <span class="highlight">China</span> because the agreement was not drawn up for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was more than an insurgency; it was an actual aggression, and that actual aggression is taking place in Cambodia at the present time by the North Vietnamese, lt is taking place in Laos and it represents an overall threat to lndo-<span class="highlight">China</span> from Communist forces based in Hanoi. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If it is Communist aggression, as  Senator Greenwood  says it is, why then does he not go to his Country Party colleagues and talk about the export of wheat to continental <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it is continental <span class="highlight">China</span> when it is referred to in trade areas and Red <span class="highlight">China</span> when it is referred to on a political level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only thing that  Senator Greenwood  is doing in trying to enhance his Government is to take the eyes of the Australian people and this Parliament away from what his Government is doing in the war in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, what it is doing in its whole foreign policy and the attitude it is taking to the dangers of the developing situation that we have in South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We see that Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> is also rumbling in the same direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We call for the withdrawal of Australian troops from Vietnam because we believe that a continuation of Australian participation in this war is wrong, first of all because of the bloodshed which is taking place as a result of our intervention, secondly because of the hypocrisy with which every action of this Government in this struggle has been tainted, and thirdly because of the total stupidity of this Government and of the United States Administration in the policies which they have followed in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Cambodia, another part of the former French empire in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, has been ruled with brilliant but erratic skill by Prince Sihanouk, the king turned politician, but towards the end of 1963, the prince seemed to have decided that in time <span class="highlight">China</span> was going to rule over everybody anyway, and asked the United States to drop its aid programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I draw the Senate’s attention to the fact that this Moratorium is designed to disrupt the Australian community, so it is typical of the Communist philosophy that has been followed in <span class="highlight">China</span> and through Europe and elsewhere during the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that he is now going to oppose the sale of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> which is being organised by the Minister for Trade and Industry  (Mr McEwen),  who is the Leader of the Australian Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Webster  told us this afternoon that anybody who does anything to assist <span class="highlight">China</span> is a traitor to his country, and as the Leader of his Party is selling wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>, I have no doubt that  Senator Webster  includes him in that category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the context in which he said that, he was asserting that the Russianflag and the flag of <span class="highlight">China</span> have more respect throughout the world than the Australian flag. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-54-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Kingdom of Cambodia, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, France, the Kingdom of Laos, the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, the State of Vietnam, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom and the United States were represented at that conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the Australian Government understands the matter, neither the authorities of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> nor the government of the Republic  of  <span class="highlight">China</span> accepts any formula  of  recognition which would deny its claim to sovereignty over both the Chinese mainland and the island of Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable senator knows, Australia accords de jure recognition to the government  of  the Republic  of  <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the encouragement and support given by some members of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party to the North Vietnamese, Vietcong and aggressive Communist imperialism, and acknowledging that <span class="highlight">China</span> and Romania have purchased rams and that the Soviet Union has expressed interest in purchasing rams, will the Minister draw the attention of trade unions to the fact that the ban is opposed to the principle of solidarity of Communist powers expressed by some members of the Australian Labor Party and sections of the Australian trade union movement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For some years Australia has been finding a small outlet for its wheat by selling to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet we have gone through the absolute charade of refusing to recognise these people and to send our most vigorous trading people up there to see whether <span class="highlight">China</span> is willing to buy more of our primary products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mention was made today of what we should be doing in relation to selling wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister seen a report in the ‘Australian’ that <span class="highlight">China</span> will give military aid to supporters of Prince Sihanouk in their fight against the present Government of Cambodia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700820_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> has been providing assistance to North Vietnam for a long time in support of its aggressive aims throughout Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700820_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an area of conflict between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There must always be a question mark  about future Ceylonese policies, particularly in relation to <span class="highlight">China</span> because any change there would certainly not be welcomed by India. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Soviet has also been providing substantial military support to India to counter the threat from <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned before, I do not think we should become too obsessed with Russia because, in the long term, it may well be that <span class="highlight">China</span> will present a greater threat than the Soviet Union in the Indian Ocean area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already <span class="highlight">China</span> has strong influences in Pakistan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the change of government in Ceylon, <span class="highlight">China</span> may well have some influence there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> has strong influences in Tanzania and Somalia, particularly in Somalia, in conflict with the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also <span class="highlight">China</span> is not unaware of the Persian Gulf area where today Russia is exercising strong influences as the British withdraw. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we find <span class="highlight">China</span> taking an active interest in this area and, in many portions of it, in conflict with the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly - and I do not put these points in any order of priority - she wishes to counter the influence of <span class="highlight">China</span> and establish for herself a leadership role in the cause of underdeveloped countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important that at some stage we should give a good deal of thought to the Russian objective of countering the influence of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe 1 should mention in this very brief review 2 factors influencing SinoSoviet relations, lt is very obvious that the Soviet Union has no wish to see <span class="highlight">China</span> expand her influence in Africa or Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He referred to the growing influence of <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia in South and South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He stated that a fear about security does exist and that it concerns an awakened and determined <span class="highlight">China</span>, aspiring to achieve a super-power status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Doctor T. B. Millar of the Australian National University, writing in a publication of the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre entitled Soviet Policies in the Indian Ocean area’, referred to Russia’s fear of <span class="highlight">China</span> expanding her influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Soviet Union is aware of the strong fears of <span class="highlight">China</span> held in South and South East Asia, and it is entirely logical that she should seek to exploit these in order to limit Chinese influence in the area, increase her own influence and with a minimum outlay strengthen the military capacity of the states on <span class="highlight">China</span>’s southern boundary at a time when the Sino-Soviet border is under dangerous tension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have from 2 authorities a recognition that Russia is concerned with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Russia obviously has a fear of <span class="highlight">China</span> expanding its influence into the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore Russia in the event of any conflict with <span class="highlight">China</span> may well want to use the Indian Ocean as a thoroughfare for the movement of supplies to the eastern part of Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to return again to what is germane to this debate, that is, our relations with various countries, I was very intrigued when  Senator Sim  developed a thesis about a possible world struggle between the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the final crunch comes the Soviet Union will go along with <span class="highlight">China</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister seen an open letter from the intellectuals of Cambodia to intellectual friends throughout the world in which they solemnly accuse the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese, as well as their mentor, the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, of trying to erase Cambodia and the Cambodian people from the face of the world? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700827_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Considering the above, we solemnly accuse the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese as well as their mentor, the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, of trying to erase Cambodia and the Cambodian people from the face of this world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Production in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, <span class="highlight">China</span> and eastern European countries together amounted to 21 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> and India are already buyers of our wool. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact, <span class="highlight">China</span> is now rated sixth in the world of Australian export. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not rely on droughts in <span class="highlight">China</span> or the Soviet Union; we should be looking for other areas in which to dispose of our surplus wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the majority of the nations represented at the United Nations believe that <span class="highlight">China</span> should be represented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the follies of our time, and one of the things that I had in mind when I referred to the polarisation of ideas which exists in the United Nations, is that people are not considering the inclusion of Red <span class="highlight">China</span> on the basis of reason and logic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not know the actual serial number of his Liberal Party ticket, but I am quite convinced that if  Senator Young  or any other member of the Government parties wanted to table a list of this nature this would be looked upon as being in the general realm of pimping, lt is significant that the list should have been mentioned by  Senator Young,  one of the better known South Australian wheat producers, who earns additional profits over and above his parliamentary salary by growing wheat to sell to North Vietnam through mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has followed up all reports, and enquiries have been made on the assumption that reports of  Mr James  being in <span class="highlight">China</span> have some substance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>in Australia - it is the policy of the Government - are in association with our allies to help the free , people of South Vietnam to preserve their freedom against the cruel and wicked invaders from North Vietnam who are being aided, .supported and for the most part directed by Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are markets available in Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been particularly stubborn in failing to realise the potential markets in <span class="highlight">China</span> for many of our primary products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another section of our foreign policy in which there is large scale deception is that which involves Chiang Kai Shek and the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last night I mentioned mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> and spoke of the attitude that the Government has taken to trade with that country and to acknowledging the position of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> in relation to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s attitude has created in <span class="highlight">China</span> an hostility towards Australia, even though the Chinese have been purchasing a considerable amount of our wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Externa) Affairs aware of Malaysia’s new Prime Minister’s call for the neutralisation of South East Asia with guarantees from the Soviet Union, the United States and <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there was any doubt about what many of us said before that campaign it was made quite apparent by the Moratorium itself because on that day in the various capital cities of Australia we saw processions and marches under Vietcong flags, under Communist flags and under the flag of Red <span class="highlight">China</span>, but a United States flag or an Australian flag was scarcely to be seen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all of this the objective to be achieved was the success of Communist forces in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> by the withdrawal of United States and allied troops. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In lndoChina they want the war stopped not on terms that the South Vietnamese should have what all people should have - the right of self-determination - but on conditions that will enable the people of North Vietnam, the Vietcong and those who back and support them to overrun a group of independent and free people and to impose their own regime on those free people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Australian Minister for Externa] Affairs state that the present Australian Government would not change its attitude to the recognition of Red <span class="highlight">China</span>  whilst the Government of that country would not recognise the Declaration of Human Rights and whilst Red <span class="highlight">China</span> continued to assert that it intends to pursue its political policies by the use of force? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the apparent intense interest of and the several questions asked by the Leader of the Opposition in this place indicate that, in the remote possibility of a change of political control of this Parliament, a government of Labor complexion would support Red <span class="highlight">China</span> in its rejection of the Declaration of Human Rights and would also support a policy of force to achieve its political ends? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have stated - the Prime Minister has recently confirmed this and I now confirm it again - that of course we would like Red <span class="highlight">China</span> to be in the United Nations provided only that it accepted the Declaration of Human Rights and abided by it and provided it was willing to abide by the principles of the Charter itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The condition would be that Red <span class="highlight">China</span> renounced the use of violence and force in an attempt to ensure its political objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, we have stated that if Red <span class="highlight">China</span> does live up to its obligations we would be prepared to reconsider our position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing Minister for External Affairs aware that there is already a form of relationship between Australia and Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> in that  Mr Ted  Hill, the head of the pro-Chinese Australian Communist Party Marxist-Leninist is received, on his regular visits to <span class="highlight">China</span>, with the honours normally accorded an Australian ambassador or head of state, with full red carpet treatment and with a member of Cabinet to receive him? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this not indicate the attitude of Red <span class="highlight">China</span> to Australia and the forum of diplomatic association with us that Red <span class="highlight">China</span> prefers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: Is it not a fact that the Australian Government and the Australian Department of Trade and Industry have frequently used United Kingdom representation in Peking to facilitate the present trading arrangements of the Australian Government with Red <span class="highlight">China</span>, by which various officials of the Commonwealth Trading Bank and the Commonwealth Department of Trade and Industry have visited Red <span class="highlight">China</span>, been welcomed there and arranged certain trade deals in respect of wheat and other commodities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other part of my question is this: Is it correct that in recent times Australia has sold to the Government of Red <span class="highlight">China</span> many hundreds of millions of dollars worth of wheat and other rural commodities, that it has permitted the sale to the Government of Red <span class="highlight">China</span> of steel, zinc and other strategic materials in appreciable quantities and that it intends to continue trading with the Government of Red <span class="highlight">China</span> and to continue permitting Australian persons and companies also to trade with the Government of Red <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bypassing the light hearted approach at the commencement of  Senator Murphy’s  question, it is true that Australia sells wheat and other commodities to Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government seriously suggest that if <span class="highlight">China</span> has aggressive aims which must be resisted by Australia, these aggressive aims would be advanced more by Australia having an embassy in Peking than they are by the extensive sales of Australian goods to that country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been no change in the Government’s attitude in relation to the establishment of diplomatic relations with Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the question addressed by me to the Leader of the Government in the Senate relating to the inference which a reasonable person might draw from the question raised by the Leader of the Opposition regarding the apparent desire of the Opposition to recognise Red <span class="highlight">China</span> and its present external policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today has particular significance because an aerial bomb explosion took place in mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst I am on my feet, if I may, with your permission,  Mr Deputy President,  I wish to mention that at question time today I answered 2 questions asked by  Senator Murphy  about trade with Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We see the outlet for our wheat in Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> being threatened now because the Canadian Government considers it practicable to recognise Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present the Canadian Government is negotiating with <span class="highlight">China</span> for an extension of the arrangements between the 2 countries for the sale of wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are now within 2 weeks of the end of this month, at which time the arrangments which enable us to sell 82 million tons of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> are due to expire, yet nothing has been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as I can gather from the Press and from statements that have been made we have done nothing at all to renew our contract with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then he wanders off on to the subject of wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> and the dairying industry, saying nothing constructive whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator O’Byrne  believes that all of our problems will be solved if we recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If she wanted them she would buy them from Australia because <span class="highlight">China</span> will buy where she can best. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a policy which <span class="highlight">China</span> is herself engaged in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Industry been drawn to a report in the ‘Australian’ under the heading ‘Tougher Stance on Wheat by <span class="highlight">China</span>’ which refers to a United States report, issued in Washington, that <span class="highlight">China</span> is harvesting record crops and will this year export more primary produce than she imports? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this not place <span class="highlight">China</span> in a stronger position with respect to her balance of trade? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not be in a position - I do not suppose anybody would be - to make a considered judgment on the implications of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s productivity and her exports as related to her imports of wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 15th October, a fortnight ago, I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Industry a pertinent question about trade with mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now ask the Minister whether the delay in replying to my question has been caused by the fact that senior officers of the Department of Trade and Industry have been directed to carry out research for the Government’s Senate election campaign, or whether it is a fact that no figures are kept of trade between Australia and mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Russia - if I may call ii an Asian country - <span class="highlight">China</span>, Japan and so on are importing great amounts of our raw materials or primary products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Growers sell their wheat to the Australian Wheat Board which sends it to various parts of the world - whether it be mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> or Rhodesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many farmers to whom I spoke asked me when the Australian Government is to recognise mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, and how much longer this Government is to ignore the huge market that exists there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not referring to members of the Labor Party who are constantly being told that we cannot recognise mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> because it has a Communist Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only a few days ago reports appeared in the Australian Press that Canada has recognised and established diplomatic relations with the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A few days after those reports were published Canada negotiated the sale to the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> of wheat valued at $160m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The time has long past when we should have recognised the Government of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Industry, ls it a fact that mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> has not yet renewed its order for Australian wheat and that it is now 2 months after the normal ordering date? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it correct that Canada received an order for wheat from mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> which was 10 per cent larger than the usual order after Canada accorded Peking diplomatic recognition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these are facts - perhaps the Minister will indicate if they are nol - will he tell us for how much longer the Australian Government will maintain the fiction that the 700 million or 800 million people in mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> are represented by the Chiang Kai-shek Government in Taiwan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What are the current value and quantity figures for the following Australian exports to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> during the year ended 30 June 1970; (a) wheat, (b) other grains, (c) wool, (d) beef, (e) other rural products, (0 minerals, (g) machinery, (h) chemicals, (i) weapons, steel, ammunition and similar products? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-83-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Exports of these items from Australia to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> during the year ended 30 June 1970, were as follows. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-83-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some people say that we will be able to get out of our plight if there is a drought in Russia or if we are able to sell more wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> if that country has a bad year of production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While we seem to be keen to sell our wheat to these people, in the world councils, we are never keen to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some say that because Canada has recognised <span class="highlight">China</span> it has sold a very large parcel of what to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet he comes into this chamber and supports selling <span class="highlight">China</span> steel that comes back in bullets in Vietnam and he and all his colleagues are worried that they will not be able to sell further wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister inform the Parliament whether only inferior grain, which is unsaleable elsewhere, was in fact being sold to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> and whether the statement by the Minister for External Territories has contributed to the apparent loss of this market? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware that the Australian Wheat Board does not sell only inferior wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> sought that wheat because it had use for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is the Minister still confident that the Australian Wheat Board will increase its wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> over last year’s sales as he predicted in reply to a question from  Senator O’Byrne  on 16th October 1970? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What evidence does the Minister have, if any, of <span class="highlight">China</span> resuming imports of Australian wheat? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is true that at this stage <span class="highlight">China</span> has not renewed the contract for wheat purchases that it has made normally about this time over many years past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, I still believe that <span class="highlight">China</span> will come to Australia looking for wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> knows, as do other nations, that there is a big surplus of wheat in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to the honourable senator that <span class="highlight">China</span> has carried out wheat negotiations with and made wheat purchases from Canada for many years past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Canada recognises mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> and, according to reports, Canada this year has received an order for $70m worth of wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-88-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Liaison Committee of Peace Forces in Vietnam proclaims that: The action of landing troops to intrude into Laotian territory violated rudely the Geneva Agreement of 1954 on Indo <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Geneva Agreement of 1962 on L;os, and seriously violated the international laws on the principle of respecting the territory of any nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710401_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The action of sending Vietnamese troops into Laos in order to decrease the loss of American forces, as is  President  Nixon’s declaration, reveals the submissive nature of Nguyen Van Thieu’s government, using the lives of Vietnamese young men as cannon fodder for the American expeditionary soldiers in Indo <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710401_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether the Government is aware that one condition of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>’s entry to the United Nations on which Peking has indicated it would insist is that it receive the same right of veto as certain major powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710407_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would be the attitude of the Australian Government to investing Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> with this power completely and at will to nullify operations of the United Nations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710407_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well known that Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> insists that it be recognised as <span class="highlight">China</span> for the purpose of entry into the United Nations, from which it would acquire the right of veto that was accorded by the treaty to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710407_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Minister for External Territories, during the Senate campaign in November 1970, stale at a public meeting on the Queensland Gold Coast that  he  was not perturbed at the loss of the Mainland Chinese market for Australian wheat as in any case Australia was only disposing of its inferior wheat to that country; if so, is only inferior grain, which is unsaleable elsewhere, being sold to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> and has the statement by the Minister for External Territories contributed to the apparent loss of this market? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710407_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall therefore confine my statement to four questions of particular current interest and importance to Australia, Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Middle East and Pakistan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710407_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs consider it a good portent for proposals for Australian recognition of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> that Great Britain recognised Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> in 1949 and in all the period since then Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> has refused to receive a British Ambassador? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710420_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, will the Government consider asking Mao Tsc-tung, in view of his invitation to ping-pong teams to enter <span class="highlight">China</span>, his views on the entry into Australia of a South African cricket team because Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> so obviously does not believe in mixing politics and sport? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710420_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Acting Minister for Primary Industry whether he is aware of a statement in today’s Press attributed to the Leader of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation,  Mr Price,  in which he criticised the Australian Country Party, the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party in that order for their approach to the vital question of international trade as it relates to wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> and stated that they were guilty of national irresponsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the question of wheat trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> is a matter which has interested many sections of the community, and many people have had a lot to say ‘ on the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think it should be made clear that at no time has any official Chinese source said that the recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span> is a prerequisite for trade with that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a tribute to the magnificent work of the Australian Wheat Board that the current year’s sales are of record dimensions without sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> and reflect a great widening of the market? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This year we have been able to make sales all over the world and to sell sufficient wheat to give us an estimated carry-over of well below 200 million bushels without sales to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Acting Minister for Primary Industry: Is it not a fact that the considerable sales of wheat to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> in recent years were made possible because it was the policy of the United States of America, which has immense wheat production, not to sell wheat to that country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it true that people who are endeavouring to bring about recognition of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> by forecasting possible sales of Australian wheat to that country as a result of recognition would have to take into consideration the fact that the United States, with its immense production, could become a competitor? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite likely if Australia recognised Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> in order to get into this wheat trade, then possibly America, with its great surplus, would have to look to this market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>President Eisenhower, speaking at a Governors’ Conference, gave a very practical reason for American concern in the fate of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Now let us assume that we lose Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> goes, several things happen right away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are voting for the cheapest way that we can prevent the occurrence of something that would be of most terrible significance to the United States of America, our security our power and ability to get certain things we need from the riches of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> and from South East Asia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Vietnam war is not for the so-called defeat of Communism in Asia but to ensure that the capitalists of Australia and the United States have uncontrolled access to the riches of Indo <span class="highlight">China</span> and, as I said in this chamber a week or so ago, to the possible oil fields off the shores of South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Eisenhower said that if Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> fell that piece of land would be forgotten and the last great populated area would fall to the Kremlin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has survived on this myth of the Communists of the Kremlin and <span class="highlight">China</span> raping women, of red arrows coming down and this type of thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That it is in the best interests of Australia that we should immediately recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is not <span class="highlight">China</span> itself; it is really Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is the recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>, which is completely separate from the question of its taking a seat at the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sorry that members of the Australian Democratic Labor Party are having a party meeting because I hoped to persuade them that they could support the first matter, the recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>, without getting too hot under the collar over its having 2 seats at the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, we have to deal with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no problem facing Australians who wish to enter <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> is a country in its own right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But for some unknown reason the Government turns a blind eye when it comes to <span class="highlight">China</span> because <span class="highlight">China</span> is Communist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one goes to <span class="highlight">China</span> one realises what happy people the Chinese are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we will find that the ping-pong players from America and Australia who are visiting <span class="highlight">China</span> will confirm what I say upon their return. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the business people who freely enter <span class="highlight">China</span> agree wilh what I say, that is, that the Chinese are a happy people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one is in <span class="highlight">China</span> and mentions this the people laugh and say: ‘Where is Australia?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> will not advance this way because she is Communist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not hear any more statements about the Communists coming down here from <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is immature of the Government, Ministers and members of Parliament to keep on referring to <span class="highlight">China</span> as continental <span class="highlight">China</span>, Red <span class="highlight">China</span> or any other <span class="highlight">China</span> you like except the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, which is the name the Chinese have chosen for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is a country of 700 million people, if not 800 million. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the kingdom of <span class="highlight">China</span> and they were Chinese people who migrated there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1887 the Chinese Government declared Taiwan to be a province of <span class="highlight">China</span>, but unfortunately in the war with Japan, in 1895, <span class="highlight">China</span> had to cede Taiwan to Japan and Taiwan became Formosa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no-one in <span class="highlight">China</span> or among what are called the old <span class="highlight">China</span> hands who will not agree that Chiang Kai-shek was one of the most successful of the corrupt warlords of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was able to go there because when the war ended and Japan was defeated Formosa was handed over to the Nationalist Government that was in power in <span class="highlight">China</span> at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Formosa was given to <span class="highlight">China</span> as a trust and nothing was determined as to what should happen to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are Taiwanese, and no-one knows whether they want to go back to Red <span class="highlight">China</span>, as the Government calls it, or whether they want to stay with Chiang Kai-shek’s <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said so frequently in this chamber, if Chiang Kai-shek, as he says he will do every year, did land on <span class="highlight">China</span> with 3 divisions, 2 of them would desert him immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They believe in <span class="highlight">China</span> and want to go back to <span class="highlight">China</span>, so much so that there is a Formosan Liberation Independence League which we should be supporting as we support the people in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of no use for the Government to say that we have an independent policy in regard to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may have been incidental that American ping pong players went into <span class="highlight">China</span> and then our ping pong players went into <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Americans suddenly say: ‘We will relax trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>,’ and then Australia says: ‘We will relax trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pointing out that the Government said yesterday or the day before - I forget which - that it would relax trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why the Government will not recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I come now to the question of trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not be crying all the way to <span class="highlight">China</span> that we must have her support - that she must buy our wheat to keep our country people on the land and buy our wool to help our country people and to keep the Country Party viable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if we recognise <span class="highlight">China</span> first, trade will follow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people are worried that if we recognise <span class="highlight">China</span> Taiwan will suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether <span class="highlight">China</span> should be admitted to the United Nations and Taiwan expelled is known as the Albanian question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia supports the view that a two-thirds majority vote is required on the question of whether <span class="highlight">China</span> can be admitted and Taiwan expelled because it is an important question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the October sittings of the United Nations only 8 countries need to change sides and vote for the inclusion of <span class="highlight">China</span> on this important issue and the important issue is gone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then it becomes a simple majority question as to the admission of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the expulsion of Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of worrying about the inevitable recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span> the Taiwanese should be trying to foster enough friends to ensure that they keep a United Nations seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taiwan should be busy seeing how it can retain its seat, rather than worrying about <span class="highlight">China</span>’s getting on to the committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that we should be helping our friends and seeing that <span class="highlight">China</span> gains a place in the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A question of principle is involved in not recognising Red <span class="highlight">China</span> but it is disappearing with America’s acceptance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should get to know <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators cannot know <span class="highlight">China</span> if they have not been there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Six years ago after I had returned from <span class="highlight">China</span> I said in this chamber that the first thing we should do is to send a parliamentary delegation there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This should be done so that we can get to know <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course <span class="highlight">China</span> shows the best when we go there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A delegation of all members of Parliament, including members of the Australian Democratic Labor Party should go to <span class="highlight">China</span> and see for themselves what is going on there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The one issue is that we should recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The point is that they have a day in <span class="highlight">China</span>, whatever the honourable senator may like to call that <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Subsequently <span class="highlight">China</span>, has continued to lend support for the North Korean regime which sought to reunite that peninsula by force of arms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> has declared its active support for the so-called war of national liberation of the Indo-Chinese people, a term which includes the military conflicts in Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently Peking referred to the struggle in the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> peninsula, a geographical term which might possibly be taken as including Thailand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> has called for a people’s war in Burma and has given support to insurgents in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of India too, the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> engaged in military conflict to assert its border claims against India. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More recently <span class="highlight">China</span> has adopted a more constructive foreign policy and has sought to increase its international support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this record of hostile intent and hostile practice does not suggest that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is yet willing to live in peace with its neighbours or to adopt genuinely constructive policies towards them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then stated that <span class="highlight">China</span> had acquired some greater international support and was showing more interest in representation in the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said that as a result Australia had its policies towards <span class="highlight">China</span> under review, and in this respect we were consulting closely with the United States of America, Japan and other friendly nations which have also had their policies under review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Action of this kind would also be foolish because it would not be likely to lead to any changes in <span class="highlight">China</span>’s aims and the means by which it has chosen to achieve them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further point that I wish to make is that for the last 20 years the Government of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in Taiwan has shown itself to be able to live up to its international obligations within the United Nations and elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would indeed weaken our credibility amongst Asian countries if we were unilaterally to recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> without seeking protection for the status and rights of the people of Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot concur in action that would leave 14 million people - more than the population of Australia - to face Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> without recognition or the support of friends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me improbable that the people of Taiwan would wish to come under the dominance of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly substantially higher than that of the people of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What lessons would the small Asian countries that border <span class="highlight">China</span> draw from such an abandonment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  explained in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, the Government believes that the immediate problem for examination is not recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> but its possible admission to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that respect it is appropriate to advert to what fell  -  I think without any consideration at all - from  Senator Turnbull’s  lips when he referred to the Albanian resolution for the expulsion of Taiwan and the admission of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know how anybody who adheres to the constitution of the United Nations could seriously contravert that it is an important question within the terms of Article 18. particularly when the proposition from Albania was to exclude Taiwan and admit mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Turnbull dropped from his original proposal any reference to the sending of a parliamentary delegation to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that the Australian Labor Party is not so ardently keen upon sending representation to <span class="highlight">China</span>, whether it be in the form of  Dr Patterson  or of a parliamentary delegation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody who suggests a parliamentary delegation to <span class="highlight">China</span> at present shows that he has an absence of knowledge of the conditions there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should remember, too, that there is no real equivalent of our Parliament in <span class="highlight">China</span> and that the institutions of the People’s Republic are in a state of disarray after the cultural revolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, the Australian Government has never sought to stand in the way of private individuals or associations which have sought to travel to the People’s Republic pf <span class="highlight">China</span> for legitimate purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Turnbull  wishes to travel to <span class="highlight">China</span> - as he has avowed and I confirm - he can apply for a visa and no obstacles will be placed in his way by the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been treated to a speech by the Minister for Works  (Senator Wright)  which has been provocative and insulting towards the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope - and I would suggest - that no-one should take those provocative remarks made by the Minister as illustrating the official attitude of Australia or even of the Government towards the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motion is based on the proposition that it is in the best interests of Australia to recognise immediately the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For more than 20 years there has been a People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should have recognised the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> at the commencement of those 20 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that Australia will recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and it will not be very long before it does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is in the best interests of Australia to recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is that the Australian Government is maintaining that the lawful government of the whole of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> as well as Taiwan, well over 800 million people, is the Chiang Kai-shek Government on the island of Taiwan, the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The international claim by both the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> on Taiwan is that there is only one <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are both adamant that there is one <span class="highlight">China</span> and one only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whom does Australia recognise as the ‘lawful government of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Australian Government understands the matter, neither the authorities of i the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> nor’ the government of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> accepts any ‘ formula of recognition which would deny its. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable senator knows, Australia accords de jure recognition to the government of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in simple terms this Government is adopting the absurd position of saying that the government of those 800 million people on the mainland of <span class="highlight">China</span> as well as those on Taiwan is the Chiang Kai-shek Government in Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only a stupid incompetent government such as ours would say that the government on Taiwan represents the 800 million people on the mainland of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in the interests of Australia and in the interests of the proper maintenance of that rule of law which should apply internationally as well as in domestic affairs that the government which is the true government of <span class="highlight">China</span> should be recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If both the government on the island of Taiwan and the government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> maintain that there is only one <span class="highlight">China</span> and that everyone must accept and act ‘ on that proposition,  then the choice for us is clear - the lawful gov:ernment of <span class="highlight">China</span> must be the government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But while the government on Taiwan and the government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> say that .there is only one <span class="highlight">China</span> and only one government of <span class="highlight">China</span>, then that government must be the government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For myself I would say that the United States has recognised the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A great number of countries have refused to follow any longer the lead of those who want to exclude the 800 million people in <span class="highlight">China</span> from the councils of the world, who want to refuse to accord them any kind of recognition and who want to maintain the pretence that they do not exist except to say that they are repreented by the government on the island of Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The truth of the matter is that the Government has never really had a policy of its own towards <span class="highlight">China</span>; it has held on tightly to the apron strings of the United States and blindly followed the dictates of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, I for one have no confidence whatever in the contention that all we have to do is to try to make friends with them, to recognise them and to send people to Red <span class="highlight">China</span> on friendly missions and everything will be just as it should be between our country and Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs,  Mr Bury,  summed up the position in regard to Red <span class="highlight">China</span> very well when he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We accept that, perhaps more than any other government, that of <span class="highlight">China</span> has great domestic difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is necessary to point out that the isolation of <span class="highlight">China</span> from the international community has been largely the result of its own international attitudes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the conclusion of his remarks about <span class="highlight">China</span> he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government considers that the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is as much a fact of international life as is the People’s Republic of the mainland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is a condition of recognition of Red <span class="highlight">China</span> that we must recognise her right to do as she chooses with the 14 million people on Taiwan, surely that is enough to give pause to any idea that we should recognise her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard a good deal about trade and about the fact that <span class="highlight">China</span> no longer requires wheat from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that Red <span class="highlight">China</span> and South East Asia have been caught up in what has been termed the green revolution’ in South East Asia inasmuch as the people of those regions are probably growing more food and, incidentally, more rice, now than ever before in their history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some time ago one of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>’s spokesmen said: ‘We import wheat from Australia but we export rice to other counties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This arrangement is favourable to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because there is a surplus of rice in South East Asia and because the available export markets for <span class="highlight">China</span>’s rice have been restricted very considerably, there is not the need for <span class="highlight">China</span> to import Australian wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To send an emissary to Red <span class="highlight">China</span> would only wake up the Chinese to the fact that they could play politics with the trade of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a political Party - a Party which is not the government of this country but is, in fact, the Party in opposition - goes over the head of the Wheat Board and visits a country such as Red <span class="highlight">China</span>, then it must pinpoint clearly and beyond doubt the facility that is available to the Chinese to cause disruption within the borders of Australia and to play politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 repeat that recognition of Red <span class="highlight">China</span> and her- admission into the United Nations involves all sorts of complications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another, as was reported some time ago, is that <span class="highlight">China</span> wants the power of veto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the sake of extending this  emply  gesture of friendship - that is all it is - to Red <span class="highlight">China</span> we are supposed to throw away 14 million people in Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>urgency motion moved by  Senator Turnbull  is that it is in the best interests of Australia immediately to recognise the .People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>new arrangement for recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> was reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1st October is important to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> because it is the anniversary of the day on which it formed its Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In dealing with Asia today, and particularly the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, in looking back over thousands of years of history one can get into trouble because events are now moving very quickly there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember talking about 12 years ago, to a diplomat in Djakarta who forecast the separation of the great Communist giants, Russia and Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>.I did not believe him.I thought it was , wishful thinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A thaw is starting between the United States of America and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He said that he wanted  to  welcome the People’s Republic  of  <span class="highlight">China</span>  to  the family  of  nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been tremendous changes, one  of  which is the’ collapse  of  the alliance between Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A newspaper commented the other day that even though Russia had sent  an  ambassador  to  the People’s Republic  of  <span class="highlight">China</span>,  to  think that that would cement relations between them would  be  like asking the ReverendIan Paisley  to  take communion from thePope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have signed trade agreements with  Communist  <span class="highlight">China</span> not greatly different from those  of  previous years,as I understand  it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably the most important influence  on  the psychology  of  the People’s Republic  of  <span class="highlight">China</span> and Asia is the withdrawal  of  the American presence from South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To some  it  may have seemed  to be a  protecting umbrella, but  not to the  People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister was taken  to  task for using 7 different expressions  to  describe <span class="highlight">China</span> andI  am  frying  to  limit  my  terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is  easy to  refer  to  Taiwan and Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, but I understand that  the  People’s Republic  of  <span class="highlight">China</span> is the correct title. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously relations between Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span> have  a  bearing  on  the psychology  of  Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Turnbull  rightly pointed out, recognition does not mean that Australia approves of the type of government that has taken over in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this did not happen when the Communists took over mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> and I think there were good reasons for that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact if you examine <span class="highlight">China</span>’s history since 1927 and from the time Chiang Kai-shek took over, to the invasion by the Japanese and the subsequent fight against them with the allies you find that they have hardly been out of a war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will remember that <span class="highlight">China</span> was at the great conferences which were held at places like Potsdam, Yalta and Quebec during the war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Something which the western mind cannot grasp is called the ‘cultural revolution’ where young people were allowed to demonstrate on the streets but <span class="highlight">China</span> found it had created a Frankenstein monster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must come up against another fact and that is that <span class="highlight">China</span> is a member of the nuclear club. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe in the field of technology and nuclear science <span class="highlight">China</span> is a reasonably inefficient member of the nuclear club but there is no doubt and no gainsaying that it has nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would be the attitude if we were recognising Red <span class="highlight">China</span> or the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> today? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that <span class="highlight">China</span> is doing this,  ‘i  wc are worrying about this situation, what would be the situation if <span class="highlight">China</span> recognised a country like Australia which is indigenous to this area? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>able to apply pressure to <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, the 2- <span class="highlight">China</span> question will finally be settled in a Chinese way by the Chinese people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There ought to be 2 Koreas, 2 Irelands and 2 Chinas in the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should move quietly into this area and recognise Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> - or he People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> - as  Senator Turnbull  has suggested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that  Senator Turnbull’s  contribution to the debate in the context of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> was very much in the same sort of mystical and amazing way in which Marco Polo described the <span class="highlight">China</span> of his day in the thirteenth century, about 600 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those words mean that the Senate is being asked to bring pressure of whatever nature is possible on the Government of Australia today immediately to recognise Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Willesee  said it is not possible immediately to recognise Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> has to enter into some recognisance or undertakings before we exchange recognition by exchanging ambassadors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why the western world or, if you like, the United States, other countries and certainly our own country have refused to recognise Red <span class="highlight">China</span> - or the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> - for the last 20 years Ls simply that before we exchange embassies or recogni- lion with another country three things have to be in existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first point is that one country wishes to accept recognition from another country, l.have never seen any evidence of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> wishing to accept recognition from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> that would give, any assurance to any government  of  Australia, whatever its view, that it was possible to obtain and’ retain normal diplomatic relations, between 2 countries such as Australia and .the People’s Republic  of  <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are all sorts of reasons why <span class="highlight">China</span> may not wish to enter into ‘ what is described as the comity of nations, but certainly from the point of view  of  some countries - Australia is one of them- the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> through its ‘Government has not, by any of its attitudes in the last 20 years, displayed any of the characteristics that would lead any nation’ to” ‘trust ‘ft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our own kinsmen in the United Kingdom were among the first in the last 20 years and after the Korean War to recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, or Red <span class="highlight">China</span> as it is sometimes called. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United Kingdom sent a legation to Peking, but the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> did not even acknowledge its presence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government of India became so fearful of the chauvinism of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> that it entered into treaty arrangements with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With this turmoil of the Red Guard movement in <span class="highlight">China</span> it was obvious that over the last 3 years the Government in Peking was barely in control of its own country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must bear- in mind, because of ‘ what has been said by various senators in this place from time to time about the United States of America, that in the roundabout way in which international relations are sometimes conducted for at least 10 years the United States has been in almost constant consultation with the Warsaw Embassy of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not true to assert, for example, that  President  Nixon has recognised the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, any more than it can be said that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> has expressed any willingness to exchange some sort of understanding with the  President  of the United Stales of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Foreign Affairs  (Mr Bury)  on 6th April - all honourable senators have a copy of the statement - in which he said, as  Senator Willesee  mentioned, that one of the problems and objectives of the Government of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> at present appears to be the maintenance of the security of its borders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This can be acknowledged, although 1 sometimes wonder where the borders of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> really end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maps produced in the last 10 years show that Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> extends its suzerainty to the ancient boundaries of the Chinese khans in the time of Marco Polo 700 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only significant thing that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> has attempted to do is to establish a strong bargaining position with the 2 super powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the final analysis this amounts to good diplomatic practice by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be almost fatal in diplomatic exchanges for Australia at present to concede unilaterally because of strong international bargaining by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> positions which Australia would not wish to vacate under compulsion or persuasion at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge the existence of a thaw in diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I have lived: long enough to witness a so-called thaw in the attitude of the Union of Soviet: Socialist  Republics in 1953 and the subsequent freezing that took place after  Mr Brezhnev  became the First Secretary of the Communist Party and to wonder what the attitude of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> will be in another 5 or 6 years when  Chairman  Mao, the present great Khan of <span class="highlight">China</span>, goes to the heavenly kingdom, and  Mr Lin  Piao and another group of men who are mostly Army men who have themselves embedded in the matrix of power in the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> take his place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I welcome the diplomatic initatives that perhaps lead to a thawing of the .relations between the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Western world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Up to date we have heard an historical record of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During question lime today the Leader of the Government in the Senate,  Senator Sir Kenneth  Anderson, was asked a question about the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He declined to answer the question on the basis that an urgency proposal with respect to recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> was to be debated today and tha*  Senator Wright,  who would be the Minister in charge of that debate, would announce the Government’s- policy with respect lo the recognition of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that when an analysis of that speech is made the Government will have second thoughts as to whether that is its attitude towards the recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, because 1 think that that prepared statement contained pretty well every insult that could possibly be thought of to be thrown at the people of that great country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We constantly find reasons advanced why these 800 million people in <span class="highlight">China</span> are not to be trusted and should not be welcomed into the community of nations, although  Senator Wright  early in his remarks said that the Government has always recognised that at some time the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> would be drawn into the community of nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only is his statement a prevarication of previous attitudes held by the Government towards the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> but it is too vague for anyone to understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Twenty years have passed and we have made no moves to recognise mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> other than for the purposes of trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the Australian Country Party -  to back recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  was the first Australian Minister ever to say that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> should, sooner or later, be recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What sort of statement is it when a Minister of the Crown makes a vague statement that sooner or later the Government will recognise mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wright,  speaking on behalf of the Government, said that <span class="highlight">China</span> will be brought into the community of nations at some time, and now  Mr Anthony  says that sooner or later we will recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks more closely at the article - I do not know whom they seek to mislead - one will see that there was before the annual conference of the Victorian Country Party a proposal for the recognition of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was nothing to do with the recognition of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> and nothing to do with the Country Party recognising <span class="highlight">China</span>, as the heading states. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But tacked onto the end of the substantive part of the resolution are these words: and the recognition of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Sir Magnus Cormack said that not all the changes were taking place at this time, that there have been changes in the Australian Government’s attitude to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> over the 20 years that we have not recognised it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when the Minister in charge of the debate on this urgency proposal enunciated the Government’s policy he accused the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> of wanting to create revolution in practically every country in Asia right around to India. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what did  Senator Wright  say about <span class="highlight">China</span>’s attitude to the rest of Asia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: As far as the Australian Government is concerned, where is the change of attitude by <span class="highlight">China</span> which has, for example, enabled us now to follow the lead of the United States and send a ping-pong team to <span class="highlight">China</span> and engage in diplomatic relations of this sort? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia did not think of sending a ping-pong team to <span class="highlight">China</span> before the United States decided to send one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wright went on to say that Taiwan’s position must be protected in any recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that Taiwan must be protected, but we should be realistic and face up to the fact that the Government of the people of <span class="highlight">China</span> is the governmnt on the mainland and not the government on an island off the coast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to prevent, recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> the Australian Government has taken certain action in various world bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> from being admitted to membership of the IPU. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter what may be the feelings of certain reactionary people in this Parliament there is no doubt that within a very short period of time the Australian Government will recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>speech about .the attitude of small nations in Asia to the abandonment, of Taiwan it will be abandoned because, for the sake of trade, we will eventually and at a pretty early time recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Along with my colleagues on this side of the chamber,  1;  oppose the immediate unconditional recognition of the People’s Republic : of .<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to the interjection of  Senator Mulvihill  I would point out that Australia’s attitude depends on the attitude from time to time of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> shows that it can live peacefully alongside its neighbours and become a part of them I have no doubt that many of the Asian nations living alongside the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> will recognise it, although they do not do so at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack mentioned, I am nol aware of any great wish by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to recognise other countries, including Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, why should we rush in and more or less beg the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to accept us? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same situation applies in connection with the recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span> in the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most nations which wanted to join a body such as the United Nations or, for that matter, any organisation would accept the terms and conditions laid down by that organisation for entry, but the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> has itself . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>down what might be called impossible conditions, for entry into, the United Nations, lt wants the exclusion of Taiwan from the United Nations as well as a seat on the Security Council, which would ensure that nol only Taiwan but also any other country that was opposed to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> would not have a seat in the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There- is no doubt that most nations would have recognised <span class="highlight">China</span> long ago if she had’, been prepared to accept the conditions that every other nation had to accept in order to obtain entry into the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-One could be excused for wondering whether <span class="highlight">China</span> really wants to be a member of the United Nations because she has laid down such impossible conditions about her entry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This morning  Senator Cant  asked a question about the Country ‘ Party’s policy, and particularly about  Mr Anthony’s  policy, towards <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Anthony  has been accused of insulting <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At other times he has been accused of wanting to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement is: ‘We hope that in time we will reach a stage at which we can recognise <span class="highlight">China</span> - there will be mutual agreement end mutual acceptance - but at the same time we are not prepared to sink our principles of foreign policy just for trade’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would not do that for the very good reason that politics have never entered <span class="highlight">China</span>’s trade policy, despite what some members of the Opposition might say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The history of our trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>, particularly in relation to wheat, is a very interesting one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last 10 years Australia has sold to <span class="highlight">China</span> 20.21 million metric tons of wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia and Canada are the main suppliers of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This 20.21 million metric tons represents 40.36 per cent of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s imports of wheat during that period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Canadian exports were 17.24 million metric tons, which represents 37.2 per cent of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s imports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Argentinian wheat represents only 9 per cent of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s imports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>France sells to <span class="highlight">China</span> 7.1 per cent of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s imports of wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A look at the total wheat exports of these nations shows that in most years 30 per cent of France’s total wheat exports have gone to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That represents about 7 per cent of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s imports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figure for Canada has varied, but about 17 per cent of her exports have gone to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That emphasises what I said earlier: <span class="highlight">China</span> will buy her wheat where she can get the best deal and where she can get the type of wheat she wants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main reason why <span class="highlight">China</span> is not buying wheat is that she has had a bumper crop of rice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, <span class="highlight">China</span> has relied on income derived from export ing rice to pay for the wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until we get the full figures, which will not be released for another few months, we do not know what any other country is selling to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only thing that we know is that there has been a very small quantity of wheat, much less than in previous years, sold to <span class="highlight">China</span> by Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that Australia was following the United States of America, by sending a ping-pong team to <span class="highlight">China</span> and that because a United States ping-pong team went there we had to follow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No teams were invited to <span class="highlight">China</span> until just recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once <span class="highlight">China</span> agreed to relax her restrictions on teams visiting there, <span class="highlight">China</span> invited a sporting team to visit there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> is a world leader in pingpong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> invited the Americans to play there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that,  if  the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>f believe that the Government is adopting a sound approach, by gradually reviewing the position in regard to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We do not want to be begging for <span class="highlight">China</span>’s recognition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is urgent about the recognition of Red <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would think that the recognition of Red <span class="highlight">China</span> would depend a great deal on the admission of that country to the United Nations - an international community of nations and an organisation of which Red <span class="highlight">China</span> has not been able to get membership up till now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Peking should renounce the use of force and acknowledge the right of other nations to live in peace, free of the threat of wars of national liberation sponsored by <span class="highlight">China</span>, before it is admitted to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They deplored the fact that  Senator Wright  stated indisputable facts about the aggressive nature of Red <span class="highlight">China</span> against peaceful countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 am talking about Red <span class="highlight">China</span> at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Red <span class="highlight">China</span> demands, as a condition of diplomatic relations, acceptance of her claims of sovereignty over Taiwan and its 14 or 15 million people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>’s endorsement of an inevitable world war for the triumph of Communism renders her unworthy of recognition or entry to the family of nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, we repeat and reaffirm our opposition to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>’s policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We stand opposed to the recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tn our opinion there is no movement by Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> away from these attitudes, which would justify recognition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> has the means at her disposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following my visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> some 7 or 8 years ago I have advocated visits to that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have advocated visits to <span class="highlight">China</span> because it is necessary for us to get to know the people of <span class="highlight">China</span> probably more than any other country and for them to get to know us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The propaganda which is put out by the Communist Government of Red <span class="highlight">China</span> is designed to foster hatred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not matter where you go in <span class="highlight">China</span> - I went by train into the more outlying- areas - there is intense hatred of the people of the West because the Chinese do not know us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I smiled upon the people as I smile upon the honourable senator in the hope of getting a friendly smile in return, but I did not get any friendly response from the Chinese people in mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude of the people of Red <span class="highlight">China</span> indicates that the propaganda being put out by the Communist Government is very successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I got a visa and I travelled through <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While in <span class="highlight">China</span> I sought an interview with the Minister for Trade because I wanted to find out for myself the attitude of the Chinese people towards future trade with Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 was told by the Minister for Trade that <span class="highlight">China</span> would continue to buy wheat and other articles from us if our prices were right and if we sought to buy more goods from her. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many more articles are coming into Australia now from mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> than was the case previously, and I hope that that fact eventually will convince the Chinese people that we are keen to have friendly relations with them and to continue trading together on a friendly, reasonable and properly thought-out basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not sure that the wheat we have sold to <span class="highlight">China</span> in the past has been a very economical exercise for us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I went through <span class="highlight">China</span> by train especially so that I could look at agricultural conditions in the country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One must congratulate the people of <span class="highlight">China</span> on their efforts to make their country produce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have done a very good job and for that reason I am not attacking the Government of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was amazed to hear  Senator Murphy  claim that  President  Nixon had said that America was recognising the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  President  said that being friendly with <span class="highlight">China</span> and encouraging people to go there did not involve recognition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like  Senator Gair,  I think that it should come after the entry pf mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> into the United Nations when it has demonstrated that it intends to recognise the principles of the United Nations in maintaining peace and in settling disputes in peaceful ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Murphy  said that we on the Government side claim that Chiang Kai-shek’s Government’ is the Government df mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>! <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we do claim that Chiang Kaishek’s Government was the last freely elected government in mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we do recognise Red <span class="highlight">China</span> I hope that we will never claim that Taiwan is not a country which we should recognise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no elections in mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We intend to recognise both countries but we will not be bludgeoned into recognising Red <span class="highlight">China</span> and massacring, if that is the word, the people of Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an amazing statement because’ Hong Kong is of great value to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> for the entrance of overseas currency and as an outlet for its goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation of Hong Kong certainly suits <span class="highlight">China</span> very well indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Turnbull wants a parliamentary delegation to visit <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would’ ‘not’ be possible to have an exchange of parliamentarians because Red <span class="highlight">China</span> does hot have any parliamentarians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hot like to see our representatives attempting to enter Red <span class="highlight">China</span> at the time of the May Day or October celebrations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  Have  seen enough of the propaganda exercises carried on in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At those times the people of <span class="highlight">China</span> rally in their millions to demonstrate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that that era is passing, but we should not visit Red <span class="highlight">China</span> at such times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not agree with  Senator Cant  that we have sent  a  ping-pong team to Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It says that H is in the best interests of Australia immediately to recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and I believe that the debate should be conducted on that basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Turnbull  does not say that it is in .the best interests of <span class="highlight">China</span> that we should recognise <span class="highlight">China</span> but that it is in the best interests of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe it is incontrovertible that it is in the best interests of Australia to accord recognition to the effective Government of <span class="highlight">China</span>, which is in Peking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The laws of <span class="highlight">China</span> are made by that Government and all authority within <span class="highlight">China</span> is exercised by it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>claimed by the Australian Government that the Government in Formosa- led by the octogenarian immigrant from mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> - is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the Government of the whole of <span class="highlight">China</span>, but it is in effect the present policy of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By continuing to insist that the seat occupied by <span class="highlight">China</span> in the United Nations be occupied by representatives of the Taiwan regime, and that the permanent seat on the Security Council of the United Nations be occupied by representatives of the Taiwan regime, the Australian Government is recognising the claim made by Chiang Kai-shek and his elderly supporters in Taipei that he is the government of the whole of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not an indication of an opinion one might hold about <span class="highlight">China</span> that one recognises the Peking Government as the effective government of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Among the nations which recognise the Peking Government are a great many countries whose policies bear little resemblance to the policies of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, in many instances they are very antagonistic to the policies of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Among the Commonwealth countries which recognise the Peking Government, the government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, are Canada, Ceylon, ‘ Ghana, India, Kenya, Mauritius, Nigeria, Pakistan,- Tanzania, the United Kingdom and Zambia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most of them have, very little political or ideological affinity with the Government of <span class="highlight">China</span> but they accord it recognition. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I find it extraordinary that the Government which at present conscripts young Australians to fight in Vietnam in a war that is no business whatsoever of the Australian people and which engages in the butchery in Vietnam, has the audacity to say that <span class="highlight">China</span> does not live up to our high standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that the history of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the present Chinese Government shows that it has lived up to what it has said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only countries into which <span class="highlight">China</span> has sent its forces are India, and North Korea when it was invited to do so by the Governments of those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> issued a clear warning to the United States that if American forces crossed the Yalu River and thus threatened <span class="highlight">China</span> it would send its forces to North Korea, and it did so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For many years the western powers had recognised <span class="highlight">China</span>’s claim that Tibet is a province of <span class="highlight">China</span>, Whatever the present government in Peking has done in Tibet is no different to what preceding Chinese governments have done and what the government of Chiang Kai-shek himself would do if he were in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other occasion when Chinese forces have been outside <span class="highlight">China</span> was when they were in India as a result of the complex dispute about the McMahon Line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the past year there has been considerable research by scholars into what took place in the armed dispute between <span class="highlight">China</span> and India several years ago concerning the north eastern frontier of India. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever may be said about that situation, whoever was right or wrong on the issue, if <span class="highlight">China</span> is an aggressive nation - which it is alleged to be - one can only wonder why it was content with merely occupying the limited areas which it claimed during the dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The policy of the present Australian Government on the recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span> is not based on any realities of the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government knows that when it wants to sell wheat, wool or rolled steel to <span class="highlight">China</span> it is not going to see anybody in Taipei. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When Government supporters are at the South Kew Liberal Party Women’s Branch they will refer to <span class="highlight">China</span> as Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> or possibly Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are in an absurd situation where we find that at the present time countries in Asia which it has been claimed have suffered so terribly from the menace of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Pakistan, Ceylon and Indonesia have recognised and have diplomatic relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> as have Afghanistan and Nepal, whose esteemed ruler will be visiting us tomorrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>King of Nepal as being in any way a Red yet he recognises the government in Peking as being the government of <span class="highlight">China</span> and his country is proud to send ambassadors to represent him in Peking and receive ambassadors from Peking in his capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are precluded from taking part in discussions concerning our interests in South East Asia which could lead to peace in this area in which we are vitally concerned because we refuse to talk and negotiate with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not <span class="highlight">China</span> which is suffering because of this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For that reason I commend to the Senate the resolution moved by  Senator Turnbull  that it is in the best interests of Australia that we should immediately recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs inform the Senate whether the Government of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> has yet accorded full diplomatic recognition with mutual exchange of envoys at ambassador level to the Government of Great Britain? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710427_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the honourable senator that matters associated with diplomatic recognition of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> were debated fully last week in this chamber and in another place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710427_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I reserve to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the opportunity to be precise about diplomatic recognition of Great Britain by <span class="highlight">China</span> and the implementation of that recognition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710427_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the Leader of the Government in the Senate noted that a United States presidential commission yesterday recommended that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> be admitted to the United Nations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the Australian Government then responsible for leaking that information so that Green Beret methods would be used to eliminate Francis James, or alternatively, was the information supplied to agents of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation or the United States Central Intelligence Agency in the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in order to ensure that Francis James would be detained indefinitely in that country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Can honourable senators imagine what would happen if a number of students in the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany or Red <span class="highlight">China</span> entered the office of an administrator or a leader in the Government and performed as these people did? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were some funny aspects of our visit We had secret meetings and we were all told to rush about and contact as many people as we could to persuade them to vote against <span class="highlight">China</span>’s admission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said: ‘But,  Mr Ambassador,  you do not expect me to do that, do you, because I have been around to try to get them to vote for <span class="highlight">China</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government is now worrying about relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our young people hear from the DLP in election campaigns that we are likely to be invaded by <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When an election is over no more is said about imminent invasion by <span class="highlight">China</span> and the daily, or almost hourly, onslaught by television of the terrible things that could happen ceases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether he has read an article in today’s Melbourne ‘Age’ referring to  Dr Jackson,  the  President  of the Australian Table Tennis Association, who says that he has been profoundly moved by his expert?ences in <span class="highlight">China</span>, where he has found that the people have been friendly and warm, and everyone is well fed, and that be is convinced that <span class="highlight">China</span> does not intend any aggression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710430_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So impressed is  Dr Jackson  with what he has seen that he intends to take 2 months off from his practice in Adelaide to write and lecture in Australia about <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710430_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government intend to do anything at all to relieve the tension between our country and <span class="highlight">China</span> which has had a disastrous effect on our rural industries, particularly on our wheat exports? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710430_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now we do not mind playing ping pong with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is a good thing that Australians have been meeting with Chinese and I would have no objection to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> sending a team to play ping pong against Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Canada, which has a much more liberal policy, may take them, but in other cases they go over the border to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> which gets the advantage of their services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs inform the Senate whether the Government of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> has yet accorded full diplomatic recognition with mutual exchange of envoys at ambassador level to the Government of Great Britain? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If <span class="highlight">China</span> has so recognised Great Britain, will the Minister advise the date of such recognition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Governments of the United Kingdom and of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> have recognised each other since 1950, and offices headed by Charges d’Affaires are maintained in the respective capitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has he, as a member of Cabinet, read, or does he know of, the proposed statement to be made by the Minister for Trade and Industry, who is the  Deputy  Prime Minister, on exports now to be permitted to be sent to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> or, as my friends in the corner delight in telling us, Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he agree with me that such exports are the main component parts for arms and munitions which <span class="highlight">China</span> has been and will now no doubt continue to send to the North Vietnamese forces to wound or kill Australians who are forced to fight in Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do the Government and its supporters in the corner reconcile their conscience to their oft repeated statements that Australia should not be a party to exporting to <span class="highlight">China</span> materials to be used in the manufacture of arms and ammunitions which are used, I repeat, to kill Australians in the undeclared war in Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister still expect the Government to get the blind support of the Australian Democratic Labor Party irrespective of the decision to supply such exports to <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will he tell me what hold the Government has on those who strongly oppose, by their voices, such exports to <span class="highlight">China</span>, but yet blindly, by their votes, support the action of the Government in sending to <span class="highlight">China</span> iron, steel and chemicals for the manufacture of arms and munitions with which to kill or maim Australian soldiers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Turning to the subject matter of the question, there is a list of strategic materials which nations do not supply to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not know whether the honourable member mentioned by the honourable senator would be going to <span class="highlight">China</span>, and if he were going to <span class="highlight">China</span> I would not know in what capacity he would go unless it was as a private citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been several reports from varied sources which have referred to the large grain crop in Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> and, as  a  consequence, the likely reduced demand for wheat from that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would comment only that if <span class="highlight">China</span> needs to import wheat there are factors in Australia’s favour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition the quality of Australian wheat shipped to <span class="highlight">China</span> has been very acceptable to the buyers, while the terms and conditions of sale have also met their requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister been advised of a resolution carried at the weekend conference of the South Australian Young Liberal movement supporting Australia’s diplomatic recognition of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> and support for Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>’s application for admission to the United Nations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, has the Minister studied the statement made by  Mr W.  R.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of that statement by such an enlightened diplomat, supported by a resolution of the politically biased Young Liberals of South Australia, will the Government reconsider its attitude to recognition of and diplomatic relationship with Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the Government’s attitude, Parliament was assured in the first statement on foreign affairs made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs,  Mr Bury,  that the Government had noted the trend in matters affecting, firstly, the admission of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations and, secondly, recognition of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the things that was discussed in this chamber in recent weeks and which is raised here in discussing this Bill is the relationship of Australia with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, particularly the promotion of our primary exports to that country and the breakdown in relations and the export of primary products to that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-61-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was indicated by  Mr Bury,  the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in his first statement on foreign affairs early in April, that international opinion with regard to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> was changing and that this Government had been keeping under review and constantly studying in view of diplomatic exchanges from time to time, the effect of that change of opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the well known and unfortunate instances of visitors to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, even those whose views were known to be favourable to the country, being held incommunicado for long periods without any justifiable reason being made known, can any action be taken by the Federal Government, through any diplomatic channels, to ensure the safe return to Australia of the Leader of the Australian Labour Party,  Mr Whitlam,  and his party at the end of their proposed visit to <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the statement made by  Mr C.  J. Perrett, the former General Manager of the Australian Wheat Board, at a Legacy luncheon that the Federal Government’s failure to recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> was a barrier to wheat trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> and that Australia will have an uphill job regaining this trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the Prime Minister’s statement yesterday on the likelihood of  the recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span> by the United Nations and Australia, will the Government commence as early as possible setting diplomatic and economic machinery in motion to recover our previous share of the Chinese wheat market? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those sales, on the last assessment that I read in the Press, roughly equal the sales which had been made previously to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since I am informed, on credible authority, that large quantities of the wheat sold to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> were sold at less than the cost of production, it does not appear to me that the loss of sales to that country is the major trade problem which very many of our commentators seem to think that it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Abstaining from all references that might disrupt proceedings,  Senator Hannan  asks me a question that relates to an invitation by a Chinese authority to a Labor delegation to discuss relations between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span>, and also refers to  Mr Whitlam,  the Leader of the Opposition in another place, making some statement about by-passing the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Minister for Foreign Affairs that Taiwan’s place in the United Nations in the name of <span class="highlight">China</span> for the past 25 years has been somewhat fictional mean that the Australian Government will now officially support <span class="highlight">China</span>’s admission to the United Nations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister request the Minister for Foreign Affairs to facilitate arrangements for  Mr Whitlam,  the Leader of the Australian Labor Party delegation to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, to meet his counterpart when he is in that country with a view to ascertaining whether his counterpart enjoys the same measure of freedom, liberty, privileges and concessions as  Mr Whitlam  enjoys as Leader of the Opposition in this Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, but I do not know how that action would interfere with  Mr Whitlam’s  trip to <span class="highlight">China</span> and with those members of the Labor Party who happen to be abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I have suggested will not affect  Mr Whitlam’s  proposed visit to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>or alternatively, was the information supplied to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation or Central Intelligence Agency agents in the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in order to ensure that Francis James would be detained indefinitely in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710520_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is known that  Mr Francis  James entered the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> from Hong Kong in October 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710520_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is known that  Mr Jamesthen  visited <span class="highlight">China</span> and that he travelled from Canton to the Hong Kong border by train on 4th November 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710520_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He informed an Australian passenger during that journey that he believed he might have difficulties leaving the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710520_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The British Government has, at the request of the Australian Government, made 5 formal written requests, and 1 oral request, to the Foreign Ministry in Peking, asking about  Mr James’s  whereabouts, but has received no acknowledgement, or confirmation or denial of his presence in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710520_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has received no report to suggest that  Mr James  is at liberty, in <span class="highlight">China</span> or elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710520_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Industry whether he can provide details of trade during the past 12 months between Australia and the Peoples Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assume that the honourable senator is seeking a breakdown of exports to the Peoples Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, specified by items, during the 12 months ended June 1971, and also details of Australia’s imports from that country during the same period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Industry and has particular reference to those honourable senators who claim that Taiwan-Australia interests should be submerged for those of Red <span class="highlight">China</span> and Australia in the recognition of Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the United States Ambassador in Taiwan has publicly predicted that Taiwan’s international trade volume may be equal ‘ to or in excess of that of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> in 2 or 3 years’ time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that, taking 1968 as a base year, Taiwan increased its international trade 33 per cent last year and by 23.9 per cent in 1969 while Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> increased its trade by 6.3 per cent in 1969 and S.8 per cent last year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister give similar figures for the volumes and growth rates of trade between Taiwan and Australia and Red <span class="highlight">China</span> and Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that die United States Ambassador to the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> said, when addressing the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei, that the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s total trade volume may be equal to, or larger than, that of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> within 2 or 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s international trade increased by 34 per cent (exports by 33 per cent, imports by 35 per cent) from 1968 to 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trade statistics are not published by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and can be obtained only on a derived basis from statistics reported by other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some countries do not report trade statistics with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and therefore total People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> trade can only be an estimate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, allowing for these assumptions, it would appear that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s total trade increased by approximately 7 .per cent in 1969 compared with 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s trade with the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> increased by 29 per cent in 1969 (exports by 26 per cent, imports by 37 per cent) and by 27 per cent in 1970 (exports by 24 per cent, imports by 33 per cent). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s trade with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> increased by 29 per cent in 1969 ‘(exports by 34 per cent, imports by 14 per cent) and by 7 per cent in 1970 (exports by 8 per cent, imports by 3 per cent). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As requested by  Senator Cant  in a later question on 17th May, I asked the Minister for a list of goods on which trade is restricted with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The products remaining under export control for the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> will now be the same as those under export control for the European Communist countries, excluding Yugoslavia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, I have obtained the following trade statistics of Australia’s trade with the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> for the interest of senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One can imagine them boasting about some demonstration by one of their unions against the recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>; for the continuation of the Vietnam war; or in favour of the Springbok tour or if we believe the sentiments of  Senator Gair,  in favour of apartheid itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beyond the immediate threats within and against Vietnam there was a militant <span class="highlight">China</span> - a <span class="highlight">China</span> which was giving direct moral and material aid to North Vietnam and which had in the recent past occupied Tibet and fought with India, a <span class="highlight">China</span> whose ambitions and policies in the area were causing great concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today the picture is different - in East Asia, in South East Asia, and not least in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Government’s earnest hope that the war can be brought to an early end by serious negotiations, that peace and stability will soon prevail throughout the area, and that the countries of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> - not excluding North Vietnam - will be able to devote their energies with the help of others to worthwhile productive efforts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Prime Minister’s statement on the future of the Australian forces in Vietnam are repeated the same old untruths which we have been hearing for the past 6 years - the same weak, implausible explanations for the presence of young Australian conscripts in the unhappy countries of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the  President  of the United States decided to go to <span class="highlight">China</span> to pay court to  Chairman  Mao in order to salvage the few vestiges of American interests still left in that part of the world following the results of the United States’ absurd foreign policy, did the  President  give any consideration to the embarrassing situation in which he placed his loyal ally, the Prime Minister of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did he pay any heed to the situation which existed in Australia at that time after the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  had been to <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If  Senator Hannan  is suggesting that the Leader of the Opposition sold out Australia by going to <span class="highlight">China</span> I suggest that he carefully read the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and ask for assistance on any parts he cannot understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here was the Prime Minister of Australia  (Mr McMahon)  accusing the Leader of the Opposition, with words he has now dropped but which  Senator Hannan  still remembers, of selling out Australia by going to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>President Nixon, the  President  of the United States himself, is to go off to <span class="highlight">China</span>, his arrangements made for him by none other than  Dr Kissinger,  regarded as probably the most eminent - or, if ‘eminent’ is not the word, the most persuasive and well-informed - adviser to the United States Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the Australian Labor Party’s great concern to ensure that parliamentary elections are held in the countries of South East Asia, especially South Vietnam, I ask the Minister: What was the date on which the election was held which resulted in the appointment of Chou En-lai as Prime Minister of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>You,  Mr President,  the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Leader of the Opposition will have been acquainted with the fact that the Australian Democratic Labor Party has given notice of its intention to move an urgency motion on 8th September in respect of Australia’s relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I may continue, the criticism made against Labor’s trip to <span class="highlight">China</span> was shocking, lt was suggested that we were creating all sorts of problems by sending a delegation to <span class="highlight">China</span>, but this is the greatest thing that has ever happened for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the Liberal Party Conference in Tasmania the Prime Minister had a speech prepared and was ready to go in and castigate the Labor Party for its initiative in establishing contacts in the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, but he found as he was about to enter the place that  Mr Nixon  had already arranged to go to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the 17th August  Senator Sim  askedthe Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Industry whether he could provide details of trade during the past 12 months between Australia and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, including if possible, in those details the recent purchase of merino rams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In mid-June, 1971 the Soviet Union advised the other four nuclear weapon states - the United States, Britain, France and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> - that it ‘proposed to convene at the earliest time a conference of the Five Powers possessing nuclear weapons.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 30th July, the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> issued a statement that it would at no time agree to participate in nuclear disarmament talks which did not include all countries of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It called on the United States and the Soviet Union to issue undertakings, as <span class="highlight">China</span> had repeatedly done, not to be the first to use nuclear weapons, and also to withdraw all nuclear arms resources to their own territories as a preliminary gesture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should not wait until some other country has won the markets, as happened when Canada got a big slice of wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span>.- 1 believe that this Government should follow the example set  by the Australian Labor Party when lt sent a delegation to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that the Australian Wheat Board has made sales of wheat to Egypt and other Middle East countries amounting to some 2 million tons, which has more than compensated for the reduction in sales of wheat to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> this year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A decision by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to use a frequency other than that prescribed by a World Administrative Radio Conference would have no effect on the decision itself since such decisions can only be changed by another World Administrative Radio Conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a practical situation it could be that if the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> did not use the recommended frequency band, interference could result to the radio communication services of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conversely, similar interference could also result to radio communication services of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It should be noted that when the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> launched its first satellite on the 24th April, 1970, the frequency, used was within the band allocated to the standard frequency service in which space research services are permitted to operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First he pointed out that Australia at present lives in circumstances that are comparatively new to it in the matter of defence with the disappearance of the British presence from this area, with the impending withdrawal of United States forces from South East Asia and, of course, with the shock of  President  Nixon’s reversal of previous American attitudes towards <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1  do not want to hurt anybody’s feelings, but I must say that I have been Leader of the Government in the Senate for a long time now and I never have questions directed to me to elicit criticism of elections held in Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> or Russia, behind the Iron Curtain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: Does the Government expect the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to be admitted to the United Nations Organisation and to be seated in the Security Council? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government consider the possibility of arranging a parliamentary delegation to <span class="highlight">China</span> in order to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is important because at this moment similar treatment is being urged for Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After the liberation of lndo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, Burma will fall into line as a good foundation has already been laid there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Chinese were being most aggressive and we need only recall <span class="highlight">China</span>’s activities in India and Tibet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When national defence is concerned the Opposition’s policy is this: Hands off the Communists whether they be from Russia, <span class="highlight">China</span> or anywhere else because they do not represent a threat to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I say that the present Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  was waltzing around this country when he was busily castigating the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  as having been played in <span class="highlight">China</span> like a trout, I think was the word that he used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that if members of the Country Party have got up to their ears in their involvement in the Vietnam war because they wanted to sell their beef and wheat - it should be remembered that they were selling their wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> until they lost the market - they ought to develop a proper attitude to defence and not give Australian blood for trade with any country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an area dominated by the enormous armed might, conventional and nuclear, of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the United States withdraws militarily from Asia and Britain pulls out its forces, this area will lack a balance of power to offset <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will just let our country go to hell; let it be here for the taking, whether by <span class="highlight">China</span>, Indonesia, Japan or Russia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The second matter negotiated was not really an agreement as much as a final declaration - an unsigned declaration - of the Geneva Conference, the parties to which were representatives of Cambodia, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, France, Laos, the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, the State of Vietnam - I point out to honourable senators that South Vietnam was not recognised in the declaration - the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It had arrows pointing dowm from <span class="highlight">China</span> and said that C;ina was the big boy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ask the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether it is a fact that the Leader of the Opposition in another place, when recently visiting mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, returned information to Australia that the Government of that country would welcome and would be encouraged to learn of a change of government in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Perhaps this would cover an invasion of <span class="highlight">China</span> by Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From  Senator Little’s  interjections I take it that he would be in favour of our intervening in a war between Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They said that there was a threat of world wide Communist expansion and that both the Soviet Union and Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> - Red <span class="highlight">China</span> as they called it when they were not talking about wheat sales - were determined to conquer this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly they had taken over in Russia and then, by some strange process, they had taken over in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we were faced with this menace, but we were allied with the United States of America steadfastly opposed to Communism - a country which would never talk to Chou En-lai or Mao Tsetung; a country which would never recognise Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>; a country which, with every fibre of its being, would oppose the admission of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is that the conflict has now extended from Vietnam into Cambodia and has been intensified in Laos, and a war that once could have been described as the Vietnam war is now referred to by most people as the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> war because it would be quite inaccurate to talk about it as the Vietnam war; it is the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are not free elections in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What it said was: ‘We are different from the Communists in <span class="highlight">China</span>, North Vietnam and those places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not sent troops to North Vietnam and we have not sent troops to <span class="highlight">China</span> in order to carry out some wild claim that we would preserve democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the  President  of the United States announced his intention of going to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, did he inform his loyal little ally, the Prime Minister of Australia, that he intended to do so? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did he even give sufficient warning to the Prime Minister of Australia that he intended to go to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in order to stop the Prime Minister from making a fool of himself when he attacked the visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> of the Leader of the Opposition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have come to the conclusion now that they cannot knock over the North Vietnamese and whether people like it or not, <span class="highlight">China</span> is where it is and that is where it is going to stay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Slowly but surely and reluctantly they are getting out and at the same time, with some hesitation and with a farewell wave to their old friends in Taipei they are putting forward propositions that Red <span class="highlight">China</span>, now always respectfully referred to as the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, become a member not only of the United Nations General Assembly but also of the Security Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 speak of American policy because probably the major part of the propaganda for Australia’s involvement in Vietnam - in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> - was because of our American alliance, whatever that is or may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether we like the form of government they are adopting or whether we do not like the form of government they are adopting, the people of Indonesia, Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, Malaysia, India, Pakistan - both east and west - are going to choose their own form of government in the same way as the people of <span class="highlight">China</span> have chosen their form of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the Australian Government for many years has contended that there is only one lawful government of all <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711026_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that this day the United Nations has overwhelmingly recognised the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> as the one lawful government of all <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711026_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government now cease its foolish course of claiming that the Chiang Kai-shek regime in Taiwan is the one lawful government of all <span class="highlight">China</span>, including mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, and will it give immediate recognition to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> as the lawful government of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711026_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, I ask the Minister: As <span class="highlight">China</span> is now to become a member of the community of nations, will the Government as a member of that community ensure that Australiansited bases are not used to spy on another friendly member country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711026_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I will say that BHP has to our knowledge been engaged in trading transactions with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711026_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to that aspect of the honourable senator’s question relating to the Government’s initiative, it is well known that this Government has been taking purposeful initiatives over many months now with the object of establishing diplomatic relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711026_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711026_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Customs and Excise been drawn to the fact that samples of fabric have been imported into Australia from Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> which purport to be, and are labelled so as to lead a purchaser to believe that they are woollen piece goods when in truth the material contains no wool whatsoever and is manufactured from 100 per cent man made fibre? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711102_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, would it not be justice to apply this principle to the membership of Taiwan and Red <span class="highlight">China</span> instead of the unworthy, despicable decision to expel a country which has done nothing to deserve such a fate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711102_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The implications for Australian defence and security of Britain’s decision to enter the European Economic Community and the decision of the United Nations to seat the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in the General Assembly of the United Nations and on the Security Council in place of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and to expel the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> from the world body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 2 decisions to which I refer are, firstly, the decision of the British Parliament, through the House of Lords and the House of Commons, by an overwhelming majority to enter the European Economic Community and, secondly, the decision of the United Nations General Assembly to admit the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> as a member nation of the United Nations, to seat it on the Security Council and to expel the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> - that is, Taiwanese <span class="highlight">China</span> - from the world body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second important event was the decision of the General Assembly of the United Nations to seat the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in the General Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Singapore knows that if the Communists should break through from the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> peninsula into Malaysia they will break through into Singapore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same position could well develop in South East Asia if <span class="highlight">China</span>, for example, having a minority ethnic group available to it in some of the countries to our north, as a protecting power tried to subvert any one of these countries by the stimulation of the minority movements in any of them and that country became an accommodating power to <span class="highlight">China</span>, or to any other nation not friendly to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the relevance of this is that there may be some stimulation of this type of activity not merely with the takeover by a power hostile to Australia but also with the admission of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations which gives that nation an aura of international respectability to which smaller nations may, and probably will, respond. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will give to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> an accommodation which might provide all these opportunities which otherwise could be provided only by armed control or by national hegemony over the smaller power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one of the dangers that I see implicit in the international recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> as we saw it in the United Nations the other day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister stated that Australia had moved away from the theories of containment of <span class="highlight">China</span> and active hostility towards Communism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been suggested that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> can pose no military threat in this area because, although that nation now possesses nuclear capacity, it has no strike force which could provide a delivery stystem <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was said of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> that she had no strike capacity, but in the last fortnight it has been publicly announced that <span class="highlight">China</span> has a strike capacity of up to 1,000 miles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> therefore now has the capacity to deliver nuclear warheads to countries within a range of 1,000 miles of her launching bases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another threat developing in this area is connected with the admission of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations and with Britain’s entry into the European Economic Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> is not withdrawing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the entry of Great Britain into the European Economic Community and to the decision of the United Nations to admit the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and to allow it a seat in the Security Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With that background I want to come to the context of the matter of urgency motion, which says that the entry of Britain into the European Economic Community and the vote taken in the United Nations on Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>’s admission to that body are linked to the defence of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first concerns Britain’s decision to enter the European Economic Community and the second concerns the implications of the decision of the United Nations to seat the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in the General Assembly and the Security Council of the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to that second element, namely, the decision of the United Nations to seat the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Albanian resolution brought the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> into the United Nations with a seat on the Security Council and led to the simultaneous expulsion of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> which- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inherent in that resolution was not only the entry of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> but also the expulsion of Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The true position is that the Albanian resolution provided for the expulsion of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> on Taiwan, but Taiwan’s representatives walked out before that resolution was passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to let it be known that the Austraiian Government voted with 34 other nations against the expulsion of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that Australia made its position clear: It supported the entry of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> - that is, Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> - to the General Assembly and the Security Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point that I wish to bring out is that this dual representation draft resolution affirmed the right of representation of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, recommended that the PRC be seated as one of the 5 permanent members of the Security Council and affirmed the continuing right of representation of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> - Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 21st October 1971, in addressing the United Nations General Assembly, the Australian representative,  Sir Laurence  Mclntyre, noted that the great majority of representatives supported the representation of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following what 1 am bound to admit has been an abridged summary of the events in the United Nations, we can reflect upon the second part of the matter of public importance proposed by  Senator Byrne  and say that we hope that when it takes its seat in the General Assembly and in the Security Council, Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> will adopt constructive and moderate policies and positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The entry of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> into the United Nations will remove it from its isolated position and will bring it into much closer contact with the community of nations, particularly those which arc members of the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But from what I saw of the statement, it indeed reflected the views that the Prime Minister and the Government have expressed, not as late as yesterday but over the whole period of the last 6 to 8 months during which this question of the proposed entry of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> into the United Nations has arisen and has been under constant examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that, in the Security Council, the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> will have the power of veto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>’s seat on the Security Council is not something which gives it great power in isolation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The General Assembly, in which the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> will have a place also, has the power of recommendation only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The entry of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations will not in any way affect the ANZUS Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make a point about what I believe is a judgment implicit in the subject of this urgency discussion; that is that the entry of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations is going to prejudice our defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Australians we are sad and sorry that we failed to retain the place of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, Taiwan, in the United Nations while at the same time we supported the admittance of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s view always was that there should be a place in the United Nations for the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government welcomed  President  Nixon’s announcement that he would visit the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been our stated hope that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> will come to play a more constructive role in this region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> will come into the group of nations as distinct from being isolated from them as it has been in the past; that it will play a more constructive role in the region than it has in the past; and that its admission to the United Nations will advance prospects for a peaceful settlement of the problems of the Asian and Pacific region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am prepared to accept in respect of the second part of the topic of discussion that the entry of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations will bring home to the Chinese all the responsibilities of membership of that body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said that the Government now desires, and always has desired, peaceful and friendly relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>; that it welcomes <span class="highlight">China</span>’s admission to the United Nations, where it will learn of th? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>high responsibilities which we and other countries apparently have learnt there; and that it is quite delighted that the People’s Republic has been admitted to the United Nations although it is a pity that the Government’s old friends in Taiwan, the so-called Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, are no longer members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This statement in itself would be quite acceptable were it not a complete reversal of everything that the Government has been saying for the past 20 years, a reversal of the points it has made consistently in support of its election programmes for the past 20 years, lt seems to me only the other day - it cannot be very much longer - that we were being shown maps with red arrows leading from <span class="highlight">China</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told that th: first duty of all Australians was to resist this menace from the north and that the ultimate proof of the treasonable intent of members of the Australian Labor Party was that they argued that there should b: recognition of the Government of Pekina, and admission of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations, lt was not more than a few months ago that we were told about the domino theory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told that the dominoes, the countries between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Australia, were falling over or being pushed over by <span class="highlight">China</span>, our enemy, and that it was threatening this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, young Australians are still being killed and maimed in Vietnam and young Australians are still killing and maiming people in Vietnam in pursuit of the Government’s policies which have been based, so we have been told, on the threat of <span class="highlight">China</span> to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It realises now that <span class="highlight">China</span> is here, that it is not going to go away, however hard the Govern men may wish that it would go away, and that it is firmly and securely within the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever that means remains a mystery to me despite  Senator Byrne’s  efforts of explanation -  and the decision of the United Nations to seat the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in the General Assembly of the United Nations and on the Security Council in place of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and to expel the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> from the world body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand there is the conspiracy of Great Britain and the European Economic Community to join together, and on the other hand there is the conspiracy of the United Nations to admit the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and to expel the Government of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> which is based in Taipeh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall now go on to the other aspect of the conspiratorial situation in which according to the Democratic Labor Party we find ourselves and that is the decision of the United Nations to seat the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in the General Assembly and on the Security Council and to expel the so-called Republic of Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lest it be said that this is only the view of some dissident groups I think it should be noted who were among the 76 countries which voted for the admission of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the expulsion of Taiwan from the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly do not intend to name all the countries but it is rather interesting to find the following Western countries - most of which are regarded as being strongly anti-Communist - among the 76 countries which voted for <span class="highlight">China</span>’s admission and Taiwan’s expulsion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Byrne quoted various unnamed luminaries in Singapore, Malaysia and elsewhere who spoke about the very real threat they felt from the downward thrust of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, the perturbation that they felt about the presence of battleships from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and other aspects of the international Communist conspiracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were Afghanistan; Bhutan which has a common border with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>; Burma, which also borders <span class="highlight">China</span> and which has had considerable negotiations with <span class="highlight">China</span>, about the settlement of border problems; Ceylon, India and Laos. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It voted for the expulsion of Taiwan and the admission of <span class="highlight">China</span>, as did Malaysia where  Senator Byrne  was told about the dreadful threat of Communism from the north. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other countries which voted for the resolution were Nepal which is another country which borders <span class="highlight">China</span>; Pakistan and Singapore, another country which we have been told has been threatened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these countries voted for the admission of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the expulsion of the Taipeh Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the 35 nations which voted against the expulsion of the Taipeh Government and the admission of <span class="highlight">China</span>, one finds Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti - a great democracy - Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those countries are almost  completely dependent for their arms and the maintenance of their government upon American aid through the mis-named Alliance for Progress, lt is rather interesting to find that the threat of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> is felt so clearly in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Paraguay and Bolivia - where a new crowd of colonels has just taken over - but not felt in Singapore, Malaysia and Nepal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision of the United Nations General Assembly was that the Government in Peking was the government of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Government in Taipeh was not the government of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government in Taipeh claimed to be the government for the whole of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It claimed precisely the same territorial boundaries as those claimed by the Government in Peking - the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United Nations was called upon to decide which government was the government of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It said that the Government in Peking was the Government of <span class="highlight">China</span>, not the Government in Taipeh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reluctantly and belatedly after SOO Australian deaths in Vietnam the Australian Government came to the conclusion that it had to recognise that the Government in Peking was at least the government on the mainland of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But still it refused to recognise the simple point that there could not be 2 governments of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the sight of <span class="highlight">China</span>, the awakened giant, taking up its role in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Senator Wheeldon  tries to equate the votes of Singapore and Malaysia in the United Nations to the fact that they really do not fear subversion inspired from the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, I wish to say to him only that perhaps he should go and speak to the leaders of the countries of South East Asia - and go with his ears open, his eyes open and his mind open - because he will find that each of those countries expressed grave concern at the continued subversion, the continued terrorism being practised in their territory by Communist terrorists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The significance of the United Kingdom decision is that we now see being created in Europe a huge world ‘force, a new super power - indeed, it might be said, a power capable of exercising enormous economic, political and, if need be, military power in the world, lt will be a power equal to, if not greater than, that of the United States, of the Soviet Union, of the People’s Republic <span class="highlight">China</span>, if it seeks to be a super power, and of Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The matter of urgency refers to the implications for Australian defence and security of Britain’s decision to enter the European Economic Community and the decision of the United Nations to seat the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in the General Assembly of the United Nations and on the Security Council in place of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and to expel the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> from the world body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1955 the Australian Labor Party has advocated the recognition by all countries of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, lt has taken all these years before that recognition has come about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explicit in the definition of the principal part of the matter of urgency is the British decision to enter the European Economic Community, the decision of the United Nations to allow the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to take its place in the General Assembly and in the Security Council and the expulsion of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> from the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally, it should be noted that the United States has security treaties with Japan, the Philippines and the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, in addition to the ANZUS Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After the United Nations vote on the admission of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to that body, Secretary of State Rogers said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> continues to be a respected and valued member of the international community and the ties between us remain  unaffected  by the action of the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose that it is easy for us to stand aside and criticise small countries on the fringe of <span class="highlight">China</span>, a great and powerful country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps the world will settle down because of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s participation in the family of nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This should be everybody’s hope, but it will happen only if <span class="highlight">China</span> is a member of the family, behaves like a member of the family and stops subverting the democratic people who live on its southern borders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Quite conceivably the world should in this area fear not an invasion of Australia but a major clash between Communist Russia and Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My leader,  Senator Gair,  went on a television programme the other night and pointed out the necessity for it, with 2 major powers armed to the teeth as Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span> are in the Pacific area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I agree with the Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)  who expressed the hopes of us all about what the admission of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations may do for <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If honourable senators do not believe me they should believe Professor Arndt, a former member of the Australian Labor Party, who said that Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> might want to buy but does not have the international funds to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We regret that Israel was one of those countries which, perhaps was prompted by the same hopes as were expressed by the Leader of the Government in the Senate tonight that mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> would desert the policies that she has practised towards her neighbours up to date, would accept the responsibility of being a member of the family of nations and would not use its position against the democratic world but would come more closely towards a democratic way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What was the other inference that my statesman friend,  Senator Byrne,  drew from the admission  of  mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Little  pointed out, there are people in this Senate who cry aloud about the peaceful intentions of the Soviet Union and Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, with regard to Red <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Tibetans, the Indians and some others also would not believe them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other factor in the discussion in this matter of public importance is the seating of Red <span class="highlight">China</span> in the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I took note that  Senator Wheeldon  said that the choice was simply as to which Chinese government - the Red Chinese Government on the mainland or the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> Government on Formosa - would be preferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>which throws  a  dark shadow over the general pleasure that has been aroused by <span class="highlight">China</span>’s taking its rightful place in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Taiwanese invited trouble in the UN by insisting that they were the only true and lawful representatives of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This made it difficult to seat two Chinas in the Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest it is a very loose proposal because it refers to the implications for Australian defence and security of Britain’s entry into the European Economic Community and also raises the subject of the entry of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> into the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the agreement to admit the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations and related matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have said for many, many years that the Government has been lax in not supporting the claims by Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> to enter the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather vaguely every Government  speaker  tonight has said that he realises that Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> had to be admitted to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet persistently, throughout the years that Prince Souvanna Phouma, a Social Democrat, has been in power in Laos, he has maintained that Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> should be admitted to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Wheeldon  pointed out earlier, Laos is one of the countries to which we are giving aid although it has spasmodically had a very turbulent military experience, lt voted in favour of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s admission to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I found that most people wanted to reach some accommodation with Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody can say that either <span class="highlight">China</span> or the Soviet Union has given up the Leninist idea of world revolution but experience has clearly shown that both countries are pragmatic enough to accept agreements that they reach with major countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that <span class="highlight">China</span>’s experience will mean that it will not take any overt action and that its presence in the United Nations will bring a new peaceful era to the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my opinion, however much honourable senators lament the fact, that Taiwan is only a province of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At no time has it had any substantial claim to be the main government of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I accept that Taiwan will reach an accommodation with <span class="highlight">China</span> in the not distant future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my opinion that in a short time - 5 to 10 years - Taipeh will make the same sort of accommodation with <span class="highlight">China</span> as the United States has made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are realists we should try to reach the same sort of arrangements with <span class="highlight">China</span> and use these arrangements to further peace and not war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seeks to examine the implications to the defence and security of Australia of 2 epoch making events - the potential entry of Britain into the European Economic Community and the entry of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> into the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against that background we have a situation of another great emergence - the emergence of <span class="highlight">China</span> into the public sector of the nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let nobody think that the emergence of <span class="highlight">China</span> on the public scene is being accepted with unadulterated glee by the great super powers of this world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the emergence of <span class="highlight">China</span> has created in Japan the greatest turbulence in postwar Japanese history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same situation applies to Russia in relation to these matters, because Australia is geographically situated under an arc of 4 great powers - America, Russia, Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Japan is an offshore island system of Russia and is close to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that <span class="highlight">China</span> will come forward with bona fides in this world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said by the Opposition speakers - the earlier speakers in particular - that the Government has changed its views and suddenly discovered that <span class="highlight">China</span> ought to be welcome into the United Nations and that <span class="highlight">China</span> has been wanting to do this but has been blocked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>History shows that <span class="highlight">China</span> did not strive, over the great majority of those years, to enter the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In welcoming <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations I still urge this Parliament and our people to put on inquiry all motives of all nations that are now yeasting in their approach to this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the Senate that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> was proclaimed in 1949. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some 2 months ago  Mr Whitlam  said to Chou En-lai: ‘Is it possible that if an Australian Labor Party Prime Minister had visited <span class="highlight">China</span> 20 years ago all the destruction and slaughter in Vietnam could have been avoided?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that we will not do what we did in the 1930s - have sudden waves of optimism and sudden waves of pessimism - but will maintain a cautious hope that <span class="highlight">China</span> may move into the adulthood of nations and into a peaceful role in this world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For that reason I was pleased to listen to the contribution by  Senator Carrick  who welcomed these 2 great events - the entry of Great Britain into the European Economic Community and the entry of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> into the United Nations - because he indicated that here was represented the greatest hope for peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not have the detailed information with me, but for a long time Australia has enjoyed a quite substantial trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> in many commodities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>one of the realities is that the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is and has since the beginning of the organisation been a loyal  and  responsible member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Other countries, including the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, are spending mammoth amounts of money to provide defence forces, lt would be an act of utter stupidity if Australia, which is in  an unstable part of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I just wish to say that when the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> - Taiwan - was the subject of a levy, an intermediate basis was fixed for that government, having regard to its claims to represent the whole of the Chinese mainland and Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I point out to the honourable senator that the Government and particularly the Minister for Primary Industry have contended all along that the delay in sales of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> is probably due to commercial factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Which nations that voted for or against the admission of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations Organisation, and the expulsion of Taiwan, were financial members of the United Nations at the time of the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, would it not be justice to apply this principle to the membership of Taiwan and Red <span class="highlight">China</span> instead of the unworthy, despicable decision to expel a country which has done nothing to deserve such a fate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-84-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The terms of General Assembly Resolution 2758 (XXVI) emphatically rejected such a solution in the case of <span class="highlight">China</span>, and I think it is fair to say that an arrangement along the Soviet lines is at present not acceptable either to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> or to the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> (Taiwan). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-84-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think also it is even more incorrect to look on the problems which have to be resolved if we are to have peaceful relations with our neighbours in the Indian Ocean as being solely the result of the intervention of major powers, whether they be Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union or <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr President, I take the debate on (he tabling of this report as the opportunity for submitting that if we are lo survive with any respect from our neighbours and if we are to retain any reasonable relations with our neighbours we must show that we are just as concerned as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and <span class="highlight">China</span> appear to be about the interests of the great ‘ masses of people in this area who have suffered tremendous oppression througho.it the centuries and who continue to suffer oppression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>lt is interesting to note - I will conclude by making some observations about this matter - that Australia has again been placed in a ludicrous position as a result of the present visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> by  President  Nixon because, although I have already said that 1 believe the problems of the Indian Ocean area will be in the main resolved by the people who live in that area, there cannot be any doubt but that the relationships between the major powers are going to play a very important role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While on the one hand the Pope is offering prayers for the success of  President  Nixon’s visit to Peking and, at the other extreme, both India and the Soviet Union are expressing concern about the possibility of a new alliance between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the United States of America, we can get no intelligible statement whatsoever from this Government apart from the usual old anti-Communist claptrap it has been serving up for about 25 years that everything which is going on is the part of some Red plot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we examine the situation closely, we see that the frictions and wars which are taking place and which have taken place over the last 20 or 30 years have been justified by the American strategy or policy that if the Americans were able to create sufficient strength and power they could cause an undermining of the governments of the Soviet Union, <span class="highlight">China</span> and various other countries scattered throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-133">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said the other night, the potential enemy to Australia is not Russia, which is not interested in this region, nor <span class="highlight">China</span>, which has never had an interest in this region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been their espousing of the claim that <span class="highlight">China</span> has an interest in Australia which has kept that Government in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will recall that Ministers would get up one after the other and say that those who disagreed with them did not know what they were saying about <span class="highlight">China</span> and the domino theory, but today one does not hear any Ministers mentioning these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Japan will expand because it realises that its main competitor for power in the east is <span class="highlight">China</span> and that if <span class="highlight">China</span> becomes a nuclear nation Japan will also have to become a nuclear nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is looking at <span class="highlight">China</span> as if it is the country which is going to attack Australia when everybody else knows it should be looking at Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wish to conclude my remarks by saying that I still maintain that it does not matter two hoots how many Russians are present in the Indian Ocean because they are there only as a threat to <span class="highlight">China</span> and that the Government should be looking at the real threat further to the east, that is, Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would not draw that conclusion if one were to examine the speeches of  Senator Carrick  and  Senator Drake-Brockman;  one would imagine that the USSR and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> have gone into that area in defiance of the views of the nations in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If these countries can normalise relations with the Soviet Union I think it would be an act of statesmanship if our Prime Minister took the same sort of initiative regarding the Soviet Union as President Nixon is taking in his current discussions with the leaders of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If it is competent to express the view that <span class="highlight">China</span> and the United States of America can find the means to live in peace, I think that surely in Australia we can adopt a much more mature attitude instead of our normal behavioural pattern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs make inquiries to confirm or deny the allegation that the Leader of the Opposition in another place  (Mr Whitlam)  has clearly an J wilfully misled the people of Australia by claiming that during his discussion with the Premier of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, Chou En-lai, last year an indication was given that <span class="highlight">China</span> would join another Geneva conference? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that we should extend our activities to areas such as <span class="highlight">China</span> and Japan, set up plants similar to those established in South East Asia and sell our products in those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs noted that following official visits by them to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> the following Heads of State were removed from office by their countries: U Nu of Burma, Voroshilov of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Nkrumah of Ghana, Sukarno of Indonesia, Amin of Uganda, Sihanouk of <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately sales to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> on which we have been dependent for some years did not eventuate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> bought its wheat from Canada and we were left in the unfortunate position of having a large part of what we looked on as foreseeable sales taken from us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fortunately a market for Australian wheat became available in the Arab states which, although they were not prepared to take as much wheat as we would have exported to <span class="highlight">China</span>, bought sufficient to bring our total exports to 254 million bushels, leaving us with 125 million bushels which so far we have not been able to sell - although that does not mean that we will not be able to get rid of it before the end of the season. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wilkinson  mentioned that we had lost all wheat sales to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, but I remind the Senate that <span class="highlight">China</span> bought some of our 1970-71 crop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Figures which are available to me reveal that the United Kingdom was the biggest purchaser of Australian wheat, having bought wheat to the value of about $8lm; that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> bought wheat to the value of $57m; that the United Arab Republic, which has taken some of the wheat which formerly we would have expected to sell to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, bought wheat to the value of $56m; that Japan bought Australian wheat to the value of $40m, in round figures; and that Iraq purchased our wheat to the value of $22m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other matter with which I want to deal briefly is the reference to the potential markets which are supposed to exist in Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be foolish to believe that because certain changes are taking place in the international field there will naturally be a reversion to the former situation and we will sell more wheat to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, or even a reversion to the time when we made sales to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> out of a few Australian crops. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Actually, when we sold wheat to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> we sold it under completely different world marketing circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time the United States of America which had huge wheat surpluses- refused to sell to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because America was not in the market to sell to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> one of the most virile competitors, as far as Australian wheat sales were concerned, was removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This enhanced our prospects of meeting the emergency situation which forced Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> to buy wheat from us, and we cashed in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the greatest mistakes Australian producers could possibly make at this time is to think that because of a realignment of international feeling towards Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> there will naturally be a burst of buying of Australian primary products, whether it be wheat or anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that anybody who doubts what I say should study the figures of the imbalance of international trade which we have had in recent years with Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> compared to the very favourable trade balance which we have enjoyed with Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly Taiwan is a much smaller country in terms of population but in terms of international trade Taiwan trades much more, freely with the rest of the world than does Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, which does not intend’ to trade with any country if it can possibly avoid doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously it is the intention of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> to be self-supporting as far as possible and not to buy internationally any more than it is forced to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sound that warning because I feel that it is much better for Australia to seek the broader markets of the world and to sell smaller quantities to a greater number of countries, than to become committed to supplying huge quantities to a particularly shaky market which could possibly exist in any primary production trading with Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We sounded it when, for several years, the purchase of wheat by Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> was inordinately high and when the wheat acreage of this country was expanded out of all proportion to meet that market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason 1 mention those figures is because wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> have been mentioned today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a long time <span class="highlight">China</span> did play an important part in the disposal of the Australian wheat crop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a lot of comment about why we lost those <span class="highlight">China</span> sales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that we have to be logical in our approach to the reason why <span class="highlight">China</span> has reduced her purchases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today <span class="highlight">China</span> is aiming for self-sufficiency but she is not yet self-sufficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important factor which I want to mention is that whereas before we were exporting one-third of our exports to <span class="highlight">China</span>, this year without any <span class="highlight">China</span> sales we have had the greatest sales of wheat on record, sales which have amounted to some 394 million bushels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this is significant when we relate it to the situation when the panic buttons were being pressed by some people with regard to the loss of the <span class="highlight">China</span> sales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My remarks will be very brief; but, as the matter of our relationships with <span class="highlight">China</span> has been related to the subject of wheat, I feel that I should say a few words on this very important matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been freely said in our community, particularly in farming circles, that we will be able to sell large quantities of wheat to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> provided we take action which some people call ‘recognition’ and for which others use the nicer phrase of ‘normalising relations’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those days we were able to sell huge quantities of wheat to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> because one of our biggest potential competitors was not in the field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those days the United States had huge surpluses, was restricting production and on ideological grounds was refusing to sell wheat to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 can remember statements appearing in the Press in the middle of 1960s to the effect that in the United States there were certain pressures to get rid of its wheat surplus by throwing wheat on the market and making it available to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, if necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to face the situation that if we recognise Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> the United States is about to do the same and in those circumstances is a potential competitor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances I hope that the Australian farmer, whatever he thinks about Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, will not fall for the joke that we only have to perform the 3 ceremonial kow-tows in Peking and <span class="highlight">China</span> will write out a cheque for millions of dollars for our wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States has made it quite clear, following the Nixon visit to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, that it has no intention of abandoning its military arrangements in South East Asia and the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The United States of America maintains its global balance with the Soviet Union and it has a marked superiority in strategic nuclear strength vis-a-vis <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Department of Defence review points out, its strength in the Pacific Ocean is vast but American resources are not unlimited and the United States Administration has set conditions for its assumption of further responsibilities The United States, the Soviet Union, <span class="highlight">China</span> and Japan are exploring each other’s attitudes and examining the effect of initiatives taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the present situation of uncertainty about the intentions of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union, and the aggressive militancy of the North Vietnamese throughout IndoChina, and widespread insurgency in our northern neighbourhood, a positive Australian policy founded on an adequate defence effort and on defence arrangements or understandings with our neighbours may contribute to confidence and stability in the region in which we live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To lay stress on dangerous contingencies against which Australian defence efforts must steadily prepare over the longer term is not inconsistent with the hopes entertained by the  President  of the United States of progressively negotiating understandings which will reduce tensions among the  4  great powers: The Soviet Union, the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, the United States and Japan - and particularly among the  3  great military powers in this group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In South East Asia the impact of subversion and insurgency has been restricted by massive sacrifices of men and material on the part of many countries - not least the states of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> under attack from North Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>’s military power is of growing rather than lessening importance in Australian security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to return, however, to the subject of <span class="highlight">China</span>, whose military inventory contains a good deal more than nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Defence Review has pointed to the expansion of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s conventional naval and air forces and to the modernisation of all 3 of the Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While these forces are organised today essentially for the defence of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s borders, they already possess some offensive potential and it is clear that this capability will be developed further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the foundation for maintaining an effective balance of power in relation to a nuclear arming <span class="highlight">China</span> - a consideration of great concern for Australia in the years immediately ahead as will be seen from the description of the subject in the Defence Review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>France and <span class="highlight">China</span> are today the only countries testing nuclear explosions in the atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The overall world situation on radioactive fallout is, therefore, that the only new injections of this material into the atmosphere, currently, are from testing by France and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For example, there are the notes of the meeting of 2nd and 3rd October 1971 which deal with such matters as  President  Nixon’s announcement of his projected visit to <span class="highlight">China</span>, the world power situation, the basis of new policy orientations in <span class="highlight">China</span> and the United States and various other strategic matters of foreign policy, including policy submissions, defence policy, foreign policy and the industrial situation, which covers such things as the Australian Council of Trade Unions Congress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other topics included the age and paucity of Cabinet material, arbitration, amalgamations, the South African tour, <span class="highlight">China</span> policy and various other matters dealing with the ALP and the DLP. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>and (2) In speaking to the press in Tokyo on 12th October I recalled that during the past 10 years a pattern had developed whereby <span class="highlight">China</span>, to supplement its domestic wheat production, purchased hard wheat from Canada and soft wheat from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noted that in 1971 <span class="highlight">China</span> had very good harvests and did not need any soft wheat but I expressed the expectation that when they needed our wheat again they would buy it because, in practice, we had found that they did not mix politics with trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same interview I pointed out that the 2 countries who sold the most to <span class="highlight">China</span> - Japan and West Germany - did not have diplomatic relations with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs make inquiries to confirm or otherwise the allegation that the Leader of the Opposition in another place  (Mr Whitlam)  has clearly and wilfully misled the people of Australia by claiming that during his discussion with the Premier of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, Chou En-lai, last year an indication was given that <span class="highlight">China</span> would join another Geneva Conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Malta also had discussions with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Malta obtained a better deal from the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation powers and, on top of that, gained a bonus from continental <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever plans the Government tries to evolve for the wheat growers, honourable senators know as well as I do that Canada got the inside running as far as trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> in wheat is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now that President Nixon’s visit to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> has concluded, will a full statement regarding the visit be made to the Parliament; if so, when can this statement be expected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I expect it to include some reference to President Nixon’s visit to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government intend to establish a full diplomatic post in Hong Kong as a prelude to normalising relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>; if so, is the Minister aware that the Department of Foreign Affairs has in its employ only one fully-trained Chinese specialist and has decided to dispense with Chinese speaking staff in its <span class="highlight">China</span> section. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The Department has not decided to dispense with Chinese speaking staff in the section dealing with <span class="highlight">China</span>; the present <span class="highlight">China</span> Desk officer has a fluent knowledge of the Chinese language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: Is it a fact that, since the Government reviewed the list of exports on the strategic list last June, steel scrap, tin plate, pig iron and aluminium alloys to the value of $20m have been exported to <span class="highlight">China</span> from Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is a fact, does it mean that the Australian Government no longer considers <span class="highlight">China</span> a threat to Australia’s security? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether it is a fact that the British Foreign Secretary,  Sir Alec  Douglas-Home, on 8th May, called on the Soviet Union to join Britain in re-convening the Geneva conference which, in 1954, ended the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> war and of which Britain and the Soviet Union were co-chairmen? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it further a fact that Britain, on 12th May, made a direct approach to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in Peking to help in reconvening that conference? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these are facts, has there been any response by the Soviet Union or the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to this earnest attempt by Britain to bring about a just peace in Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment I have no information upon which I could make a statement about the reference to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate discuss the loss of wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> as a result of the attitude of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They related to the loss of wheat sales to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> - referred to by the Government as Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> in the political context but as Continental <span class="highlight">China</span> in the context of trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the last count I think the population of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> was over 800 million. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the countries was Ireland, another was the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, and there were 14 others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The country that attracted most attention at that time was, of course, the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The government of the day never lost an opportunity to say to us: ‘You are wanting to recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had to live from 1955 until the last session of the United Nations to see the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> take its place in that body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that it is an irony of the universe that next to India is the greatest country in the world, in terms of population - <span class="highlight">China</span> - which adheres to a communist system of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I say, in 1955 when we in the Australian Labor Party said that all nations should be admitted to the United Nations and mentioned the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> we handed to our opponents a stick with which to beat us over the head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before that we divided up Ireland and Korea; <span class="highlight">China</span> divided up itself; and we divided up Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that as a background to the more specific point I put in my motion - I again emphasise that it was framed 12 months ago - involving the whole question of wheat sales to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia would have been in trouble with regard to wheat a long time ago if it had not been for its wheat sales to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Maisey,  who is now a member of Parliament - the honourable member for Moore - was one of the first members of the Wheat Board to suggest selling wheat to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time I remember all kinds of debates raging about whether the sale was moral, whether we should sell the wheat, whether we should not sell the wheat, whether the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> was importing wheat and reselling it, or whether it was holding the imported wheat and selling its rice to other countries to flood the rice bowl in Burma, Vietnam and Thailand and so again use the trade-politico situation which, as I mentioned, the Democratic Labor Party has underlined from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Questions asked mainly by members of the Liberal Party, have been trying to point out that the situation was not as I have stated it and that the fact that Canada had recognised the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> had nothing to do with the fact that <span class="highlight">China</span> was buying wheat from Canada and not from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is undoubtedly true that during the last 18 months to 2 years <span class="highlight">China</span> has been in a strong position because it has had good seasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That does not alter the fact that at the same time it has had to import wheat and has moved to the Canadian prairies rather than to Australia because Canada had recognised <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Canada came to an agreement with <span class="highlight">China</span>, getting over the difficulties of Taiwan, which made both sides reasonably happy to sign a document on this level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That leaves unanswered the question whether, if we had recognised the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> at the same time as the Canadians did, the extra imports that <span class="highlight">China</span> needed in spite of its good seasons would have been divided equally, mathematically or by some other formula between our sister dominion Canada and ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Things have moved a long way since the days when the Labor Party was beaten over the head by the Liberal Government because we advocated the recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand the position, under certain circumstances the Liberals will talk turkey or chow mein, whatever the appropriate word is, with the Chinese on whether Australia should recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>, at the same time keeping open all kinds of options. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>World opinion has finally pushed the Liberals into a situation in which they are willing to have discussions with Mao Tse-tung and his people to decide whether they will recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view, if we recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, there is no doubt that there will be a resurgence of trade with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we start doing a deal, if I can use those capitalistic words, with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, we will be doing a deal with a country which has the largest population in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> has not developed, although we had a lot of utterances about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the McMahon Government still maintaining an international stance that there is only one lawful government of all <span class="highlight">China</span>, including mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does it still recognise the Chiang Kai-shek regime as the only government of all <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does it still refuse to recognise in any way the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> as being the lawful government of any part of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and concerns recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not a fact that the Australian Government in its recent ministerial statement on foreign affairs indicated its willingness to approach the matter of recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> on the same criteria as have been invariably applied to recognition by and between nations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be recalled that in the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, which I read to the Senate on the 9th of this month, it was said that Australia’s position was that we were willing to recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and exchange diplomatic representatives in accordance with normal international practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement then went on to say that certain conditions were stipulated by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, one of which was that we should acknowledge it as the sole legal government of <span class="highlight">China</span> and as having sovereignty over Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs, <span class="highlight">China</span> section, has dropped from five to two over the last 2 months? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the importance of improving our relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>, if we are to regain the loss of exports, particularly of wheat, does the Minister regard the situation as being critical? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What action does the Minister intend taking to ensure that the staff of the Department’s <span class="highlight">China</span> Section is restored to at least its previous strength? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">China</span>/Korea Section of the Department of Foreign Affairs is normally staffed by six officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Department is fully conscious of the need to ensure that the <span class="highlight">China</span>/Korea Section is fully staffed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As both Russia, a traditional, if ill-informed, critic, and <span class="highlight">China</span> were members of the 6-man committee, is this report a remarkable commendation of the Federal Government’s handling of its Trust responsibilities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have as a classic example the case not only of Russia but also that of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ask the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs: Is it a fact that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> has conducted at least 14 atmospheric nuclear tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as we know <span class="highlight">China</span> has carried out 14 nuclear tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the Government reviewed the list of exports on the strategic list last June have sales of steel scrap, tinplate, pig iron, and aluminium alloys, to the value of $20m been exported to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> from Australia; if so, does the Government no longer consider that <span class="highlight">China</span> is a threat to Australian security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-81-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs recall his statement yesterday welcoming advice as to any statement made by the Australian Labor Party calling on <span class="highlight">China</span> to refrain from nuclear testing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I said yesterday that 1 had no information whatever on any Labor spokesman or parliamentarian cri ticising <span class="highlight">China</span> for its conduct of nuclear tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has his attention been drawn to an article by  Mr Whitlam  in the Sydney Morning Herald’ of today’s date on the subject of <span class="highlight">China</span> and Japan in which  Mr Whitlam  urges that Australia give gratuitous advice to Japan to abandon the 15 million people of Taiwan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not a fact that the countries of South East Asia, conscious of the desire of small nations to survive and remain free, have rejected the course of agreeing to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span> by paying the price of sacrificing the sovereignty of Taiwan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will honourable senators forgive me this remark and not think that I am partisan on this matter, but I wish that something could be done to stop the drug traffic from countries such as <span class="highlight">China</span> and Burma and similar areas of the world, whence the great flood of narcotics comes at this moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This morning at question time I answered questions by  Senator Wriedt  and  Senator Murphy  concerning the expression by any representative of the Australian Labor Party of its point of view in opposition to nuclear tests by Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Murphy  has since drawn my attention to 3 or 4 such instances in the records of this Parliament and I wish to direct them to the attention of honourable senators in fairness to the Opposition and to withdraw any inference that could be drawn from my remarks that the Opposition had not expressed its disapproval of nuclear tests specifically in relation to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When, and in what manner, have protests been made by the Commonwealth against nuclear tests or proposed nuclear tests by (a) France, and (b) <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the explosion a few days ago of a Chinese nuclear device causing a spread of radioactivity outside the territory of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Whitlam  said in relation to his visit to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> that he had discussed 3 matters on which there were basic disagreements between the Chinese Government and the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What is the Government’s reaction to the assurance given by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to the Canadian Government that Canada can count on <span class="highlight">China</span> as a long term customer for wheat? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, how does this huge trade figure compare with the amount that the Australian Government’s refusal to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span> has cost the wheat farmers of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An assurance similar to that mentioned by the honourable senator was given in July last year by <span class="highlight">China</span> to Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not represent a significant departure from established practice on the part of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the past few years <span class="highlight">China</span> has negotiated first with Canada and later with other suppliers to which it turned for additional requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A delegation visited <span class="highlight">China</span> late last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the view which the Government took when invitations were extended to basketball teams from Taiwan and table tennis teams from <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ‘Canberra Times’ of 22nd August published a scathing indictment of certain government policies, criticised ‘Australian Foreign Policy’, a Liberal publication, 1972 edition, and then made reference to Australia’s nonrecognition of <span class="highlight">China</span> and its effect on our wheat exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also is the Minister aware that 3 companies making vitreous <span class="highlight">china</span>  -  R. Fowler Limited, Doulton Potteries Pty Limited and Armitage Ware Limited - each made similar price rises on the same day on 3 occasions since early last year resulting in price increases in these articles of approximately 36 per cent in that time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that Government officials believe that Australia’s chances of re-entering the Chinese wheat market could be destroyed by a domestic shortage and the Government’s failure to recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, and that <span class="highlight">China</span> is now prepared to buy Australia’s wheat despite past political differences? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, is it a fact that Australia has no wheat to sell and that officials are worried that by the time stocks become available <span class="highlight">China</span> will have bought elsewhere? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that rural production in <span class="highlight">China</span> in recent times has not been as good as in past years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it is quite likely that <span class="highlight">China</span> will be forced on the world market to purchase more wheat and then Australia stands a good chance of selling wheat to that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I say that the sale of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> is not a consideration at all as far as politics are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact,I am reminded as I hear the interjection, that the Australian Labor Party is seeking to make a great feature out of the fact that it would go so far as to sacrifice friends in the Pacific - Taiwan and others - to obtain recognition from the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the application by Bangladesh, a newly independent country, to join the United Nations organisation vetoed by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, a nation which the Australian Labor Party is anxious to recognise unconditionally? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for Foreign Affairs aware of any representations or protests from the Australian Labor Party against the action of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For reasons which I should think would be fairly clear to most students of this situation, the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> did enter its first veto on the question whether Bangladesh should be admitted to membership of the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  blamed the Australian Labor Party because Canada recognised <span class="highlight">China</span> diplomatically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not follow his reasoning but he said it was the responsibility of the Labor movement that <span class="highlight">China</span> did not place its wheat order with Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we of the Labor movement since 1951 have been advocating recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why has this Government not sent one of its senior Ministers to <span class="highlight">China</span> to conduct negotiations for diplomatic recognition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Had the present Commonwealth Government not been using the communist bogey as an election issue year after year and created bad relations with Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, as it termed that country in those days- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> in mind, can the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs inform the Senate whether Australia’s foreign policy has in any way inhibited the success of our international trading? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happens in the Soviet Union or in <span class="highlight">China</span> ought not to be held up as an example. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government any information as to whether Lin Piao, former Deputy Premier of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, is alive or dead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (2)In the absence of any authoritative statement from the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, it is not possible to say with certainty whether Lin Piao is dead or how he might have died. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to him that the other day in relation to a similar question on the sale of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> I said that the Chinese were very shrewd businessmen and that they would buy in the world market when they were ready to buy and when prices, freight rates and all other things were right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also indicated to the Senate at that time that I had been informed that <span class="highlight">China</span> was having a bad season in relation to its rice crop, that I believed <span class="highlight">China</span> would be coming on the world markets for wheat and that I hoped Australia would receive an order for wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when governments of the Left such as Communist Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span> do far worse, there is a great silence and protection the whole time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember that on one occasion when  Senator Gorton,  as he then was, was the representative in this chamber of the Minister for Foreign Affairs he drew a very good distinction between the territorial expansions of the super communist powers, <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and those of Romania and Yugoslavia, which he put in a different category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Japan and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> provides further evidence of the failure of this Government’s policy towards the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of this new development, does the Government intend to do anything to lessen its isolation from its neighbours which results from its refusal to recognise the existence of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Japanese Government has kept the Australian Government fully informed of the development of its policy towards the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we will continue our present policy of seeking the progressive normalisation of bilateral relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, moving at all times with prudent caution and being guided by a careful assessment of Australia’s national interests, including the need to bear in mind the interests and concerns of our friends and neighbours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether it is a fact that last week the Government of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> placed an order in the United States for $28m worth of wheat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the Government of the United States has repeatedly refused to grant diplomatic recognition to the Government of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this order placed by <span class="highlight">China</span> in the United States rebut the furphy spread by the Australian Labor Party that Red <span class="highlight">China</span> is refusing lo buy our wheat only because the Australian Government has so far declined to grant <span class="highlight">China</span> diplomatic recognition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to whether the conclusion he draws should be supported responsibly in the Senate, I prefer that it be the subject of very careful examination because the reasons motivating the trade policies of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> are apt to be very complex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hear members of his Party time and again in this place asking why we are not trading more with <span class="highlight">China</span> and why we have not people stationed there making representations on our behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At this very moment  Mr Tanaka  is in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pipes might be made from <span class="highlight">China</span>’s iron ore. Those people who have been roaming this chamber for a long time screaming that Australia should conduct more trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> might find that one of the very favourable markets that we have developed in the Pacific is related to the buying of pipes from Japan and that we do not have so much trade for <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We lost trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> because the Prime Minister and other senior Cabinet Ministers decided that we did not need the trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Tonight we heard reference to what .vas said to be the scandal of trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> over the period since the late 1950s have been negotiated by the Australian Wheat Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, our colleague in another place, the honourable member for Moore, was one of the members of the Wheat Board who were sent to <span class="highlight">China</span> by the Board to negotiate the initial sales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just want to say that in this sessional period a number of questions on the matter of wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> have been directed to me as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out at that time that the prospects of agriculture in <span class="highlight">China</span> had not been good in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> has been buying a high quality wheat from Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>wheat makes the best noodles of any wheat in the world.It is for that reason that I believe <span class="highlight">China</span> has come to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On numerous occasions since then Wheat Board representatives have been to <span class="highlight">China</span> trying to negotiate sales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some months ago they returned to <span class="highlight">China</span> and negotiated a sale, but an announcement of it was not made until the Chinese had fixed up everything in the way of shipping freights and dates of delivery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the attention of the Minister been drawn to an item in this morning’s Press announcing the sale by the Australian Wheat Board of wheat worth $60m to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this sale follow the recent sale of wheat worth $28m by the United States of America to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that both Australian and the United States refused diplomatic recognition of Red <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do these 2 sales confirm the statement made by the  Deputy  Prime Minister,  Mr Anthony,  that wheat trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> is independent of diplomatic recognition and rebut the statements of certain political tourists to the contrary? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true also, as I stated in answer to a question from  Senator Drury  on the same topic, that these sales to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> are not dependent on recognition of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time when I answered that question I pointed out that Australia had continued over a long period to make sales of alumina and sugar to <span class="highlight">China</span> despite the fact that wheat sales to that country were not being made at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sales are not dependent on political recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>, as has been borne out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the successful sale of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>, what amount of wheat will the Australian Wheat Board have left to sell to other markets? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the Australian Wheat Board clinched the deal with <span class="highlight">China</span> have any other potential sales of wheat been declined? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The wheat sold to <span class="highlight">China</span>, to which the honourable senator referred, will come from the 1972-73 pool or harvest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be recalled that 2 or 3 days ago  Senator Hannan  addressed a question to me which referred to sales of wheat by the United States to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He asked for a comment on whether Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> governed its commercial international transactions by foreign policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But now we come into the Australian scene where we have maintained consistently the policy that we will seek progressive normalisation of bilateral relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, moving at all times with prudent and careful assessment of Australia’s national interests, including the need to bear in mind the interests and concerns of our friends and neighbours, particularly with regard to South East Asian countries, and of course our relations with Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it becomes abundantly clear and  a  most important fact to remember in the maintenance of Australia’s foreign policy in this respect that we seek a normalisation of foreign relations with Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> but not at the expense of our own real interests or those of neighbouring countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is apparent that commercial considerations will govern trade, rather than the foreign policy of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important for me, standing here as Minister representing the Government, to say this because an attempt was made by the Leader of the Australian Labor Party last year to woo the head of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> and to seek an adoption by him of Australian Labor Party policy as a means of influencing the Australian electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question which refers to the recent sales of wheat to Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister noted the concern which has been expressed by Japan and at least one other country which has been a customer for Australian wheat that regular supplies of wheat to them as customers might be interrupted if Australia resumes the large scale sales of wheat to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> which occurred some years ago? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the honourable senator would be one of the first to admit that over the years the Australian Wheat Board has done a tremendous job, particularly in the last few years, after cessation of continued sales to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not in a position to say categorically the extent of the testing that has been conducted by Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the suggestion of  Senator Prowse  that if protests are to be made in relation to what the French Government is doing, protests should be made in relation to what the Government of Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> or other nations are doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there are the recent trade agreements negotiated between Japan and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been advocated in this chamber that our country should rapidly expand, wherever possible, its trade with other countries with which we have not been trading for a considerable time, such as Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, as Mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> was traditionally a source of supply of ore to the Japanese steel industry in the past and as new trade pacts and agreements have now been consummated between those countries in an entirely new approach that we can only expect will expand and broaden there is no guarantee that by the time of the consummation of the contract awarded by the Australian Gas Light Co,, to Japan the iron ore in the pipes will be Australian ore. Japan could not give that guarantee to Australia any more than it could give it to some other supplier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry refers to reports of considerable concern being expressed in Japan at the resumption of large scale wheat sales by Australia to <span class="highlight">China</span> and of fears that these sales may mean that supplies may not be available to the Japanese market which has been opened up in the last few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bearing in mind that the wheat crisis of several years ago was caused by over-emphasis on vast sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> which were cut off without warning, and also bearing in mind that the wheat crisis was alleviated by diversifying our sales to other countries such as Japan, can we be assured that our wheat authorities will act to keep our new customers, at least as a safety provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would accept that the Australian Wheat Board would have been considering carefully its old customers, as well as its new customers, at the time of making the sale to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not finished because 1 suppose that the greatest implication of the link between the Communist Party and the Labor Party, if one wanted to establish it in this same guilt by association method which  Senator James  McClelland used, is to point to the Labor Party’s support for communist aggression in Vietnam - the support for the North Vietnamese Government which is backed by Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> and by the Soviet Union - and to the attitude which would favour victory in South Vietnam to the North Vietnamese against the South Vietnamese, the Loatians, the Cambodians, the Americans and all our allies to our north who have engaged with us in supporting the right of self determination of the South Vietnamese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As air travel continues to expand, somebody may attempt to use a violent form of action such as hijacking to travel from mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand, the aircraft could have been hijacked from Chile or from mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a selling market if we are prepared to face up to the problem that exists, that is if we are prepared to send marketing people to <span class="highlight">China</span>, Russia and other countries that need wool and to sell our product to them just as we sell our wheat and dried fruits on a basis of a fair return for the efforts made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contingent upon the re-appointment of the legislative and general purpose standing committees, I shall move: That there be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence the following matters - All matters relating to the recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the status of Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730227_senate_28_s55/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this failure to protest against <span class="highlight">China</span> just another example of the  snivellingly  obsequious nature of the Whitlam Government’s so-called independent foreign policy- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He conceded - perhaps these are my words and not his - that he was quite wrong and that the most definite and heavy protests had been made by members of the Austraiian Labor Party against the nuclear tests in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Government claims that the agreement with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is similar to the Canadian formula, will the Government provide to the Parliament full details of the formulas for recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> adopted by Canada, Japan, West Germany, Zaire, Malagasy, Jamaica and Chad? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It refers to the statements made by  Mr Francis  James alleging that he was arrested and imprisoned without trial, tortured, denied access to representation and his health gravely affected in Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In default of such action will the Government warn intending travellers to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> that the Commonwealth Government accepts no responsibility for the freedom and safety of Australian travellers there? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, we have seen how it races off to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An individual has just come out of <span class="highlight">China</span>; I refer to one Francis James. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was not one word of protest to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> about the condition in which he came out of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I read in the Australian Press that the Australian basketballers had approached the Government with a view to visiting Taiwan and were told that they must not go to Taiwan but were directed - ‘directed’ is the word that was used in the newspapers, and I find it hard to believe that that word was used - to go to communist <span class="highlight">China</span> instead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did so because our trade with Taiwan has been if anything a bit better than has our trade with Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, despite the big discrepancy in the populations of those  2  countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is no ban on trade with the Taiwanese but if instead, we are chasing their trade ali we can because it has been, and is, worth more than the trade of the whole of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>, why are we holding up our hands and saying that we cannot permit an Australian team to go to Taiwan to play basketball? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reached the stage where a team of basketballers is told by thu Government that it must not accept an invitation to go to Taiwan but should go to Red <span class="highlight">China</span> instead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is that we have made the choice to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a province of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have recognised the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and wc have had a formula in regard to Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Minister’s answer that Taiwan was a province of <span class="highlight">China</span>, can he inform the Senate whether that view was held by bis Party before the 10th October celebrations at the Embassy of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> where, at the invitation of  His Excellency  Ambassador Chen, many Labor members attended and expressed by their presence and enjoyment of the hospitality generously provided, their support for Taiwan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Australian Labor Party members there present join in the toast to the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, which recognised that Taiwan was a separate entity to the Communist Government of <span class="highlight">China</span>, or did’ -they refuse to drink? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not a fact that Bangladesh is a break-away area from Pakistan, just as the people of Taiwan recognise that they are a break-away area from <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will explain once again that the situation regarding <span class="highlight">China</span> and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government of Taiwan has claimed to be the Government of the whole of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> has made a similar claim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have recognised the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and have taken note of its view that Taiwan is one of its provinces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ls it not a fact that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> has had no control or authority over Taiwan since 1949? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Ministers attention been drawn to an eco  nomic and political treatise by Professor Hans Arndt, who resigned from the Labor Party over  Mr Whitlam’*  performance in <span class="highlight">China</span>, dealing with what the professor called the myth of <span class="highlight">China</span> trade? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Government holding any hopes of substantial trade relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Government aware that the overseas trade figures for Taiwan are slightly better than those for the whole of Red <span class="highlight">China</span> and mat such trade is conducted by free men? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the aspect of trade, the only thing I have seen recently was a report that the Victorian Liberal Minister,  Mr Byrne,  seemed to think that trade would flourish between Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is similar to’ the Canadian formula, win the Government provide to the Parliament full details of the formulas for recognition of the Peopled Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> adopted by Canada, Japan, West Germany; Zaire, Malagasy, Jamaica and Chad? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now ask the Minister: Will he lay on the table of the Senate the formulas for recognition of  the  People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> adopted by Canada, Japan, West Germany, Zaire, Malagasy,- Jamaica and Chad? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister, in the interests of ‘open Government’, cause to be tabled in the Senate the communications which passed between the Australian Ambassador in Paris and the Government during negotiations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-84-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The actual terms and conditions agreed to by Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span> regarding mutual recognition and the establishment of diplomatic relations were fully set out in my statement of 22nd December 1972, and in the joint communique released at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-84-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear from the honourable senator’s question that he believes there to be some secret agreements between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span> not mentioned in the joint, communique. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-84-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The negotiations with <span class="highlight">China</span> were confined narrowly to the question of recognition and diplomatic relations and to related questions associated with the status of Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-84-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Government aware that Taiwan’s rapidly growing free enterprise economy, whose foreign trade is far greater than that of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, offers growing trade opportunities for Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Government aware of the arrangements made by Japan, Canada and other nations which have recognised the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to retain trade, cultural and other ties with Taiwan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have made up our minds, as have most countries in the world, to recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then how and why did the Minister approve of the sale of merino rams to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> at the time that he did? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would he have approved a sale to a non-Communist country or were there political bias and motivation in the sale to <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision was taken on my recommendation with the concurrence of the Prime Minister to export the rams to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact that they were bound for the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> was quite irrelevant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to an editorial in the ‘People’s Daily’ the official journal of the Chinese Communist Party, as reported in English by the New <span class="highlight">China</span> Newsagency dated, Peking, 24th December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If not, has the Government protested to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> against the deliberate misrepresentation of Australian Government policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 have seen some comments made by  Senator Sim  in the newspaper that tried to draw the analogy that, because we had recognised the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and because we had taken certain other actions, including action in regard to Rhodesia, in some way this was associated with the talks between the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Government of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The entire negotiations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> dealt with the setting up of diplomatic relations, what would be the position in regard to properties in Australia and such matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is not something which was initiated when the Labor Government came to power; the previous Government was already taking steps in this direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How will <span class="highlight">China</span> view Australia as a fair and responsible friend when, after having had a small neighbour and good friend for some 14 or 15 years, Australia immediately, on recognising a larger and - I acknowledge - a more important nation in the world, cuts our ties with that good friend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So insensitive was  Mr Whitlam,  our Prime Minister and our part-time Foreign Minister to an understanding of Indonesian history that whilst making a proper gesture of putting flower petals on the graves of the dead generals, he talked about bringing mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> into a rapprochement with Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>whether at a time when the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics were giving actual military aid to the forces of North Korea then engaged in hostilities against the Australian troops in the field, Wilfred Burchett then had any professional relationship, remunerated or not, with either of those Governments; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that the Government of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> has consented to the exchange of official representatives with the United States of America without exacting the slightest concession in regard to the recognition by the United States of the Nationalist Chinese regime in Taiwan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If so, does the Minister, now agree that the Government was most unwise in severing Australia’s diplomatic relations with the non-communist Government of Nationalist <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But at the same time the honourable senator must realise, as everybody does, that now that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is being recognised in the area, and now that Hanoi is being recognised in the area, the situation will arise where other voices in the whole area will have to be heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What were the references to Taiwan contained in the similar Joint Communiques establishing diplomatic relations between Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> and Canada and Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> and those non-Communist countries with which it established diplomatic relations in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The position is that neither Taiwan nor the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> would allow Australia or any other country even to try to recognise both, if it wanted to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a confused question ranging from Hanoi to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not see any point in waiting especially as the job of rehabilitating both North and South Vietnam and the rest of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> will be a tremendous job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our attitude to aid is that it will be given to the whole of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> when that is possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Government be prepared to adopt the same standards of morality towards <span class="highlight">China</span> as towards France? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask: Upon the information received from his expert advisers will the AttorneyGeneral confirm the statement made by the Prime Minister yesterday that Australia is not, in the Prime Minister’s words, ‘discernibly affected by nuclear tests by <span class="highlight">China</span>’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the proposed trade mission to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in May this year, which is to be headed by  Dr Cairns  and  Sir Ian  McLennan, and which is to establish friendly and valuable relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggestion was that the trip be enlarged and that the mission go not only to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> but also to the other 2 places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has there been any protest from Opposition members to the inclusion of  Mr Kibel,  referred to by  Senator Sim  as a Manchester Jew, as a member of the trade delegation of prominent leaders of commerce and industry which will accompany  Dr Cairns  when he visits <span class="highlight">China</span> in May of this year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Government aware that the voice of the Malayan revolution radio, located in southern <span class="highlight">China</span>, is broadcasting  to  Malaysia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government believe that the support of insurgency in Thailand and Malaysia by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and North Vietnam serves the interests of peace and stability in the region? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Prime Minister has given gratuitous advice to Thailand, will he now give advice to <span class="highlight">China</span> and North Vietnam that in the interests of peace and stability and in support of the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, they  should  mind their own business? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does he agree that the Government in Peking has established for many years its right to control the area of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that both Taiwan and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> will not accept recognition from countries, and if the honourable senator is interested I have here a list showing that not one country recognises both Taiwan and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Taiwanese Government claims to be the legal government of the whole of <span class="highlight">China</span> and does not accept that its people are on the island of Taiwan indefinitely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it comes to recognition, every country is forced to make up its mind according to the dictates of the governments of both Taiwan and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has his attention been drawn to the impending visit of a representative group of Australian capitalists to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> seeking trade relations with that country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The question asked by  Senator Gietzelt  highlights a very sensible approach by the British Government and its interest to improve its trade relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reply to the second part of the honourable senator’s question, I will not be included in the trade mission which will be going to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>107 that the Australian Government, since coming to office, has not communicated in any way with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> regarding past or future nuclear testing by that country, why has it not done so? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot give any guarantee that we will or will not do so, or what subjects will be discussed with other countries, including the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What they hope to do is get out the old Mccarthyite tactics which they found so successful during the 1950s when they tried to terrify people with their red arrows coming down from <span class="highlight">China</span>, descending on Perth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know very well that any sensible statesman in the world is prepared to talk to <span class="highlight">China</span>, North Vietnam and the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even General Franco, the idol and hero of the DLP, has entered into diplomatic relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> on precisely the same terms as those on which Australia has entered into diplomatic relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, they can try to adapt themselves to a changing world and a higher level of education in this country, knowing that there are now people who do not believe the sort of twaddle they were talking in 1949 about socialism leading to communism, <span class="highlight">China</span> being an agent of Russia, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indonesia being an agent of <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Australian Labor Party being an agent of Indonesia and the sort of stuff that was served up for years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, why does not the Government apply the same principle to <span class="highlight">China</span> as to France and be prepared to take the same legal action against <span class="highlight">China</span> as has been threatened against France? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prime Minister that the reason the Government cannot take legal action against <span class="highlight">China</span> is that we are not discernibly affected? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he agree that many of Australia’s friends are affected by <span class="highlight">China</span>’s testing of nuclear weapons and deserve support, or is it a case, as suggested in a newspaper editorial, of let them fry with Chou En-Iai? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday I received a reply from the Prime Minister which said that in the case of visits from Taiwan members of sporting bodies could come only as individuals and not as a team; secondly, that they must dissociate themselves from their own Government; thirdly, they could not call themselves a Taiwanese team; fourthly, they could not call themselves a team from <span class="highlight">China</span>; and fifthly, they could not call themselves a Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> team. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and therefore we do not accept people coming from Taiwan and claiming to represent the Government of <span class="highlight">China</span> or putting themselves in an official position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer also to the current heavyweight trade tour about to visit Red <span class="highlight">China</span> from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that Taiwan’s overseas trade is many millions of dollars greater than that of Red <span class="highlight">China</span>, will the Minister extend the tickets and the time of this delegation so that it may  inlude  Taiwan in its endeavours? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was asked yesterday about the trade mission to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and I said I would pass the question on for consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I doubt whether it was necessary for us to throw Taiwan out of Australia in our hurry to embrace the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-65">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undoubtedly the time was coming when <span class="highlight">China</span> would be recognised, whatever that word may mean - whether it is United Nations recognition or Australian recognition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-65">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that <span class="highlight">China</span> has shown very little interest in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-65">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although <span class="highlight">China</span> had not taken this interest, Australia took action to recognise that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-65">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could refer to the reply received from Indonesia, a country which for so many years had experienced infiltration by communists, to the suggestion by the Government of this small nation of Australia that there should be some pact within this area which should embrace Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-65">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have this multi-polar situation involving countries like the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, Japan, Russia, the USA and England. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear criticisms in the Senate day after day by way of questions because the Government has recognised the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Government of North Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The phrase we used to hear for years about the containment of <span class="highlight">China</span> is the very sort of thing that causes war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What military might have we compared to countries such as Russia, <span class="highlight">China</span>, the United States of America and Great Britain? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At long last the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is being recognised by the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basically this is how we have to move on our own in the Indio-<span class="highlight">China</span> area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation in the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> area, as far as Australia is concerned, will be just that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can we take seriously the proposal to export processed vegetable products from this country to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> which has one of the lowest standards of living on earth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Insofar as the Chinese market is concerned, I understand that the growers have hopes of obtaining a market in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the time I pointed out to them that they should not rely unduly on the prospects in respect of <span class="highlight">China</span>, for many reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that there will be great, expansion in Australia’s trade with less well known trading areas such as Russia and- <span class="highlight">China</span>, it is hoped - I do not hold much optimism myself, I might say in passing, for a great acceleration in trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> but, nonetheless, there will be some expansion - and Eastern European countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Department of Foreign Affairs on 20th December 1972 warned that, when Australia recognised the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, persons then purchasing property in Australia from ‘the Government (or Embassy or Consulates) of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>’ risked having their title challenged on the ground that the property belonged to the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> which had not authorised sale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government knows of no instance or country in the last 20 years in which <span class="highlight">China</span> has acted in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the continual barrage of highly critical statements emanating from the Australian Ambassador designate to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>,  Dr Fitzgerald. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>will a visit to Taiwan be included in the itinerary of the forthcoming Trade Mission to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trade Mission to <span class="highlight">China</span> - The forthcoming Government trade mission to <span class="highlight">China</span> will not visit Taiwan but, as has been previously indicated in the Senate, there are no hindrances to individual Australian businessmen or groups of businessmen visiting Taiwan in connection with trade with Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Did representatives of the Taiwan Port Authorities hold negotiations with the Brisbane shipbuilding yard, Index Slipway and Engineering Pty Ltd, with a view to placing orders worth approximately $A1,250,000 prior to Australia recognising Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the negotiations cease immediately Australia signed the joint communique with Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the proposed trade mission to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in May this year, which is to be headed by  Dr Cairns  and  Sir Ian  McLellan, and which is to establish friendly and valuable relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, this year a delegation is going to <span class="highlight">China</span> and another is going to Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could well be that a member of, for instance, the Country Party in the Senate is on a trip to <span class="highlight">China</span> and that another member of the Country Party is on a trip to the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Be that as it may, it could well be that a member of the Australian Democratic Labor Party is on a trip to <span class="highlight">China</span> or to the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Arrangements were made by the Australian Broadcasting Commission for an Australian Broadcasting Commission journalist, John Pennlington, and a camerman from Hong Kong to accompany to Peking  Dr Fitzgerald,  the recently appointed Australian Ambassador to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say that I have just been advised that the Australian Broadcasting Commission has received advice from <span class="highlight">China</span> that  Mr Pennlington  and the cameraman have now had their visas extended to the end of May to enable the ABC to cover the visit of a Government trade mission, which will be led by the Minister for Overseas Trade,  Dr J.

    <p>The Chinese Government has also allowed  Mr Pennlington  and the cameraman to tour outside Peking and at the moment they are touring central <span class="highlight">China</span> for the purposes of sending to Australia news reports, cable reports and film about <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In reply to the interjection of the honourable senator, I think it is important that the people of other countries - France, <span class="highlight">China</span> or anywhere else - should be aware of the feelings of other people in relation to the tests and also the view which has been taken about the danger of those tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As he has indicated that the French Government was good enough to give him television time to explain the attitude of Australia to French nuclear testing, will the Attorney-General direct  Dr Stephen  Fitzgerald, the Australian Ambassador to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, immediately to request that Government to give him radio time in <span class="highlight">China</span> to express Australia’s deep opposition to the continued testing by <span class="highlight">China</span> of atomic devices? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the matter of communicating to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> the views of the Australian Government on nuclear testing, my understanding is that this has been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was gracious enough to admit later that in fact I had protested and that the Prime Minister had raised this matter with the Chinese when he was on the first visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> while Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that in the last few weeks the Australian Government has sent to the Chinese Government its protest against <span class="highlight">China</span>’s nuclear testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In addressing a question to the Minister for the Media, I wish to return to the subject of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier today, the Minister told us of the great privileges bestowed by the bountiful goodness of Peking <span class="highlight">China</span> to permit an Australian Broadcasting Commission cameraman and a newsman to stay in that country for a given period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> has recommended to the Australian Depart ment of . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The best that can be hoped for is that the proletarian leaders are more concerned with the welfare of their own countries than with being a vassal state of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or <span class="highlight">China</span> in an expansive mood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Government believes that our close relations with the United States, our growing partnership with Japan and the speedy and successful normalisation of relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> provide a realistic and fruitful basis for such an Australian initiative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time we were still involved in a war in South Vietnam; we still had Australian troops committed to the area; we had troops in other areas of IndoChina, whether or not the Government of the day admitted it; and we had a great hostility towards the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know of the criticism of the previous Prime Minister when a decision was taken by the then Leader of the Opposition to visit <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that subsequently on the eve of the delivery of this speech the former Prime Minister discovered that the American President also was going on the <span class="highlight">China</span> trail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those things have all changed today and relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> have been normalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have no troops committed in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> and we are in the happy situation where, generally speaking, Australia’s relations are improving continually in the Asian sphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the AttorneyGeneral: Is it not a fact that radioactive fallout from a nuclear explosion in <span class="highlight">China</span> is just as potent to the world’s atmosphere as one in the Pacific? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has it ever been contemplated that representations be made to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> - as they call it - along the grounds 1 have- indicated? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In every conceivable way this Government has shown its support for the communist side in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The list includes the crawl to Red <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Professor Teng case, the Taiwan basketball team case, the Taiwan ping pong team case, the rush to East Germany, the rush to Hanoi, the promise to recognise the Vietcong, and so on ad infinitum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I received the credentials of the delegate from the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, I was acting on behalf of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government of the United States went to aid that country against the onslaught of the communists who were assisted by Red <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why do they not get it from Red <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia, which are their allies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we make a comparison between John Foster Dulles and the statesmanlike attitude of Prime Minister Attlee of Great Britain, Prime Minister Chifley of Australia, Australia’s Minister for Foreign Affairs,  Dr Evatt,  and Peter Fraser of New Zealand and if we consider the relatively bloodless development of India, Pakistan and even Ceylon and the internal conflict in Indonesia, we recognise that none of those struggles was prolonged in any way, as was the struggle in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A courageous Australian government in the 1950s might have suggested to the then French government that if some degree of flexibility in its foreign policy had been allowed there would have been a normal ushering-in of nationhood in IndoChina, as we know it now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that particularly to the Country Party members who, because of their problems in relation to the sale of wheat, tried to take a one-eyed attitude about relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now we find that our friends are Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, North Vietnam, Communist Yugoslavia and a host of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators opposite are prepared to cast their minds back and be honest about this, they will concede that in the 1939-45 World War, when it was a question of defending Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, the then colonialists in IndoChina, particularly in Vietnam - it was then one nation - were collaborators with the people against whom we lost more than 27,000 men from this country alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The French and the Dutch endeavoured to impose their colonial rule, in the first instance in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> and in the second instance in Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then the French decided that they had a rightful claim to the part of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> about which we are talking this evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other parts of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> had been cut up between the great colonial powers, including the old United Kingdom, the great empire of yesteryear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The French were so bankrupt that they could not sustain their attempts to reassert their colonial influence in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unbeknown to the then  President  of the United States of America and by some devious means, the American nation started to support the re-establishment of colonial rule in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we had really wanted a bulwark against the threat of the so-called downward thrust of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the aid of the 2 great communist empires of the world - <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia - the North Vietnamese Government exerted bloodshed, atrocity indescribable and massacre on the South Vietnamese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is that same purblind outlook that has induced the Government, presided over by  Mr Whitlam  but not controlled by him, firstly to accept recognition by Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> on condition that we jettison Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What figures are available from both Russia and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> on current stock piles of feed and fibre and projections of current cropping results? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister think, in view of the military situation in Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span>, that either Russia or <span class="highlight">China</span> is likely to disclose any reliable figures on current agricultural stockpiles or production? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not so sure of the position in the case of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has he any figures available from any source on the feed and fibre stocks in the Communist bloc countries as a whole, not only of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the reference in the National Radiation Advisory Committee report which stresses that nuclear tests in either the northern or southern hemisphere could harm Australia, I ask: Has the Government been provided with any information from official sources in <span class="highlight">China</span> with respect to the degree and measurement of fallout resulting from Chinese nuclear explosions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to my earlier question to him about his attendance at a reception to the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese last night and his response that my allegation that North Vietnam was waging aggressive war in Indo <span class="highlight">China</span> was purely a personal view - implying to me that he held a contrary view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Special Minister of State inform the Senate of the Opposition senators who will visit <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as representatives of the Australian Parliament at a later date this year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister Assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs been drawn to a radio news item attributed to the Australian Ambassador to <span class="highlight">China</span> in which he was reported to have said that he did not think a continuance of nuclear tests by that country would interfere with the improved relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 do not understand  Senator Jessop’s  comparison between France and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the attitude we will take with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If in our protest to <span class="highlight">China</span> and, indeed, to any other country that is exploding nuclear devices in the atmosphere, we can get our point over and have some influence without harming relationships, that is precisely what we will be doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of preface I indicate that I heard on radio today that  Dr Fitzgerald  had commented that an approach had been made by the Labor Government to the Peoples Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in relation to its testing of nuclear devices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now ask: Will the Government advise the Government of the Peoples Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> that this Government will support the unions in this country in their threat to halt all communications and trade relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> unless she immediately stops nuclear testing in the atmosphere? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government advise <span class="highlight">China</span>, as a Minister of this Government advised France, that it will consider breaking diplomatic relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> unless it halts nuclear testing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the other matter concerning diplomatic relations, whether such relations be with <span class="highlight">China</span> or with any other country, this is a matter for consideration by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I set out to show Japan’s unique situation, born of history, isolation, a geography that makes the Japanese islands off-shore islands in conjunction with Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span>, and a post-war growth which puts Japan today third in the industrial world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The importance to Japan not only of a country that has immense natural resources - because both Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span> may well have similar resources - but also of a country that is politically stable and capable of honouring contracts and delivering resources of a specific grade and volume at a particular time transcends other things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who look to Japan turning to <span class="highlight">China</span>, Russia, other parts of Asia or other parts of the world should keep in mind that Australia’s ability to provide high quality resources to Japan is of vital importance to Japan just as Japan’s business is to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Japan was unique and that it was uniquely situated in geography alongside Russia, close to <span class="highlight">China</span>, with America across the Pacific and with Western Europe growing up to the west. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 say this without suggesting any power groupings of the world, just so long as Western Europe and America work together in keeping peace in the world and Japan looks towards a parallel philosophy developed by those two countries whilst recognising that she has as neighbours Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that very often in the past this country has had to enter into agreements with countries which were not in a position to pay on the more favourable terms that we know apply to <span class="highlight">China</span> where payments are effected in 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because <span class="highlight">China</span> is such a meagre unit in terms of world trade, ranking a little higher than Taiwan - which is, of course, a very much smaller country - on this ground alone can the cost of  Dr Cairns’s  visit to that country be justified at all; or, so far as accruing more trade for Australia is concerned, can the cost of extra officials covering the inauguration of the new Australian Ambassador to <span class="highlight">China</span> be justified? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In vie-w of the Minister’s advice to me yesterday that  Senator Greenwood,  Liberal, Victoria has been nominated for the delegation to <span class="highlight">China</span> and  Senator Maunsell.,  Country Party, Queensland, for the delegation to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, as Opposition representatives of the Australian Parliament <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But on this whole question, when the trips were first mooted I had talks with the Ambassador of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and also with the Charge d’ Affairs of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government then anticipated that there would be complaints from the representatives of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does not his reply to my earlier question indicate subservience to the arrogant demands of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was a part of the agreement with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> that was made clear in the Senate in answer to several questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Mr Li  was coming in an unofficial capacity, is it not a reasonable deduction that the Australian Government was prepared to allow  Mr Li  to attend the meeting until it received a complaint from the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What other countries have made a similar agreement with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> - an agreement, apparently, which enables the People’s Republic virtually to veto the entry of Taiwanese into Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of that we anticipated, as I said yesterday, that there would be a complaint because of the arrangements we had made with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as I know, these sorts of arrangements have been made with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> by most of the countries of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he does not intend to do so, is it because the Chinese explosion is different from the French explosion and will not affect the atmosphere or because the Australian Government is fearful of offending <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yes, we did make a protest shortly after we set up an embassy in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> accepted the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, should the statement referred to by  Senator Carrick  that <span class="highlight">China</span> intends proceeding with a nuclear testing program prove to be correct, will the Australian Government take this matter to the International Court of Justice with the object of preventing these tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Prime Minister able to confirm that Australia is not ‘discernibly affected by nuclear tests by <span class="highlight">China</span>’, which claim was made by him in a statement of 13th March 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the statement mean that the Australian atmosphere is not, and has not been, measurably affected by fall-out from nuclear tests conducted by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The explosion of high fission yield devices by <span class="highlight">China</span> injects this radioactive matter into the northern half of the stratosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the present trade mission to <span class="highlight">China</span> being headed by the Minister for Overseas Trade and Secondary Industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the, total trade and communications bans imposed on France by the Australian Council of Trade Unions because of the proposed nuclear tests in the Pacific, does the Minister expect that the trade unions will impose similar bans when a further nuclear test date is announced by <span class="highlight">China</span>, which is reported to be currently negotiating new trade agreements with Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The area of concern is more important than is the question of what <span class="highlight">China</span> might do in the foreseeable future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As it has been suggested that the marketing of exports of primary products would be handled in future by the Department of Overseas Trade rather than by individual producer organisations, and bearing in mind that there is at present a world shortage of many of these products, will the Minister give an assurance that traditional lucrative markets built up over the years will not be undermined by  Dr Cairns  in his enthusiasm to negotiate sales of our products to <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The development of trade between Australia and overseas markets is primarily the responsibility of  Dr Cairns,  and although I am basing this .only on Press reports of  Dr Cairns’  efforts in <span class="highlight">China</span>, I would say they have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which relates to the intention of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and of France to continue atmospheric nuclear testing, is directed to the Minister assisting the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: How does the Government reconcile the blatant double standards under which the Minister for Trade,  Dr J.  F. Cairns, is currently actively seeking maximum expansion of trade between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span> while at the same time, the same  Dr J.  F. Cairns and other Government Ministers and members, together with the Australian Council nf Trade Unions, are working to impose a ban on Australian trade with France? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the Government’s policy with regard to trade and sanctions as to France and <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The long and involved question asked by the honourable senator concerns trade and arises out of the nuclear tests being conducted at the moment, mainly by France but possibly in the future by <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the country happens to be <span class="highlight">China</span> I know does upset some honourable senators opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have exchanged diplomatic representatives with <span class="highlight">China</span>, and the sending of a trade mission to <span class="highlight">China</span> is a normal flow-on from that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Our policy further states that when countries such as the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span> refuse to take action to end nuclear armaments in the world Australia then has no alternative but to endeavour to obtain a nuclear deterrent for herself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was the Minister for Overseas Trade,  Dr Cairns,  indicating Labor Government policy in his reported statement to the effect that <span class="highlight">China</span> as a world power had justification for having a nuclear deterrent weapons system but that France was only pursuing Gaullist ambitions in seeking to do so? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that the Australian Wool Corporation has sold approximately 1,000 bales of wool to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industry, refers to a previous question asked regarding the reported sale of wool to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Australian Wool Corporation made the sale to the wool mission from the <span class="highlight">China</span> National Textile Import and Export Corporation without any interference from this Government and in accordance with the customary commercial arrangements of traders in wool. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the nature of the questions being asked by Opposition senators relating to the recent sale of 1,000 bales of wool to <span class="highlight">China</span> by the Australian Wool Corporation, has the Minister received any objections to this sale from wool growers or their organisations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was one man whose position gave him unique power to achieve these changes and I here gratefully acknowledge - as everybody with the welfare of the world at heart must - the pivotal role played by  President  Nixon in ushering in a new and saner phase in our relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>; in clearing the way for more intensive commercial, scientific, technical and cultural exchanges between the United States and’ the Soviet Union, and thereby achieving a successful first round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and in ending foreign intervention in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>None of these great objectives - sensible relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>, the limitation of nuclear weapons and the end of foreign intervention in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> - have yet been brought to ultimate fruition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The most glaring distortion in our pattern of overseas representation was <span class="highlight">China</span>, which ignorance, prejudice and Cold War hostility had excluded for a generation from its rightful place as a member of the international community of nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As soon as we took office, we initiated the process towards recognising the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> - in essence, towards removing our <span class="highlight">China</span> Embassy from Taipei to Peking, the capital of <span class="highlight">China</span> of which Taiwan is a province. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 22 December 1972 I was able to announce that the negotiations had been successfully concluded, that Australia had recognised the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> as the sole legal government of <span class="highlight">China</span>, and that diplomatic relations would be established at an early date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The answer to the honourable senator’s first question is that the primary purpose of  Dr Cairns’s  visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> was trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable senator were to read the documents which have been circulated he would find that the approach to the Court in respect of the Republic of France was based on a treaty called the General Act which is not applicable as between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means there is a clear legal distinction between the position of Australia and France and that of Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the possibility of atmospheric testing by <span class="highlight">China</span> I inform the Senate that Australia has made quite clear to <span class="highlight">China</span> its objections to atmospheric testing by it or any other nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator asks whether atmospheric testing or any further atmospheric testing by <span class="highlight">China</span> will affect the people of the world, including those in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, refers to the report by  Dr Cairns  on his return from Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> that he had raised the matter of tests with  Mr Chou  En-lai. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Chou  En-lai exhibited considerable resentment and said that <span class="highlight">China</span> would continue to conduct atomic tests in the same way as previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Australian Government took the lead in mobilising international opinion against the French test’s, why does not the Australian Government take a similar lead in mobilising international opinion, particularly in South East Asia and the Pacific, against the Chinese tests and drop proposals at present in train for cultural exchanges, visits of parliamentarians and trade advantages for Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to a previous question touching on this matter I indicated that the position of Australia in relation to France is slightly different - in fact it is considerably different - from that which it has in relation to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I indicated that there is such a clear difference that the General Act is not available in relation to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ultimately it is clear that the continuence of atmospheric nuclear testing by nations of the world, including France and <span class="highlight">China</span>, will affect the people of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some will go to <span class="highlight">China</span> next week, I believe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will not be detained here next week if I can help it while others are travelling to <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia at the expense of the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Everybody knows that he is going to <span class="highlight">China</span> next week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been regaled with stories in the Press that the Minister for Overseas Trade,  Dr Cairns,  has been wandering around <span class="highlight">China</span> making a large number of foreign affairs statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It occurs to me that, instead of chasing the myth of the <span class="highlight">China</span> market, as has been explained so splendidly by Professor Heinz Arndt, the former economic adviser to the Labor Party, the Minister for Overseas Trade would be far better occupied if he directed his attention to what is probably a far more lucrative market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I address my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and remind him that the Prime Minister and  Senator Willesee  have repeatedly asserted that the formula used in assuming diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> was similar to the formula adopted by other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned last night,  Dr J.  F. Cairns has been tripping around <span class="highlight">China</span> making various statements on foreign affairs and periodically referring to trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The value of such relief to the Australian wool producer would be infinitely greater than all the wool in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that Tanzania is a oneparty fascist type state, despite its close subservience to Red <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that Tanzania’s air force, such as it is, is being trained by Red <span class="highlight">China</span> near Peking? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation - conceived as an instrument for the containment of <span class="highlight">China</span> in the cold war era - must be modified if it is not to become completely moribund.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When was the protest of the Australian Government made to the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> concerning that country’s nuclear tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has there been any response by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, or any attempt by the Australian Government to secure a response. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since it is possible that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> might explode a nuclear device at any time, is the matter not equally as urgent as the French tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister is on record (Hansard 12 April) as having said that the Government believes that France and <span class="highlight">China</span> should both accede to the Limited Test Ban Treaty; and that we have protested to the Chinese Government against its failure to accede to this treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike France, <span class="highlight">China</span> has not made a declaration of acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction pursuant to Article 36 (2) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike France, <span class="highlight">China</span> is not a party to the General Act for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes, 1928. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, while Australia can unilaterally require France to appear before the Court, it cannot so require <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What were the terms of the Australian protest to <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister agree with the statement made in Ottawa by the Prime Minister in which he seemed to excuse <span class="highlight">China</span> for conducting nuclear tests but said that the French action was monstrous? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not a fact that whatever verbal protest the Government may have made to <span class="highlight">China</span> it is entirely different from the positive hostile action taken ‘against France? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an inconsistent attitude if, as  Senator Willesee  would have the people of Australia believe, the Government’s attitude to nuclear testing is the same irrespective of whether it is carried out by France or <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They now toddle across to <span class="highlight">China</span> and say all is very well, and they apparently recognise the error of their ways and their failed foreign policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Australian Labor Party and  Mr Whitlam  have over the years made the strongest statements against the conduct of such tests by any nation, including the Chinese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not impose any bans, we do not seek censure from the world, because we have decided that <span class="highlight">China</span> shall have special recognition from us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Have the Prime Minister and the Special Minister of State repeatedly asserted that the formula establishing diplomatic relations between this country and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is similar to the formula adopted by other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Have sports, cultural and other exchanges, as well as air services, between Japan and Taiwan continued much as before, and the level of trade increased significantly between these countries, since Japan recognised the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Australian formula recognising the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> permit the same type of relationship with Taiwan as those of Japan, Canada and other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia’s position on residual private contacts with Taiwan is similar to that of Canada and other countries in diplomatic relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that  Dr Cairns  on behalf of the Government recently signed a trade agreement accompanied by expressions of eternal friendship with <span class="highlight">China</span> - a country which recently exploded a nuclear bomb which affected 7 times more people than the French nuclear tests did? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Government regard the different attitudes it adopts to trade with France and <span class="highlight">China</span> as indicating a double standard? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> for its part has effected some rapprochment with both the United States and Japan, and has strong interests in the avoidance of major international conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Representatives of our Government went to Peking and there announced that it would recognise the Peking Government and declared that it would not recognise the Taiwan Government on the ground that it  was  a part of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was said by our Government that in <span class="highlight">China</span> it is claimed that <span class="highlight">China</span> is one country and that therefore we could not recognise both. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the time came to do so we did not say, as we had said in <span class="highlight">China</span>, that one cannot recognise both. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indonesia has to reflect upon the fact that if it recognises Peking <span class="highlight">China</span> it could find that that country will bring to Indonesia a couple of hundred alleged diplomats who would really be organisers of a communist revolution in Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These countries have a lot of problems, and they have not been helped by the manner in which we rushed in headlong to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span> when they at least had the right to expect us to consult them and talk it over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Leader of the Government in the Senate offer any explanation as to the contention of the Prime Minister in a recent statement to the effect that French nuclear explosions in the Pacific were a monstrous proposition; also that <span class="highlight">China</span> was in danger of attack, and France was not? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Were these contentions used merely to cover up the strangely ambiguous attitude by which a threat was made to sever diplomatic relations with France but <span class="highlight">China</span>, which persists in exploding nuclear bombs in proximity to the world’s greatest centre of population, is treated by the Government with honour, its emissaries are received in this country and trade agreements are entered into with them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We accept the fact that the Government - maybe reluctantly; maybe more in sorrow than in anger - has protested to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has never condemned <span class="highlight">China</span> in the same form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has taken no action against <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that no member of the Government either in this House or in the other place has ever asked a question which is critical of <span class="highlight">China</span> in regard to atmospheric nuclear testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the questions in regard to <span class="highlight">China</span> have come from the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Prime Minister was excusing himself for not taking action against <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then the Prime Minister was asked about the form of protest made to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The protest to <span class="highlight">China</span> was oral, so there would be no written response. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government advise the Government of the Peoples Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> that this Government will support the unions in this country in their threat to halt all communications and trade relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> unless she immediately stops nuclear testing in the atmosphere? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government advise <span class="highlight">China</span>, as a Minister of this Government advised France, that it will consider breaking diplomatic relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> unless it halts nuclear testing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in the interests of humanity - of all the people of the world, whether they live in the south west Pacific region or whether they live in Japan, Korea or indeed in the Peoples Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some little time ago  Dr Cairns  led a trade delegation to <span class="highlight">China</span> and he said that he protested to Chou En-lai concerning the Chinese tests, but Chou <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>En-lai become somewhat angry and replied very angrily to  Dr Cairns  and made it quite clear that <span class="highlight">China</span> was going to continue nuclear testing whether we liked it or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But  Dr Cairns,  when he was in <span class="highlight">China</span>, invited the Chinese Minister of Trade to come to Australia to conclude a trade agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very interesting to note that despite the ban on French trade there was no protest from  Mr Hawke  and the trade unions about the visit of the Chinese Trade Minister and the conclusion of a trade agreement with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shortly afterwards he sold his soul to <span class="highlight">China</span> for trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is noteworthy also that at one stage  Dr Cairns,  apparently in a more frank moment, said that he would support a ban on trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> if it exploded a nuclear weapon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, <span class="highlight">China</span> exploded one and  Dr Cairns  has been silent ever since. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, when we asked about <span class="highlight">China</span> we were told that because <span class="highlight">China</span> does not recognise the International Court of Justice there is no legal basis for taking <span class="highlight">China</span> before that Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But does that excuse the Government from taking action against <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does that excuse the Government for not imposing a trade ban against <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are plenty of other actions open to the Government to show and move its condemnation of Chinese atmospheric tests, instead of hiding in a cowardly manner behind some legal quibble that <span class="highlight">China</span> does not recognise the International Court of Justice and that therefore we should sit down, wring our hands and say we can do nothing more about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report started off by saying that  Mr Whitlam  had said that France’s nuclear test program was more monstrous than <span class="highlight">China</span>’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether we have degrees of monstrosity, but he said it was more monstrous than <span class="highlight">China</span>’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I tried to get an answer from the Government on whether the Chinese regarded the fallout danger as being insignificant or whether <span class="highlight">China</span> showed a callous disregard for the welfare and health of its people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has there been any suggestion by the Government that it would recall our Ambassador from <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam  went on to say that he agreed that his criticisms of the French program were in sterner language - that is tougher talk - than his response to <span class="highlight">China</span>’s atmospheric tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said he considered <span class="highlight">China</span> was under threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe <span class="highlight">China</span> is under threat and perhaps the Chinese consider themselves to be under threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is not only the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> that is affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time our Ambassador to the Peoples Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> sat comfortably in Peking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What logic or rationality can there be for one Ambassador to remain in Australia in protest and the other to remain in <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can assume only that the Government has no intention of going beyond making some mild protest to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find that the Government is placing its complete reliance upon its supposed detente, its supposed better relations, with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is almost an absurd proposition that because we recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> and <span class="highlight">China</span>’s attitude to Australia will become friendly when previously it was hostile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In November 1938, after the Munich Pact and as Germany stood poised to launch herself against the world and the Japanese were in the process of subduing <span class="highlight">China</span>, the leader of the Labor Party, the late  Mr Curtin,  told this Parliament that so far as Australia was concerned, any increase in defence expediture was ‘an utterly unjustifiable and hysterical piece of panic propaganda’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What other countries previously recognising Taiwan but now having diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> have placed restrictions on travel to Taiwan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Prime Minister explain why the Government permits a full-scale trade boycott of France for exploding a clean bomb and at the same time enters into a most favoured nation trade agreement with <span class="highlight">China</span>, presumably for exploding a dirty one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the Government is concerned, official trade relations with France and <span class="highlight">China</span> continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>19 relates to the motion moved last Thursday night by  Senator Sim  concerning atmospheric nuclear tests by <span class="highlight">China</span> and France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to such things as relieving conscripts of their obligation to go to Vietnam, the withdrawal from Vietnam and the recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate deplores the Government’s double standards in respect of atmospheric nuclear testing by <span class="highlight">China</span> and France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether <span class="highlight">China</span> is testing nuclear weapons or France is testing nuclear weapons is only a superficial argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my mind the double standards of the Government in respect of atmospheric nuclear testing by <span class="highlight">China</span> and France are indicative of its standards in everything it does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator O  ‘Byrne did not mention one word about <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who listened to  Senator O  ‘Byrne’s speech would know that he does not even realise that <span class="highlight">China</span> has exploded atmospheric nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government and the trade unions were organising trade bans against the French while the Minister for Overseas Trade,  Dr Cairns,  was racing over to <span class="highlight">China</span> and negotiating special, favoured treatment in trade relations with that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was doing this despite the fact that both <span class="highlight">China</span> and France were carrying out atmospheric nuclear testing at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To come back to the terms of the motion before the Senate, it states that the Senate deplores the fact that the Government has not been prepared to protest to <span class="highlight">China</span> in the manner it has protested to France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is evidence of the same type of action being taken against <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not say who was threatening to attack <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not say who was threatening <span class="highlight">China</span> but we know he was referring to Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can imagine that if <span class="highlight">China</span> is under threat of attack and that threat is posed by Russia, the whole of the world will be involved in any conflict which might ensue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does it matter whether a test is carried out on a Pacific island or in <span class="highlight">China</span>, in the southern hemisphere or in the northern hemisphere, whether it is close to Australia or whether it is not? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that this Government is prepared to do everything possible to frustrate France while at the same time it does absolutely nothing to oppose nuclear testing by <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Atmospheric Nuclear Tests by <span class="highlight">China</span> and France: Adjourned debate … on the motion by  Senator Sim-  that the Senate deplores the Government’s double standards in respect of atmospheric nuclear testing by <span class="highlight">China</span> and France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time <span class="highlight">China</span> was exploding such devices but the Government did not make a murmur about that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did not enter any protest against <span class="highlight">China</span> because it was not playing speaks with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only time the previous Government played speaks with <span class="highlight">China</span> was when it was able to sell tallow, wheat and iron ore through various back door countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the moment India, on her border, has 2 powerful neighbours with nuclear arms- the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I also agree with the suggestion implicit in the motion, that is, that they could have and should have shown much greater indignation over the explosions which have been carried out by <span class="highlight">China</span> in the past and which are going to be carried out by <span class="highlight">China</span> in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now turn to the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This motion is based on a statement that there is selective indignation and that the indignation against France is infinitely greater than any form of indignation suggested by this Government in regard to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been told by  Dr J.  F. Cairns and others who have been to <span class="highlight">China</span> that  Mr Chou  En-lai, the Foreign Minister of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, informed them that the Chinese personally supported the attitude of the French in carrying out these tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Premier Chou En-lai said that he believed that France, like <span class="highlight">China</span>, had to have nuclear armaments because of the threat from the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also said that <span class="highlight">China</span> would continue to conduct these nuclear tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have expected that when Australia was so strong in its protest to France it would have been similarly strong in its protest to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we went to the International Court to determine the legal arguments in regard to France, I think that we ought to have tried to determine the legal arguments in regard to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I merely ask any fair-minded senator: Do you consider that it is an argument against Australia’s taking action against <span class="highlight">China</span> that the winds will blow the nuclear fallout over Asian people and not over Australian people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me read again the answer he gave in regard to why he would not take action against <span class="highlight">China</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Doesn’t the same argument apply to <span class="highlight">China</span>, that other countries are being affected by fallout? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has happened in regard to <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government says that it does not think that it can get to the World Court in relation to <span class="highlight">China</span> at least it could show its disapproval. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Overseas Trade  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  went to <span class="highlight">China</span> at a time when <span class="highlight">China</span> was exploding atomic bombs which threatened the welfare of people all around it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dr Cairns  went to Peking and signed a treaty which declared that in the eyes of the Australian Government <span class="highlight">China</span> was the most favoured nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the indignation that is lavished on France is not lavished on <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the proper attitude for the Labor Government to adopt would be to say that it will break off its present relations, particularly from a trade point of view, with <span class="highlight">China</span> until <span class="highlight">China</span> promises to cease atomic testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that the reason why  Mr Whitlam  asked the ACTU to cease its action against the French was that a number of unions had placed on the agenda of the ACTU congress motions seeking similar condemnatory action to be taken in regard to <span class="highlight">China</span>, because of its tests, as had been taken against France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the reason why it was lifted was that certain unions had put an item on the agenda for the ACTU conference asking that <span class="highlight">China</span> be similarly condemned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our Government, which at present is making trade treaties with <span class="highlight">China</span>, which calls <span class="highlight">China</span> the most favoured nation and which will set up a high priority visit by our Prime Minister and other Ministers to <span class="highlight">China</span>, felt it was very embarrassing that certain trade unions said that they ought to be honest enough to do to <span class="highlight">China</span> what they were doing to France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> ought to be a most favoured nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to see Australia being just as tough in regard to <span class="highlight">China</span> as it is in regard to France or Rhodesia or South Africa, and just as tough in regard to what is happening in Czechoslovakia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has removed the ban simply because it looks a bit awkward when the Australian unions are wanting <span class="highlight">China</span> to be attacked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this present equation the United Kingdom and the United States are superimposed on the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is inevitable, even disregarding ideological reasons, that there be a conflict of interest between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will deal in a moment with criticism that honourable senators opposite advance against <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for <span class="highlight">China</span>, I do not know what honourable senators on the Opposition side wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been critical of France and we have been critical of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are prepared to be a bit tolerant and say that he achieved some understanding with the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span> and that there has been a reduction of tension in South Vietnam, although there are a few other odd things still happening in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate deplores the Government’s double standards in respect of atmospheric nuclear testing by <span class="highlight">China</span> and France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The test is simply this: Is the Government handing out even handed treatment and justice to France and to <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both <span class="highlight">China</span> and France in recent weeks and months have exploded nuclear devices in the atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Attorney-General go to <span class="highlight">China</span> at all for any reason? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did any Government Minister- the Foreign Minister or the Prime Minister- go to <span class="highlight">China</span> directly for the reason of protesting against the Chinese tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did he seek to go to <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The protest was directed against France but not against <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What did the Government do in relation to <span class="highlight">China</span> in terms of trade and communications? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not adopting a double standard that the Government permits a ban against France and encourages an expansion of trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>France and ignore <span class="highlight">China</span> in protesting about nuclear testing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was prepared to go along with a protest against France and <span class="highlight">China</span> but not just against France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So off the Prime Minister went to Ottawa to try to drum up support for a protest against France but not against <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we the Opposition asked: ‘Why do you not protest against <span class="highlight">China</span>’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister came out with this famous statement: ‘Well, of course <span class="highlight">China</span> does not concern us because it is situated thousands of miles away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By what percentages has the present radiation level been contributed to by past nuclear testing by (a) the United Kingdom, (b) the United States of America, (c) the Union Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, (d) The People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, and (e) France? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked the Attorney-General- and the Minister for Primary Industry  (Senator Wriedt)  who is sitting at the table will remember this- long before the tests in France or <span class="highlight">China</span> occurred this question: ‘Where will the Chinese tests occur?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ultimately I was told: ‘We do not quite know, but we think it might be Lop Nor in the Sinkiang Province in the north west of <span class="highlight">China</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Minister in his reply will tell us whether he thinks that <span class="highlight">China</span> has a greater right to build a bomb; whether, in the Prime Minister’s words, <span class="highlight">China</span> is under a greater threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that here is a Prime Minister who says that there is justification and who understands that the justification in <span class="highlight">China</span>’s mind for building a nuclear deterrent because <span class="highlight">China</span> is under a real threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With one standard he said yes, he could understand <span class="highlight">China</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Does Senator Keeffe agree that it is right for <span class="highlight">China</span> to build a bomb but wrong for France? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reply to my question whether the Government had asked <span class="highlight">China</span> when it was likely to explode bombs he answered: ‘No, we have not done anything of the sort ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second standard is that we drum up world opinion unsuccessfully stage by stage to try to attack France but not <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We sent our Minister abroad to attack France, but we sent no one on a mission to <span class="highlight">china</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government supported the banning of trade and communications with France but welcomed with open arms trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is this Government’s policy why is it that we did not recall our ambassador from <span class="highlight">China</span> and have him sit in Australia putting on a petulant sulk for some weeks as well so that we could have the same standard for <span class="highlight">China</span> as we have had for France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was when he reached Washington that he began to show rather more promise: He needed to, of course, because he was starting with the handicap of strained relations caused by his senior ministers ‘ criticisms of American activities in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> at the beginning of the year and his own somewhat truculent attitude towards the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said, in the mien of a man who is uncovering some awful sacrilege, that the Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Snedden,  had poured sand into the diplomatic relations that exist between this country and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs some time ago made a speech in which he referred to Taiwan as a province of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at that record it is difficult to believe that anyone could think that Taiwan is naturally a province of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout the world continuing comprehensive reports were required by all sections of the media on the brisk moves of the new Labor Government; for instance, the abolition of national service, revaluation of the dollar, recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, the establishment of diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic and North Vietnam, Australia’s stand on the French nuclear testing in the Pacific, the subsequent finding by the International Court of Justice and the effects of Britain’s entry into the European Economic Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The situation is that we do not consider the Taiwan Government as the Government of <span class="highlight">China</span>; that is quite clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We regard Peking as the capital of <span class="highlight">China</span>, not Taipei. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was, of course, the very urgent matter that had been going on for years of the recognition of Red <span class="highlight">China</span> and East Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate deplores the Government’s double standards in respect of atmospheric nuclear testing by <span class="highlight">China</span> and France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out that the nature of the message transmitted to each of the countries, <span class="highlight">China</span> and France, was different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that <span class="highlight">China</span> and France both exploded nuclear devices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No Minister was sent to <span class="highlight">China</span> to do the same thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, we had the question of a trade pact with <span class="highlight">China</span>, on the one hand giving her most favoured nation treatment and, on the other hand, urging, on the part of  Dr Cairns  and others and certainly supported by the Government, a ban on trade and communications with the French. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam agreed that his criticisms of the French program were in sterner language than his response to <span class="highlight">China</span>’s atmospheric tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said he considered <span class="highlight">China</span> was under threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said he considered <span class="highlight">China</span> was under threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the halls of nations our Prime Minister has gone on record as saying that <span class="highlight">China</span> is under threat, and by that there can be only one meaning: He is saying that <span class="highlight">China</span> is under threat from Soviet Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He sees no great harm in the Chinese exploding a device over the land at Lop Nor in the Sinkiang Province in north-western <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is I think of some significance that perhaps the greatest of our nuclear scientists in Australia, Professor  Sir Ernest  Titterton, is on record as saying that if we are to rap anybody we should rap <span class="highlight">China</span> because in his words the effect of the Chinese bomb is exposed immediately to 7 times more people in terms of world population than that of the French. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But an article which appeared in the Melbourne ‘Herald’ under the heading: ‘We Get the <span class="highlight">China</span> Bomb Fallout Says Scientist’ states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Short-lived radiation from the tests at Lop Nor in western <span class="highlight">China</span> did not reach Australia’, he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said Australia’s and New Zealand’s approach to tests by <span class="highlight">China</span> in contrast to those by France illustrated this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot receive representatives of <span class="highlight">China</span> or any other country so long as they continue to test nuclear weapons anywhere in the world’ . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My difficulty is that if I am not prepared to receive representatives of the French Government, what must my position be when it comes to my friends in <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate deplores the Government’s double standards in respect of atmospheric nuclear testing by <span class="highlight">China</span> and France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the most noteworthy fact is that from the Government side not one of the 3 speakers condemned the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> specifically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not one of you mentioned one word of condemnation of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator referred to it in general terms, but there was not one word that was specifically in condemnation of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was not one word of condemnation specifically of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I challenge him to point out where he specifically condemned <span class="highlight">China</span> in a manner equal to his condemnation of France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> was mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators opposite by their failure to condemn <span class="highlight">China</span> have condemned themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Australian Prime Minister,  Mr Whitlam,  said today that France’s nuclear testing program was more monstrous than <span class="highlight">China</span>’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if we were to look at degrees of what is more monstrous, then I suppose one could argue that the tests of <span class="highlight">China</span> are more monstrous than those of France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> is exploding a dirtier bomb that affects more people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators of  Dr J.  F. Cairns visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> when he said he took up with Chou En-lai the question of Chinese nuclear tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">China</span> is under threat, it is under threat from one country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">China</span> is under threat no stable world situation will develop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that this Government reversed the policy of the previous Government in regard to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such criteria will be applied in the case of regular scheduled services to <span class="highlight">China</span> after full consultation in the normal way with Qantas, whose views have been, and will continue to be, given full weight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 understand that a number of countries which recognise the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> have placed comparable restrictions on official travel to Taiwan and on the use of official or diplomatic passports for travel to Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-5">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is going among the old <span class="highlight">china</span> while he visits the new <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to that war, between Australia and Asia and the rest of the world we had the British in India and in Malaya, the Dutch in Indonesia, the French in IndoChina and the Americans in the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A year or two after that war an event happened as a result of which nothing could ever again be the same for the security of our country- communism took over <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and <span class="highlight">China</span> face one another across their common border where the Russians have 45 divisions and the Chinese have almost as many. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A diplomat from one of those countries told me that other day that his country has not yet recognised communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that his country sent one of its top diplomats to see Chou En-lai and told him that the position between their 2 countries would be much easier if <span class="highlight">China</span> did not interfere in the internal affairs of this small South East Asian country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that with the serious position to the north of Australia the increasing power of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union and the big increases in the size of their navies, anybody who simply says that we can forget the rest of the world for 10 to 15 years will have a very serious awakening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true also that there has been some measure of understanding reached between the United States of America and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The balance between the United States, <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Soviet Union and Japan- the quadrilateral in our region- is far from clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these things happen how will they affect relations between Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, if Japan cannot reach agreement with the Soviet Union will Japan reach agreement with <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overshadowing all these things is the relationship between Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are reports- I think this was mentioned by  Senator McManus-  that there are between 44 and 49 Russian divisions along the border between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union and that they are faced by an equivalent number of Chinese divisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is reported also that a significant proportion of the Russian nuclear deterrent as well as a significant part of its air power is facing <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I accept the view- I only hope it is true- that it is unlikely that there will be a major conflict between Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that today there is greater fear, in <span class="highlight">China</span> of Russia than there is of <span class="highlight">China</span> in Russia; I believe that the Chinese fear the Russians more than the Russians fear the Chinese in the short term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it may well be that the Russians believe that <span class="highlight">China</span> may well threaten them in future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mention was made of the confrontation between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Chinese feel that there is a threat from the Soviet Union then obviously they will try to match those particular bases and a situation could develop where the confrontation will be not on the border between Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span> but in some remote part of the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He used to flood the electorate with maps of Australia showing red arrows descending from <span class="highlight">China</span> by rather circuitous routes, some going through Malaya, some going through Honolulu, some going up and some coming down, but all of thiem ultimately finishing up at the Royal Perth Golf Club. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer not only to the cold war between the United States, its allies and appendages, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics but to a time when the divisions between the USSR and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> had not become as apparent as they are now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have recognised the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe there can be any doubt that, just as our participation in that war was used by aggressive elements in the United States to justify their position, so our withdrawal from that war had an influence on the United States Government in ending its participation in the war in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are in a position where we can talk to the people in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The dispute between the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span> is a black feature at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it did nothing else, the role that it played in ending the Vietnam war and the role that it played in seeing that sensible relations exist between this country and <span class="highlight">China</span>, Vietnam and East Germany would be abiding memorials to this Government and of permanent benefit to the peace of the world and the security of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has forced both Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span> to change their international policies so that they have sought to make friends with other countries because they fear a major conflict between themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The key to victory for either Russia or <span class="highlight">China</span> in a conflict between those 2 countries would be the economic power of Japan to produce the weapons of war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ‘West Australian’ newspaper comments that if these men came from mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> perhaps the situation would be different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>in another attack on the West, accuses New Zealand and Australia of cowardice for protesting against the French nuclear tests but not against the nuclear tests carried out by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Senate knows I was fortunate to be a member of the representation from this Senate which visited <span class="highlight">China</span> as part of a parliamentary delegation this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Also, after the visit of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  to Japan, where he is to represent the Government as Minister for Foreign Affairs as well as Prime Minister, and his visit to <span class="highlight">China</span>,  Senator Willesee,  who is himself now abroad representing Australia at the United Nations General Assembly and other international meetings, will be sworn as Minister for Foreign Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We also reopened opportunities in <span class="highlight">China</span>, a market which had been cut off to Australian primary producers through sheer political expediency on the part of the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Overseas Trade refers to an extraordinary statement attributed to the Minister for Overseas Trade,  Dr Cairns,  to the effect that the duration of wheat sales contracts to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> will depend upon whether there is a change of government in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: Are we to take it that the present Australian Government accepts the position that trade negotiations with Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> will depend on whether the government in power here is one of which Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai approve? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister for Primary Industry, refers to an answer given recently in the Parliament by the Minister for Overseas Trade,  Dr Cairns,  on the terms of the wheat sale to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not see that that is any cause for concern; in fact, I think it is an indication of the excellent work done by  Dr Cairns  in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite members of the Opposition, and  Senator Carrick  in particular if he wishes to answer, to state categorically that they oppose the wheat agreement that has been entered into with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the extraordinary statement by the Minister for Overseas Trade,  Dr J.  F. Cairns, which appears at page 2056 of the House of Representatives Hansard of yesterday’s date, and which has just been quoted by  Senator Carrick,  that  Mr Pai,  the Minister for Foreign Trade of the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, stated that the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> would sign a wheat agreement for 3 years only in case there was a change of government in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the formula for the recognition of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> contained an undertaking of non-interference in each other’s affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the event that he has not seen it, I draw his attention to a report appearing in the newspaper, the ‘Australian’, today regarding the Prime Minister’s forthcoming visit to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731018_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it also a fact that the bull will be transported to <span class="highlight">China</span> by a Royal Australian Air Force Hercules aircraft at an estimated cost of $20,000? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731018_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Prime Minister on his forthcoming visit to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> raise with the Government of that country the repeated reports that <span class="highlight">China</span> is a significant purchaser of Rhodesian chrome? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Trade Agreement between Australia and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, signed at Canberra on 24 July 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Admittedly it is comparable to the feldshers or the barefoot doctors in <span class="highlight">China</span> but it is not comparable to our system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it true that the commercial television networks Channel 9 and Channel 7 have refused to send news teams to cover the Prime Minister’s trip to Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to say the least I think it disappointing that apparently the Channel 9 network will have no exclusive coverage of an event of such historic importance as the visit of an Australian Prime Minister to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand the situation, the Channel 7 network will have its own coverage of the Prime Minister’s visit to Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be far better for Australian television viewers to see Australian reporters on the spot with the Australian Prime Minister in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the recently announced 3-year agreement for the sale of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The arrangement that has been entered into between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span> is the responsibility of the Minister for Overseas Trade; it is not my responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: Does he know that  Dr Cairns  in another place has claimed that his wheat agreement with Red <span class="highlight">China</span> could only be for 3 years because the Chinese would deal only with a Labor government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this claim is true, how does the Minister explain the enormous sales to <span class="highlight">China</span> by a Liberal-Country Party Government between 1966 and 1970? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If true, does the Government’s obsequious acceptance of such a condition condone a serious interference by <span class="highlight">China</span> in Australia’s internal affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this condition by <span class="highlight">China</span> amount to an external support for the present ailing Government, enable <span class="highlight">China</span> to dictate items of policy and account for some of the extraordinary votes of this Government at the United Nations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I recall a recent ‘Four Corners’ program, 1 think it was, which showed terrorists from Lebanon and elsewhere who had been trained in <span class="highlight">China</span> and who were armed with Chinese weapons to carry out these outrageous acts of terrorism against innocent people throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an obligation on other countries, including <span class="highlight">China</span>, not to cause trouble and not to fish in troubled waters by training and supplying these people, if there is to be peace and trust in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the Minister for Overseas Trade signed an agreement with <span class="highlight">China</span> for Australian wheat sales? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it also a fact that the Australian Wheat Board went to <span class="highlight">China</span> and signed a formal agreement with that country on wheat sales, and that the agreement included a 3-year contract and a specific price for the first 20-odd million bushels of this year’s sale? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, why did the Prime Minister sign another agreement with <span class="highlight">China</span> on wheat sales? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With no nation is our new aspiration symbolised more than it is with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are reports from Peking correct that the Prime Minister has undertaken the task of persuading South East Asian countries which have not recognised communist <span class="highlight">China</span> to recognise that country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer to the second part of the honourable senator’s question as to whether  Mr Whitlam  was going to explain Chinese policy to the rest of South East Asia is that  Mr Whitlam  was very clear that he was not going to be an advocate or an apologist for the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> but that if anybody was to discuss it with him he would make very clear what Australia’s attitude was towards recognition and how we are getting on with the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>direct to the Minister representing the Minister for Northern Development, refers to the reported sale of sugar to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the Prime Minister’s statement in <span class="highlight">China</span> that With no nation is our aspiration symbolised more than it is with <span class="highlight">China</span>’ the considered opinion of the Labor Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As <span class="highlight">China</span> is a communist country, did  Mr Whitlam  mean that Australia is in accord with the communist philosophy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he believes in this silly statement, how does he reconcile the fact that <span class="highlight">China</span> does not have any opposition party and does not have unions or allow strikes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thank the honourable senator for having drawn the attention of the Senate to the extremely successful visit made by the Prime Minister to <span class="highlight">China</span> as well as to other parts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister noticed passing Press reference to the fact that the Prime Minister recently visited mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> in a chartered Qantas Boeing 707 aircraft? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-No doubt the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration has seen reports that following the Prime Minister’s visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> a significant number of Chinese migrants may be coming to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did see a statement in which the Prime Minister said that he would encourage the Chinese Government to give permission for people in <span class="highlight">China</span> to come to Australia to visit and to meet their relatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would not recent agreements made with <span class="highlight">China</span>, Japan, East Germany and other countries indicate that Australian primary producers are assured of long term sales at beneficial rates? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that Australia’s much publicised $250m sugar agreement with the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is considerably enhanced by the fact that it is a long term agreement enabling the Australian industry to plan well in advance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it also a fact that the Minister for Overseas Trade said recently that a new wheat agreement with <span class="highlight">China</span> could be reviewed in the event of a change of government in the next 3 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to make a statement relating to the visit to Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span> by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both visits were marked by great warmth on both sides; both visits were characterised by frankness and firmness from both sides; both visits notably advanced the interests of Australia and our friendship and understanding with these 2 great neighbours, Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the visit to Chinafrom 31 October to 4 November- I was accompanied by the Treasurer and the Minister for Northern Development  (Dr Patterson). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">China</span> I consider that my visit symbolised the successful ending of a generation of lost contact between Australia and the most populous nation on earth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Japan is our major trading partner in the world and <span class="highlight">China</span> is the only one of the world ‘s 5 major powers with which, until last December, we have not had any meaningful or regular official contact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe my visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> was most valuable in restoring balance to our foreign policy and in diversifying our foreign relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the warmth of the reception I and my party received in Peking demonstrates that <span class="highlight">China</span> like Japan recognises, to a greater extent than some Australians may believe, the growing importance of Australia as a middle power, especially in the Asian and Pacific region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators will know, important and valuable arrangements were made for the sale to <span class="highlight">China</span> of up to 300,000 tons of sugar per year for a three to five year period commencing in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was also agreed that we should develop a planned program of cultural, scientific, and technological exchanges between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span>, and that representative missions in these fields would be exchanged in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will be pleased to know that an understanding in principle was reached between the 2 sides on travel from <span class="highlight">China</span> to Australia by relatives of Australian citizens of Chinese descent and Chinese citizens residing in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that my visit will give new direction and increased momentum to our existing relationship with Japan and will lead to the development of a more meaningful relationship and a continuing dialogue with <span class="highlight">China</span> which, for so long- for much too long- has been a closed book to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is entirely proper that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  should table in the Parliament as soon as he can after his return a statement on the outcome of his visit to Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span> and the talks which he held there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We welcomed when in Government those initiatives which  President  Nixon had taken, and we acknowledged also the welcome response of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the ties which subsequently were created. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognise particularly with <span class="highlight">China</span> that there are benefits in creating trade associations and that there is mutuality in the benefits which can be derived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These and other things, I believe, can be positive benefits from the visit to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was, in a way which cannot be said of the visit to <span class="highlight">China</span>, a necessary visit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is little more in this statement on his visit to Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has said he believes his visit ‘will give new direction and increased momentum to our existing relationship with Japan and will lead to the development of a more meaningful relationship and a continuing dialogue with <span class="highlight">China</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If in fact what the Prime Minister did achieve was a relationship with the leaders of Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span> which enables him to contact them more readily and more easily, and to talk on a basis on which his views will be listened to and the views of others will be equally listened to by him so that they know where each other stands, then that is of value, and I do not question that it is of value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Parliament is entitled to something better, a great deal more in the way of information from the Prime Minister as to what actually happened on the visits to Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span>, and what the prospects arising from those visits may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer specifically to the visit to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate will recall that I was a member of a parliamentary delegation which visited <span class="highlight">China</span> for a period of some 14 days this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concern was expressed at what <span class="highlight">China</span> was doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a view that <span class="highlight">China</span> believed it had a right to have a nuclear capability, that <span class="highlight">China</span> was to continue with its nuclear testing until it had that nuclear capability and that while America, Britain and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics had a nuclear capability it was <span class="highlight">China</span>’s right and entitlement to have the same capability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know and I think that the Prime Minister at least ought to say whether that was the attitude which <span class="highlight">China</span> has since adopted, because if <span class="highlight">China</span> has adopted that attitude it is to me surprising that the Prime Minister has adopted a different type of style and approach to that which he has adopted to France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">China</span> has adopted the same attitude as France, and certainly in my experience it is the attitude of the Chinese Government, then one raises the question: Why is it that the Prime Minister is not prepared to speak in the same language to <span class="highlight">China</span> as he is prepared to speak to France? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is equally clear that it is not mentioned in the Prime Minister’s statement that the Prime Minister is prepared to meet with other countries in the Association of South East Asian Nations area and explain to them <span class="highlight">China</span>’s policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The article proceeds to indicate the extent of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s support for these insurgency movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘I think we have to start realising that <span class="highlight">China</span> can never turn its back on these insurgencies,’ a Malaysian Foreign Office official glumly conceded last week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can ‘t really hope that simply by establishing friendly relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> our problems will go away. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I again refer to my experience in <span class="highlight">China</span> with the parliamentary delegation this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were constantly told, as the Prime Minister was told, that <span class="highlight">China</span> seeks to maintain friendly relations with all countries on the basis of the 5 principles of peaceful coexistence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, as we developed further the arguments about the finance for these movements and about the arms which are found and which are made in <span class="highlight">China</span>, the claims I made were conceded point by point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ultimately, we received acknowledgment from the Chinese officials with whom we were travelling that we ought to understand that <span class="highlight">China</span>’s support for insurgency movements or liberation movements was a complete exception to the principles of peaceful co-existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To us it just seems incredible that this position can be maintained as the official stance of the Government; that in a public view through the Foreign Office, <span class="highlight">China</span> can maintain friendly relations with other countries but through the international secretariat which is the foreign branch of the Chinese Communist Party it is seeking to undermine governments in these countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 2 October of this year at the Twenty-eighth United Nations General Assembly the  Chairman  of the Chinese delegation, Chiao Kuan-hua, gave a speech in which he indicated quite clearly the policies to which <span class="highlight">China</span> is committed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are matters which ought to be recognised as some of the factors of which we must take account in our relationships with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister in his speeches in <span class="highlight">China</span> and in the statement which he has made to this Parliament has not adverted in any way to those matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>with unabashed concern … ‘A collapse in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> will bring advanced threat of guerrilla insurgency to our doorsteps by way of Thailand and West Malaysia.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact of life that we cannot blind our eyes to the situation simply by believing that because we have friendly relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> these things can be discarded and forgotten. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same speech to the United Nations in October the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> made it abundantly clear that it supported the Arab nations in what is called ‘their just struggle against Israeli Zionism’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But where does Australia stand in relation to these attitudes to <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if he has the same sort of friendship with <span class="highlight">China</span>, why did he adopt a different stance- if he does adopt a different stance with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first matter I want to refer to concerns the statements which have been made in the Press and on the radio, and not denied, that  Mr Whitlam  had made a commitment to work for the cause of Peking or Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> in South-East Asia with a view to inducing countries in that area to recognise Peking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>South Eastern Asian countries asked him what he thought about things in <span class="highlight">China</span>, he would make favourable comment on any proposal that they should recognise Peking or Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole position is this: In what we have done we have aligned Australia with <span class="highlight">China</span>- make no error about that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other day we aligned ourselves with <span class="highlight">China</span> when, although <span class="highlight">China</span> had exploded and indicated that it would continue to explode atomic bombs, we announced that we had made a treaty with <span class="highlight">China</span> under which <span class="highlight">China</span>, in our eyes, would be the most favoured nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then the Prime Minister announced in his speech that Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> was the one country- he emphasised the point, the one countrywith which Australia would be in tune from now on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was told not so long ago by a prominent South East Asian diplomat that one of the principal persons in the Government of his country visited <span class="highlight">China</span> and saw  Chairman  Mao. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The subject of recognition was raised and this man said to  Chairman  Mao that it would help for better relations if <span class="highlight">China</span> did not interfere in his country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The answer to the second part of the honourable senator’s question as to whether  Mr Whitlam  was going to explain Chinese policy to the rest of South East Asia is that  Mr Whitlam  was very clear that he was not going to be an advocate or an apologist for the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> but that if anybody was to discuss it with him he would make very clear what Australia’s attitude was towards recognition and how we are getting on with the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence only stopped to think they would realise that there is only one country in this area of the world to which we will be looking for support, and that is <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they believe that they should recognise <span class="highlight">China</span> I do not see why the Opposition is making all this fuss about our recognising <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Opposition wishes to fight another election in which it uses the ‘little red arrows’ technique, those arrows should come down not from <span class="highlight">China</span> but from Japan, as that country will come down here again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that our country people will agree that the best things that have ever happened were the trips by the Prime Minister and his party to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am all for a treaty of friendship with <span class="highlight">China</span> because I believe that as it is not for humanity for nations to be friendly with people in their area, we need the help of the Chinese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me assure the Senate that if <span class="highlight">China</span> was recognised by Singapore it would not be long before Singapore was Chinese again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Wheeldon,  I know that you are replying to statements which were made by  Senator McManus,  but I remind you that the Senate is debating a ministerial statement on the visit of the Prime Minister to Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are being told, without any correction, that the same Party which follows the Communist Party of the Soviet Union also follows the Communist Party of <span class="highlight">China</span>- a remarkable feat which even Houdini would have been incapable of performing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be interesting to learn from some of the Opposition speakers who have accused us of being agents of North Vietnamese communists and of being agents of Ho Chi Minh how it is that we are simultaneously his agents and the agents of his Party and the agents of <span class="highlight">China</span> when the Vietnam Workers’ Party still belongs to the Communist and Workers International which the Chinese Communist Party has condemned as a revisionist organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he is an honest broker, not for <span class="highlight">China</span>, as he is reported to have said, but for Australia he should have gone to <span class="highlight">China</span> and said: ‘It is pre-eminently in the interests of the people of this region and the world that South East Asia should be stable; that countries like Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Burma should have the right to separate sovereignty and separate existence and not have the fear that by subversion, by the inducing of liberation fronts, that they can be destroyed; that we as their good neighbours respect their right to co-exist. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs the following question: In view of the genocide practised in Tibet by the Chinese, which was exposed in its report on the matter by the International Commission of Jurists which is based in Geneva, does the Government really believe that Taiwan should be a province of” <span class="highlight">China</span>, it having been referred to as such some time ago by the Prime Minister, because of the risk of a similar fate befalling the people of that country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister is so purblind on <span class="highlight">China</span>- this description of him was given to me by a senior Labor man- that it would not have surprised me if the Prime Minister had brought back from <span class="highlight">China</span> the No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Will the Minister for Foreign Affairs explain in some detail the exact meaning of the expression used by the Prime Minister that ‘Australia’s new aspiration is symbolised more in our relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> than with any other country’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the Prime Minister invited the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to play a more active role in South East Asia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Prime Minister or the Government considered the serious possibility that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, and not Japan, may abandon its new course? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that regard one is looking as far as one can see into the future not only in relation to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and Japan but also in relation to every other country that is of interest to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a correct interpretation of the Prime Minister’s statement that Australia’s aspirations are being symbolised more with <span class="highlight">China</span> than any other nation and that the Australian Government desires to have the closest identification between Australia’s policies and <span class="highlight">China</span>’s policies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 8 November I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs for an explanation of an expression used by the Prime Minister concerning our new relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia ‘s new aspiration is symbolised more in our relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> than with any - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Did the Prime Minister use this expression because he liked the sound of the words or does he regard the expression as being significant in explaining our new relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have my own views on our relationship with <span class="highlight">China</span> and with all other nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chairman  Mao and his offsider helped to overthrow the successor to  Dr Sun  Yat-sen on the mainland of <span class="highlight">China</span> a little over 20 years ago but that is not an illegal regime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the big sales Australia has made to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> possibly are assisting in raising standards in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, the criticism that arises is that there seems to be an insinuation that the Prime Minister’s remark implies uncritical support and gives undue weight to our relations with the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With no nation is our new aspiration symbolised more than it is with <span class="highlight">China</span>, a power not only in our region but in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The establishment of diplomatic relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> was one of the first foreign policy initiatives of the new Government and it is thus a convenient symbol of this new international outlook. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Government refused to recognise the existence of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> and refused to treat with reason and tolerance various countries, the doors to which have now been opened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-On 6 November I asked the Minister for Primary Industry whether it was correct that  Dr Cairns  had signed an agreement with the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> regarding proposed wheat sales and whether it was also correct that the Australian Wheat Board had signed a contract with the Chinese on the wheat sales themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>More than forty governments have recognised or maintained relations with the new Chilean regime, including all Latin American states (except Cuba), the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, New Zealand, West Germany, Sweden, and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it also a fact that the much publicised wheat agreement with <span class="highlight">China</span> covers only the next 3 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have the Minister for Primary Industry and the Minister for Overseas Trade given consideration to securing from <span class="highlight">China</span> a concrete agreement for the sale of wheat beyond the 3-year term as a condition of supplying <span class="highlight">China</span> during the period of world shortage? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the length of our agreement with <span class="highlight">China</span> is a matter of negotiation between the Australian and Chinese Governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not aware of what discussions may have taken place in relation to supplying <span class="highlight">China</span> with wheat beyond that period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question refers to the reported sale of sugar to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-75-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Northern Development  (Dr Patterson)  has informed me that the Australian sugar marketing authorities were aware of his intention to discuss in Peking the question of permanent access for Australiansugar to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-75-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such discussions were a natural sequel  to  talks  Dr Patterson  had in Peking when he first visited <span class="highlight">China</span> with  Mr Whitlam  in 1 97 1 , to the signing of the Trade Agreement between Australia and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in July 1973, and to the efforts to sell sugar to <span class="highlight">China</span> pursuedatthe commercial level  by  the industry itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-75-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In dealing with the question of aid, as honourable senators know- I have said it many times- the Government’s policy is to contribute to the post-war reconstruction of all countries in Indo <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having, however, learned of the honourable senator’s interest in the drinking habits of his colleagues (Senate Hansard 21 November 1973, page 1954), I have ascertained that 35 bottles of champagne were consumed in flight during my trip to Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span>; 17 bottles were of Australian origin and 1 8 bottles of French. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, some 360 litres of Australian champagne (80 gallons) were sent to <span class="highlight">China</span> in response to the Australian Ambassador’s proposal that Australian wines be served at the Australian Government’s two official functions in Peking, a reception at the Australian Embassy for 200 guests and a return banquet at the Great Hall of the people for 550 guests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 7 November 1973, after the Prime Minister’s return from his recent visit to Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span>, he spoke in the House of Representatives about those visits and tabled certain documents relating to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether at a time when the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics were giving actual military aid to the Forces of North Korea then engaged in hostilities against Australian troops in the field, Wilfred Burchett then had any professional relationship, remunerated or not, with either of those Governments: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-10-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs: Is the report correct that the Chinese Government has protested about the reporting by Australian journalists based in <span class="highlight">China</span> concerning the interesting events now developing in <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason, despite many years of opposition by the conservative parties in Australia, one of the first actions which we took upon election was to establish diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is a course with which we persevered and which we have now brought to fruition by the establishment of diplomatic relations with the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All other countries cither have taken or are in the process of taking precisely the same step which we took in recognising the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in saying that the government of <span class="highlight">China</span> was the government in Peking and not the government on an offshore island, and that if there was to be peace in our area and in the whole world, however much some may agree or disagree with the policies of the Chinese Government, we needed to have friendly relations with that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No longer can Australia be accused of engaging in any form of aggression in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the possibilities of a settlement in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, particularly in Vietnam, the problems are by no means finished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we intend to do, and what we have done, is to work within the United Nations, to work with our friends and with those countries with which we have diplomatic relations, to see that there is a secure peace in Vietnam and in Cambodia and in the whole of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another major conflict, one in regard to which it seems probable that very little can be done by Australia, is the conflict which has developed between the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However I think we have to recognise that in the case of <span class="highlight">China</span> and in the case of the Soviet Union they are countries which, with whatever favourable aspects they may present, and indeed have presented, are dictatorships and that there are disputes as to which of them should have hegemony, if not throughout the whole world, at least in part of the world between the leaders of those 2 countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly I think it has to be said that a contributing factor- I would not suggest that it is a major factor because I think there are other more important factors involved over which we never did have any influence- involved in the present intransigence of the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span> is the many years of isolation in which both countries were placed after their revolutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think it should be any wonder that both the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span> should be extraordinarily suspicious countries, that both of them should be countries with which it is very hard for the other nations of the world to have sensible and sane dealings in view of the treatment which was meted out to both of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at the same time, that action has been very mild compared with the campaigns of economic boycotts and sanctions which were carried out for almost 2 decades against the Soviet Union and against the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, largely at the behest of the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe they are both wrong, but I think that while we are looking at the situation of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union we have to give some recognition to the historical reasons which have given rise to the difficulties which we now find in dealing with them and to see, insofar as we can, that these policies are not continued in the future because these are things to which the Australian Labor Party is opposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To a large extent the major difficulties between the United States of America and the Soviet Union, and perhaps to a lesser extent between the United States of America and <span class="highlight">China</span>, have been resolved as a result of some of the initiatives taken by the major powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now it seems to be generally accepted that the U.S.A. and the Soviet Union, and on the other hand the U.S.A. and <span class="highlight">China</span>, are taking all sorts of measures to prevent a conflict breaking out between those nations or any nations closely associated with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to have an agreement, a working understanding with the other super powers, whether it be <span class="highlight">China</span> or the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In <span class="highlight">China</span> ‘s approach to relations with other countries, we find a welcome emphasis on the principles of the equality of states and respect for the rights and views of small and middle powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this context, <span class="highlight">China</span>’s support for the principles of respect for the national sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all states can make a significant contribution to strengthening peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With no nation is our new aspiration symbolised more than it is with <span class="highlight">China</span>, a power not only in our region but in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we came into office about 15 months ago we had no relations at all with <span class="highlight">China</span>, one of the neighbours in our area, a country of 800 million people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Government has done is to insult and to deceive the British, the Americans, the French, the Singaporeans, the Malaysians, the Cambodians and the South Vietnamese whilst picking up some more than dubious friends in <span class="highlight">China</span>, East Germany, North Korea and any other communist state that shows its head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As would be expected, the Speech makes a special reference to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before we go off on the trail of the KGB let us look at the circumstances in which we went to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam  went to <span class="highlight">China</span> before he became Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made an announcement in advance that a Labor government would, as soon as it was elected, recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was no talk about terms and conditions, although before he left he did say that Australia should recognise <span class="highlight">China</span> on the Canadian formula, which meant that we would take note of the position of Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Mr Nixon  went to <span class="highlight">China</span> shortly afterwards, for some reason which I have never been able to understand all our Press pundits announced that there was now no difference in the approach towards <span class="highlight">China</span> between the Liberal and Country Parties and the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course there was a fundamental difference because when Nixon went to <span class="highlight">China</span> he went proclaiming that he went without prejudice to old friends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was talk of appropriating the funds held in the Bank of <span class="highlight">China</span> in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were statements from the Department of Foreign Affairs that a doubtful title would be given to the property owned by the then Ambassador from free <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had 2 further examples of the subservience of the present administration to <span class="highlight">China</span> when at the last minute the SEATO naval exercises were cancelled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might interest honourable senators opposite to know that the maps currently selling in the equivalent of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Peking- it is not called that; I forget its correct title- show Chinese territory extending not only to include all Korea but right down to include the whole of Indo <span class="highlight">China</span>, Singapore, Malaya and part of Indonesia and, of course, the whole of Burma. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Paracel Islands were aggressively grabbed by <span class="highlight">China</span> a few weeks ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We heard no scream from this Government about this act of aggression because so far as this Government is concerned <span class="highlight">China</span> can do no wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today in <span class="highlight">China</span> many people are finding what they regard as new signs of internal disorder or internal convulsion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lessons in <span class="highlight">China</span> are that each purge since 1949 has brought increasing power to the hard liners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It would be a brave man who would forecast where <span class="highlight">China</span>’s policy is likely to lead in the next 5 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ageing leadership of <span class="highlight">China</span>, and inevitability of change and the lack of knowledge as to who the future leaders are likely to be, their policies or the internal policies of <span class="highlight">China</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was only when the Red Guard got out of control that the army came back to smash the Red Guard because of the fear of where the policies of the Red Guard were leading <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I am speaking of are the uncertainties in the world, the uncertainties in relations between the United States and Japan, between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia and between Japan, <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All indications point to the area between the northwest of Australia through to the <span class="highlight">China</span> Sea becoming, in the foreseeable future, one of the great energy producing areas of the world, and that inevitably will bring big power competition and big power conflict to our shores. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the most obvious area of competition between Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the day that the peace treaty was signed between the Israelis and the Egyptians, <span class="highlight">China</span> did a grab or takeover of the Paracels, which was followed very quickly by a move on the South Vietnamese on the Spratlys. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the dinner given in Peking on Sunday night by the Government of <span class="highlight">China</span>, hosted by Premier Chou En-lai and Madam Mao, to leaders of the Australian Communist Party,  Mr Ted  Hill and  Mr Norm  Gallagher, and the statement reported in the Press as having been made at that dinner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the report that Japan has requested Australia to act as as honest broker between Japan and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No such request has been made and it is very unlikely that it would have been made because there is quite a good relationship between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have arranged trade agreements with countries such as East Germany, North Korea and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In years gone by when Canada moved in on the Chinese wheat export trade, Australia was involved in a sort of double standard as to whether it was contrary to the concepts of our rigid foreign policy to trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The countries are as follows: Afghanistan, Albania, Argentina, Austria, Barbados, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Byelorussian SSR, Canada, Central African Republic, Chile, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Congo, Costa Rica, Cuba, Cyprus, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, Gabon, Democratic Republic of Germany, Federal Republic of Germany, Ghana, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Laos, Lebanon, Madagascar, Malawi, Malta, Mauritius, Mongolia, Nepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Norway, Pakistan, Philippines, Poland, Republic of Korea, Romania, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Spain, Swaziland, Sweden, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukrainian SSR, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, United Kingdom, Yugoslavia, Zambia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was there some breakdown in communication between the Australian and Chinese Governments when an invitation was extended for a ping-pong team to visit <span class="highlight">China</span> and instead preparations were made to send an Australian Rules Team? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently, that led to international recognition between the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will the Minister explain why Australia opposed the inclusion of <span class="highlight">China</span> in a protest against atmospheric nuclear testing which was issued by the South Pacific Forum? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the latter part of his question the honourable senator asked why we opposed a specific mention of <span class="highlight">China</span> in the communique. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ask: Can we expect the Prime Minister to issue an invitation to <span class="highlight">China</span> to establish a scientific facility here merely to snub the United States? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before each election the menace of communism, of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union was trotted out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Russia fears <span class="highlight">China</span>’s nuclear capacity in the 1980s and <span class="highlight">China</span> has a continued fear of a preemptive nuclear strike by Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is based mainly on <span class="highlight">China</span>’s fear of Russia and there are, unfortunately, growing signs of increasing tension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>’s future policies to which I referred briefly, and her future leadership are unknown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The cultural revolution in <span class="highlight">China</span> continues unabated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One fears the judgment of the Prime Minister,  Mr Whitlam,  on <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to be affected by his amorous affair with the present Chinese leaders and with <span class="highlight">China</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No one knows what will be the future direction of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In South-East Asia the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> war continues unabated, and no one knows what the result there will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the indications are, of course, of growing competition or influence between Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span> in South-East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me point out that right throughout South-East Asia there are guerrilla forces supplied and countenanced by Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> admits it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Thai diplomat told me that when one of his own country’s principal ministers went to Peking to discuss with the Chinese the insurgency and subversion movement on their borders which is supported and financed by <span class="highlight">China</span>, he asked Chou En-lai whether <span class="highlight">China</span> would agree to stop interfering in his country’s affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It relates to the action taken recently by the Minister at the South Pacific Forum to oppose and to achieve opposition to the inclusion of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> with France in a resolution condemning nuclear tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam,  as Leader of the Opposition, protested to <span class="highlight">China</span> when he visited that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has protested to the Chinese since he has become Prime Minister and we have specifically sent our Ambassador to <span class="highlight">China</span> to protest to the Chinese again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable senator well knows, the reason we took France to the International Court of Justice and did not take <span class="highlight">China</span> to the Court was that <span class="highlight">China</span> never accepted the jurisdiction of the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator is quite right when he says that this Government has negotiated long term agreements with countries such as <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Referring specifically to agreements with <span class="highlight">China</span>- this matter really falls within the portfolio of the Minister for Overseas Trade and not mine- the only agreements that have been reached with the Chinese authorities of which I am aware are in the areas of wheat and sugar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not aware of any decisions that have been made in relation to the dairy industry but I do believe that informal discussions have taken place to see what prospects there are for dairy products in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Bangladesh incident when it looked as though there would be a massive conflict between the Russians and Chinese and when it was rumoured throughout the world that the Russians might make a pre-emptive strike against the nuclear installations in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the period when the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  was having an amorous love affair with the Chinese leaders he referred to <span class="highlight">China</span> as that peaceful nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The events in <span class="highlight">China</span> today do not give us any reason to feel confident about the future of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s policies, and  Dr Millar  recognises this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his report he refers to the Paracels, the Spratlys and other areas of possible conflict in the <span class="highlight">China</span> Sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fighting is continuing in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> where 13 or 14 regular divisions of the North Vietnamese army are stationed on South Vietnamese soil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I notice that in <span class="highlight">China</span>, from the age of about 10 years, children are taught something about war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Australian Government is unable to take action against <span class="highlight">China</span> in the World Court as it can against France, will the Leader of the Government request the Prime Minister to consider instructing the  Deputy  Prime Minister,  Dr J.  F. Cairns, to cancel his planned visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> to open the Peking fair as a form of protest? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the Leader of the Government regard such a step as an effective form of protest at <span class="highlight">China</span>’s continuing and callous disregard of the welfare of its people and of the people of the world? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Australian Government, through the Prime Minister, has already made an emphatic protest against the conduct of the nuclear tests by the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While dealing with foreign affairs I point out that recently I returned from a visit to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> which is a socialist state and a totally organised economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the report is correct will the Prime Minister protest in a similar way against the Chinese atmospheric nuclear tests by refusing any invitation to attend receptions given by the Ambassador of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> until such time as <span class="highlight">China</span> discontinues atmospheric nuclear tests, thereby demonstrating the Government’s much vaunted evenhandedness? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has made clear on many occasions its opposition to the conduct of atmospheric nuclear weapons tests by France and <span class="highlight">China</span> and by any other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators want to take this argument to extremes- I am sure that some of them have been to Russia, and I have been to <span class="highlight">China</span>- they should take a look at the socialised medical services of those 2 countries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Russia has had 50 years to make socialised health work and <span class="highlight">China</span> 25 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-My question is directed to the Minister for Agriculture and refers to recent Press reports that <span class="highlight">China</span> has bought another large amount of wheat from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has negotiated a 3-year wheat contract with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are going to have the ‘Fiddler of the Electoral Boundaries’ starring the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly),  who cannot even send carpet tacks to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He cannot even organise sending a kitchen sink to Red <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This policy has been criticised by the Opposition from the beginning -over <span class="highlight">China</span>, over North Vietnam and over North Korea- although the Opposition conveniently forgets this Government has also recognised the new regime in Chile, a decision which was most emphatically not made without grave thought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was an important provision, required as much by the North Vietnamese, the PRG, the U.S.S.R. and <span class="highlight">China</span> (in relation to their non-recognition of the Saigon government) as by the Americans, the GVN French, British, Canadians etc, who do not recognise the PRG. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is done in the context of the Government’s even-handed approach to Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both these groups are well placed to disburse assistance to the whole of IndoChina, including North Vietnam, and areas under the control of the PRC, the Pathat Lao in Laos, and the antigovernment forces in Cambodia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While fully sympathising with the sentiment that political prisoners, wherever held, should be released, we must not forget that there has been war in Indo <span class="highlight">China</span> more or less continuously for at least two decades. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My final observation is that the infringements of political and individual rights to which you refer are not confined to Vietnam or to Indo <span class="highlight">China</span>, or indeed to the several other countries listed in the last paragraph of your letter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other matters that were referred to the Committee deal with Thailand, the recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the status of Taiwan, and the role of ANZUK. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we have seen in the period in which the Labor Party has been in power a new subservience, and it is a subservience to the Soviet Union, to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> and to the nations of the Third World. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My friend jibes at me about the recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>, but  Mr Peacock  says that he would not alter the situation and agrees with what this Government has done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I come to the matter of Taiwan which this Government recognises as a province of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is worth noting in this respect that the latest reports from the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> indicate that that country’s foreign policy is again being dictated by its desire to lead the Third World. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we look at the world we find Europe in disarray, <span class="highlight">China</span> in internal disarray, instability - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We established diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Liberal Party say that if it were elected to government it would cancel recognition of the Government in Peking and say that the real Government of <span class="highlight">China</span> is in Taipei? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both the Government in Taipei and the Government in Peking claim to be the government of the whole of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Opposition saying that we should go back to recognising Taipei and that we ought to try to exclude <span class="highlight">China</span> from the councils of the world, from the trade which it is engaged in with this country and other countries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did we hear any condemnation from the other side of politics in this country when Britain hastened to recognise Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> in 1 949, long before any other country did? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will freely withdraw that comment if  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack can show me evidence of his condemnation of a premature recognition of Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> by Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have got our political relations right with the United States, with Japan, with <span class="highlight">China</span>, with Indonesia- with the United States, the most powerful nation in  earth,  with Japan, our greatest trading partner, with <span class="highlight">China</span>, the most populous nation on earth, with Indonesia, the great next door neighbour of ours . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If anybody stopped me from leaving the Soviet Union or <span class="highlight">China</span> I know that I would expect my country to defend me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe it is to sell a bit of wool to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody has been prepared to tell us but we know that wool was sold to Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reality of the situation is that the Government of the island of Taiwan is not the Government of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite impossible to recognise both Chinas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if any country wanted to do that, neither Taiwan nor the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> would accept it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reality of the situation is that the Government of Taiwan is not the Government of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we will not allow officials claiming to represent the Government of Taiwan as the Government of <span class="highlight">China</span> to take part in these negotiations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, we cannot permit the entry into Australia of persons from Taiwan representing the so-called state or Government of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, or Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we made the decision to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span> and to open up that market, what did the members of the Liberal and Country Parties do? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They came along and said: ‘Yes, if we are returned to government we will continue to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this Parliament we have heard much criticism of this Government and of its policy of trading with <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it had been made by <span class="highlight">China</span> or the Shah of Iran, the Government might have accepted it, but the Government could not accept it from the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that when  Dr Cairns  was in Peking he did not hesitate to question the attitude of mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> to atomic explosions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be remembered that this relaxation of tensions which has been brought about by our understanding with countries with different ideological attitudes- I am referring now to <span class="highlight">China</span> on the one hand and Indonesia on the other- has meant that we have not had to be committed to excessive defence expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact,  Senator Greenwood,  the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, crossed the border into <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a time when our predecessors had hang-ups about relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime Canada, one of the Commonwealth countries, was cornering the wheat market with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to that we opened up potential markets involving, I think, 800 million people in the trade pacts we have signed with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs been drawn to a reported speech by the  Deputy  Prime Minister,  Dr J.  F. Cairns, in <span class="highlight">China</span> in which he is reported to have said: ‘While Australia can claim to be no more than an honorary member of the Third World, the independent foreign policy we look for is really a Third World policy’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister’s statement represented Australia’s official policy, will this be conveyed to the Government of the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> so as to prevent any misunderstanding as to our official policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was really set up for the containment of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth respectfully showeth: whereas the countries and peoples now being administered by communist governments-Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Russia, <span class="highlight">China</span>, North Korea, North Vietnam, Romania, Yugoslavia, Mongolia, East Germany, Bulgaria, Albania and Cuba- are entrapped by political and economic ideals repugnant to Australian concepts of liberty and fair play; and whereas the freedom of religion, assembly, speech, movement, fair trial, and enterprise are denied to these people by their governments; and whereas Opposition political parties are suppressed, the right to strike refused, and conscripted labour cruelly exploited by these same governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether it is a fact that the Government is inviting the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to take over the plant of the Leyland Motor Corporation of Australia Ltd in Sydney? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>You shall make a film on how excellent was the  Deputy  Prime Minister’s performance when he went to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The illustration given by  Senator Greenwood  was that a Minister of the Crown could perhaps go to <span class="highlight">China</span> and be photographed there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reverse situation could happen- a member of the Opposition could go to <span class="highlight">China</span> and be photographed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would not be ashamed of the fact that I have been to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know  Senator Greenwood  would not be ashamed of the fact that he went to <span class="highlight">China</span> to see for himself just what went on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators look at it in that way and say that there is a team from the Film Commission going to <span class="highlight">China</span> today and they will show the film tomorrow, they have a pretty poor conception of what artists would do in the making of a good film. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of Press reports in many newspapers this morning that the Minister for Overseas Trade,  Dr Cairns,  had offered the Leyland plant in Sydney to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, will the Government now make a full statement as to why it has sought this particular type of foreign investment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What  Senator Greenwood  and the Opposition are saying is that all of the people employed by Film Australia and all of the productions of Film Australia are to be put in the same category as films from South Africa, United States, Canada, <span class="highlight">China</span> or wherever it might be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, I believe that the huge nations- Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span>- made no formal or specific commitments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are very proud to go to <span class="highlight">China</span> and prove to the Third World that we have an interest in it, but if we really have an interest in the Third World it ought not to be measured by whether we get votes for the Presidency of the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Referring specifically to an incident during the recent visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> of the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Dr J. F.

    <p>However, fresh fission product fall-out is still reaching Australia from the recent series of nuclear tests by France in Polynesia and fallout over Australia of long-lived radioisotopes will continue for some years from the high yield explosions that both France and <span class="highlight">China</span> have carried out in the atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-45-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the earlier part of this year I was privileged to pay a fortnight ‘s visit to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and during that time there was the Christian festival of Easter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even though it is a movable feast it was not celebrated in <span class="highlight">China</span> as there are no churches in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a policy in <span class="highlight">China</span> that the woman is equal to a man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> has this policy, it appeared to me that all that it meant was that the burdens of being a woman were added to by the burdens of being a man and part of the workforce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would point out that 62 per cent of the work force in <span class="highlight">China</span> is women because most of the men are in the armies which police the country because being a socialist country it has to be a police state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In <span class="highlight">China</span> there is a totally planned economy with directions coming down as edicts from above. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In <span class="highlight">China</span> families grow apart, particularly as under socialism there is a direction of labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This may be very well for the people of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In <span class="highlight">China</span> marriage is easy, as the honourable senator who interjected wants; divorce is easy; abortion is easy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are no parties in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I might add as an interpolation that there are trade unions in <span class="highlight">China</span> but they exist to ensure that production teams meet their production goals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When a marriage is dissolved in <span class="highlight">China</span> there is no problem about property settlement simply because there is no private property there- no private cars, no private houses, no private land, no private businesses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So <span class="highlight">China</span> is without problems in the marriage field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen going through this place over the past almost 2 years a whole pattern of legislation that is geared to socialism and the control of the people by the state as exists in <span class="highlight">China</span> where the interests of the people are in all respects subservient to the state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not want to happen in this country things such as  Senator Sheil  has described in relation to <span class="highlight">China</span> where, if the whole system of marriage has broken down completely, the children are taken away and kept in an institution so that the mother can go back to work because she has to do a good deal more than half the work to let the menfolk fight in the services and suchlike. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Minister for Transport has shown some interest in reciprocal arrangements with <span class="highlight">China</span> in respect of Chinese vessels and the Australian National Line operating in the <span class="highlight">China</span>-Australia trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These arrangements would develop as trade agreements developed between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Australia and it is hoped that both countries can participate in this arrangement by having their own flagships operating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Representatives of the Australian National Line have just visited <span class="highlight">China</span>, primarily in support of the Australian trade display at Peking, and while there took the opportunity to discuss such questions with their counterparts in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, with respect to <span class="highlight">China</span> there is a belief that with the development of mutual understanding and increased trade we can get to a position where we can have reciprocal arrangements between the Chinese shipping company and the Australian National Line on chartering rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs: Is he aware of widespread reports alleging that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is a major producer of and trafficker in drugs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he also aware of a report that in 1952 the UN issued a warning to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> following reports of her involvement in drug trafficking and that since that date evidence from many countries continues to implicate the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in this trade? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Prime Minister has referred to Australia’s relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> as most closely representing Australia’s new aspirations and in view of the Government’s de jure recognition of the incorporation of the Baltic States in the Soviet Union, does the Minister agree with the statement of <span class="highlight">China</span> ‘s opposition to the Soviet incorporation of the Baltic States? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At one time the fact that anything was said by Russia or <span class="highlight">China</span> was automatically sufficient indication of the error of the statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now  Senator Sim  seems to be starting to use <span class="highlight">China</span> as an authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs will recall that a few weeks ago I asked a question based on reports alleging that <span class="highlight">China</span> was involved in the drug traffic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But  Senator Webster  and his colleagues in the Country Party will be delighted and will rub their hands with glee over our wheat sales to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why are the Liberal and Country Parties not honest and say: Do not sell any wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span> or North Korea, or allow any other exports to East Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The policy of the Repatriation Commission on the use of acupuncture for repatriation beneficiaries was based on the report which was issued in 1974 by the National Health and Medical Research Council and which followed, as  Senator Baume  has reminded us, a visit by an investigating team which studied the subject in Korea, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Hong Kong and the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The history of government interference in Wheat Board affairs goes back at least to 1967 when a member of the Wheat Board,  Mr H.  F. Smith, reported to a Farmers Union meeting in Perth that the Government had instructed a Board delegation to deliver a note to representatives of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in Hong Kong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has it at any time used its supposed or claimed influential position with the Government of Russia and the Government of <span class="highlight">China</span> to urge those governments to desist sending supplies and equipment to North Vietnam which enable it to mount the massive onslaught on South Vietnam in breach of the Paris Accords? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If that is not its proposal, then what criticism of substance can it have against my Government’s attitudes or actions with regard to IndoChina now or at any time in the past 2 years and 4 months? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the heady days when Vietnam was a popular war, when it was a political goldmine, before the people of Australia came to see its implications and consequences for Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was in 1954 that in this House I first warned against Australian or American military involvement in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the United States’ honour and interests do lie in helping rebuild a unified Vietnam, the unification of which misguided policies, mistaken policies of the past so long delayed; the United States’ honour and interest lie in helping to rebuild an Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> to the devastation of which those policies so greatly contributed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The really important factors and relations are those which have been developed by the Australian Government since December 1972- our relations with our closest and largest neighbour Indonesia, our relations with our greatest trading partner Japan, our relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>, our active support for development of co-operation between ASEAN members, our efforts to ensure that the Indian Ocean does not become the next area of confrontation between the super-powers as Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> became, in a sense, the first. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, Australia’s security, as with the peace of the world, rests ultimately upon making the detente between the United States and the Soviet Union a success and with associating <span class="highlight">China</span> in a wider detente. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he does, how can he explain the flagrant violations by the North Vietnamese in constructing new military roads and airfields in areas under their control, and also the continual movement of troops and sophisticated equipment provided by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and <span class="highlight">China</span> from the day the Agreements were signed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is probably the only bright light on the present horizon but it, too, has to be looked at against a background of constantly rising costs and against a background of good harvests in the major producing countries of the world, namely, America, Canada, <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Nor did he make any attack on the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> for supplying the North Vietnamese with arms, until today the North Vietnamese are regarded as the third biggest military power in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what about the frustration of the South Vietnamese who had full knowledge that North Vietnam in complete breach of the agreements was being armed in a massive way by the Soviet Union and the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However the plain fact is that the Government lacked the courage to take the Parliament and the people into its confidence as to its true policies in relation to Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the first papers that was issued by the United States Administration concerning its intervention in Vietnam referred to the weapons that had been captured from the forces fighting for the so-called Vietcong, the National Liberation Front, and only 2V4 per cent of those weapons were manufactured in a country with a communist government, such as the Soviet Union, <span class="highlight">China</span> or Czechoslovakia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the fact that we export to <span class="highlight">China</span> considerably more in value that we import, will the Minister assure the Senate that the Government will insist that <span class="highlight">China</span> obeys the voluntary restraints for which Australia asks or else Australia will establish a protective barrier against cheap imports from <span class="highlight">China</span> or any other country that has been flooding Australia with cheap clothing to the detriment of the textile industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Dramatic changes were also needed in our foreign policy, which is not relevant to the Budget but which I think is indicative of the attitudes which had been pursued by our predecessors, which had led us into the disaster in Vietnam and which had caused this country to pursue the most asinine policies with regard to the recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span> and other countries which play a major role in world affairs and without whose cooperation and without talking to whom it is impossible for Australia to play any constructive role in world peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One may have thought that a body that is expert in trading with a centrally planned economy such as <span class="highlight">China</span> would be one whose views should be sought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I have already quoted the opinion of the Australia-<span class="highlight">China</span> Business Co-operation Committee, which is an expert body in trading with a centrally planned economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Japanese have bilateral arrangements with <span class="highlight">China</span> and with Russia to exchange trade for coal from Siberia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Wheat Board and the Australian Wool Corporation, for instance, are 2 examples of statutory corporations operating successfully in trade with countries such as <span class="highlight">China</span>, Russia and many countries of the eastern European bloc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, I can recall from early in 1 970 to very late in 1 972, a period when wheat quotas had imposed significant hardships upon the Australian wheat industry and Australian wheat growers- they were imposed by a Liberal-National Country Party Government- and the nation was rather desperate in a search for wheat markets we failed to make sales to our major wheat market, <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the reason for this was that <span class="highlight">China</span> had been so consistently insulted by the Leader of the National Country Party,  Mr Anthony,  that it had decided in an extreme buyers’ market to purchase no grain from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Anthony  showed his concern for the rural community and for Australian exports in a statement issued in February 1 972 when he said that he would not sell his soul for trade and that he did not care if we never sold a bushel of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel it would be remiss of the Senate to overlook a motion of condolence that has been moved in another place this day on the death of the Premier of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, Chou En-lai. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760217_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With Chou En-lai ‘s death, <span class="highlight">China</span> lost one of her great leaders and the world lost one of this century’s outstanding men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A determined revolutionary, he was a major actor in the turbulence of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s revolutionary period and beyond, playing the roles of party organiser, military leader and intellectual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was second only to Mao Tse-tung in his influence on contemporary <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These explanations of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s role made a significant contribution to world understanding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his last years gravely ill, he worked with grace and composure to maintain and enhance <span class="highlight">China</span>’s internal stability and position in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate records its sincere regret at the death of Chou En-lai, Premier of the State Council of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and expresses to the people of <span class="highlight">China</span> profound regret and to his family tender sympathy in their bereavement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On behalf of the Opposition, I would like to pay a tribute to  Mr Chou  En-lai, Premier of the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, and generally to support the views of  Senator Withers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He not only played a conciliatory role in internal Chinese politics but was mainly responsible for removing the bamboo curtain and leading <span class="highlight">China</span> into open and meaningful relations with the outside world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was Chou En-lai who laid the way to the visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> of  Dr Kissinger  and United States  President  Nixon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He understood the West better than anyone else in <span class="highlight">China</span> and knew that co-existence with nations of various political persuasions was essential in the interest of peace and human welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one of the great statesmen of the twentieth century,  Mr Chou’s  death was a loss not only to <span class="highlight">China</span> but also to the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I desire to be associated with the very generous remarks which have been made in the other place and here by the Government and the Opposition in respect of the passing of Chou En-lai, Prime Minister of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter for great regret that it took so long for the Western world to recognise the capacity of the modern <span class="highlight">China</span> and the capacity of Chou En-lai. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without exception, every person who has had an opportunity to visit the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> must pay tribute to his leadership and to him as an administrator and as a leader in all aspects of human activity including the great improvements in the living standards of the people of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to the credit of those who rule the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and to Chou En-lai particularly that, on his election, the new Australian Prime Minister in one of the first public statements that he made dealt with the area of foreign affairs and stated that he intended to visit the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> to see for himself the progress that has been made and to establish the normal and proper relationship that should exist among all countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even up to 1972, many people had failed to understand the evolutionary movement that was taking place in the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I think it is proper that we should at this time join forces with all people throughout the world in offering our condolences to the ordinary people of <span class="highlight">China</span> at the loss of a person who played such a significant part in the development of modern <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also a major area of struggle between the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span>, and today it is becoming an area of increasing struggle between those 2 communist powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Senate should be reminded that in 1971, referring to  President  Nixon’s statement that the period was one of negotiation, Chou En-lai the then Prime Minister of <span class="highlight">China</span>, commented that the era was still one of armed struggle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present events in Angola, on which I will speak later, and the reaction of <span class="highlight">China</span> to those events highlight the comment that Chou En-lai made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They further highlight my statement that this is one of the major areas of struggle between the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and that it is an area of increasing struggle between those 2 communist powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last night I referred to the Indian Ocean as being a major area of conflict between the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already <span class="highlight">China</span> is reacting to recent events. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that at some stage the rivalry between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia may be used effectively by the United States on some issues, and- what is much more important- it could be used on the new nation of Vietnam, Thailand or any of those countries which will go left. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With their own national aspirations they will go to the brink, some with <span class="highlight">China</span> and others with the Soviet Union, and then they will stop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Primmer  will find that on 25 October this year there will be a prime minister of the independent State of the Transkei which will have the capacity to maintain diplomatic posts from <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The biggest countries in the world, such as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, <span class="highlight">China</span> and the United States of America, have completely different economic problems from those of the smaller countries, such as Ireland and Chile, which have less government in terms of the way in which the lives of the people are determined by government actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we never hear a word about the KGB; we never hear a word about the secret police in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  purpose was to plant in the public mind the suggestion that this was some murky organisation which was in some way connected with the dreadful CIA but not with the KGB and not with the organisation- whatever it is called- in <span class="highlight">China</span> which puts people in dungeons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Sim  said, if there happen to be organisations which painstakingly, as the record discloses, send their agents into the countries of the free world to promote the interests of the Soviet Union, its satellites and Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>, you just ignore what they might be doing because they are not matters for debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conservative inflexibility in developing foreign policy has previously led Australia into the political fiasco and moral shame of our intervention in Vietnam, to an unrewarding and unnecessary era of hostility towards the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, and caused undue friction in our relations with our other Asian neighbours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to reported deletions from the program of the Lhamo Tibetan Folk Theatre, which recently performed in Western Australia, and ask: Will the Minister ascertain whether references to the invasion of Tibet by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> were deleted? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The best customers that we have for primary produce are Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our best customers for wool and wheat at present are <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, he was referring to a very famous Murray Grey bull, Sober Bogong, which went to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These United Nations programs have failed to meet the crisis in these nations much as similar programs in both Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span> have failed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> had a population of 800 million. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>India, with a population of 550 million, was in a much more acute position because it is only one-third the size of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 stated that <span class="highlight">China</span>, for ideological more than economic reasons, sought to lead the Third World. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out that all these programs had failed, as had similar programs in both Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span>- indicating the futility of legislation in trying to fix these problems and showing the dangers of government interference with the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>, with its 800 million people, had tried to limit its population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But India was having far more problems because although its population was only 550 million- if one can use the word only’ in relation to a figure like that- its area is one-third the area of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this morning’s Press,  Mr Nakao,  a member of the Liberal Party in Japan and a director of the Japanese Government’s Standing Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, is reported as saying that he agrees entirely with  Mr Anthony’s  comments that if Australia’s resources are not made available to countries like Japan-  Mr Nakao  went on to mention Korea and <span class="highlight">China</span> as well- they will be taken from us in the years to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We equally share, though for different reasons, concern at the developments in <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union, their impact on each of us and their impact on the region in which Australia and Japan are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We share an interest and concern in developments in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> and the Subcontinent, areas which both of us see as ones of potential instability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I understand it the minds of the people of the dark ages were unlocked because our medieval forefathers, wishing to trade with the Spice Islands, sought a route to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of seeking trade they unlocked all the treasures of the East- of <span class="highlight">China</span>, Japan and the Spice Islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it particularly surprising that that sort of comment should come from a member of a Party which went into an election campaign 10 years ago with an emotive slogan about the downward thrust of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the people who still sit in the benches across the aisle and their friends asserted that they had to stop the downward thrust of <span class="highlight">China</span> and they would not recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, for 3 years we sold not a ton of wheat to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must expect world wheat production again to exceed demand sometime during the next few years, particularly as <span class="highlight">China</span>, traditionally a large if inconsistent importer of our wheat, is becoming selfsufficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grain production in <span class="highlight">China</span> is based mainly on irrigation so it is not affected by droughts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, from first hand knowledge I gained in <span class="highlight">China</span> in 1973, 1 suggest that with her increasing mechanisation, her work on breeding better varieties, her disease and insect control and, just as important, her success with population control, <span class="highlight">China</span> may very well become an exporter of wheat quite soon, in competition with Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a world whose relations also depend however, on the actions of other major powers- <span class="highlight">China</span>, Japan and the European powers- and within particular regions also on the distribution of power between middle and small states. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not in <span class="highlight">China</span>’s interests that the Soviet Union should become dominant in South East Asia, nor in Japan’s interests that the Soviet Union should become dominant in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, it is not, presumably, in the Soviet Union’s interests that relations between <span class="highlight">China</span>, Japan and the United States should be too close. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It means that Australia will involve itself and take sides in the dispute that exists between the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I admit that in view of the hysteria that exists in this country from time to time there may be some political advantage for this Government in that, just as there was political advantage in 1965 in the alleged threats of <span class="highlight">China</span> coming down, with those big broad arrows from the north, to gobble us up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Suddenly <span class="highlight">China</span> has become respectable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the eyes of the Liberal and National Country Parties, <span class="highlight">China</span> is now respectable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It must be seen as part of a thrust by Communist <span class="highlight">China</span> between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people of Australia were stampeded into believing that the downward thrust of <span class="highlight">China</span> was here to stay and we were to be gobbled up by the Chinese, not the Russians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is unfortunate that there has been little time in which to document all the statements which are contained in this speech, but one thing remains paramount above everything else: There has been this dramatic change towards <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was a winning issue in the 1960s to put fear into people’s minds that we were to be gobbled up by <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is an entirely different tone to the attitude of the Soviet Union than there is to that of <span class="highlight">China</span> and that is quite clearly the intention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has one railway, the trans-Siberian railway, which for hundreds of kilometres runs very close to the Manchurian, or Chinese, border and this becomes a very vulnerable link with Russia’s eastern provinces in the event of hostilities with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report shows that our exports to mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> have actually fallen off quite substantially and that we export 5 times as much wool to Taiwan as we do to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It might be argued, as  Senator Sibraa  interjected, that we should cease trade either with <span class="highlight">China</span> or Russia as super powers because of political oppression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He completely disagreed with his Prime Minister who gave this as one of his reasons for the build-up of defence in the Indian Ocean, in view of the changed relationship with Communist <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the death on 9 September 1976 of Chairman Mao Tse-tung, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate records its sincere regret at the death of Chairman Mao Tse-tung, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of <span class="highlight">China</span>, expresses to the people of <span class="highlight">China</span> profound regret and tenders its deep sympathy to his family in their bereavement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was the principal architect of <span class="highlight">China</span> since 1949 and one of the very few men who have had a major impact on the course of world history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He led the Chinese Communist Party through a long and destructive civil war and in his writings set out a new conception of what <span class="highlight">China</span> should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time in many decades Mao Tse-tung gave <span class="highlight">China</span> an effective administration, restored a country ravaged by civil war, and secured the basic necessities of life to <span class="highlight">China</span>’s people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under his leadership <span class="highlight">China</span> assumed a major role in world affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mao Tse-tung ‘s conception of the desirable organisation of a society was not ours, but he achieved peace internally and respect for <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He came to symbolise the new <span class="highlight">China</span> for his own people and for the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In recent years, under his leadership, <span class="highlight">China</span> began to adjust her ideological objectives to the realities of world power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For Australians, it is of considerable significance that, as <span class="highlight">China</span>’s supreme leader, he lent his personal authority to the establishment and further development of <span class="highlight">China</span> ‘s relations with Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Chairman  Mao grew up in the old <span class="highlight">China</span> of war lords, feudalism and foreign domination of trade in its major cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He made a new <span class="highlight">China</span> of independence, self respect, and international status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When Mao was fourteen years of age he was married off, I understand against his will, in the feudal style of that era in <span class="highlight">China</span>’s history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sixtyfour years later it was the same Mao who invited the anti-communist President Nixon to Peking, which was a significant step in easing tension between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the United States and in bringing <span class="highlight">China</span> into the realm of international relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> has lost its helmsman with the death of  Chairman  Mao, but his legacy of a unified nation firmly advancing the welfare of the world ‘s most populous nation and its emergence to its rightful place in international affairs remains with us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I had the privilege of conveying this decision to the Ambassador of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> this morning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This meeting of the Administrative Committee of the Victorian Branch of the Australian Labor Party places on record a motion of condolence to the Government and the people of <span class="highlight">China</span> on the death of  Chairman  Mao, and requests  Senator Bill  Brown … as former  Chairman  of the Party, to sign the book of condolences on behalf of the membership of this Branch, and that a copy of this resolution be sent to the Ambassador of the People ‘s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He became part of the nationalist movement of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his early youth, because of the very strong feeling that existed in mainland <span class="highlight">China</span> about the intervention in the internal affairs of that country by many of the Western powers he became an official of the Kuomintang, which was the revolutionary movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the period from 1934 to 1936 Mao Tse-tung led a small group of men and women from one end of <span class="highlight">China</span> to the other, and 15 years later- on 1 October 1949- he proclaimed the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst nobody necessarily is expected to agree with his philosophy or to understand it, it must be said that he succeeded in unifying <span class="highlight">China</span>, which had not for many centuries been unified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> is the most heavily populated country on the earth and it was a feudal country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we in Western civilisation cannot understand much of what has happened but I think it has to be said that in his efforts to improve the living standards of the people of <span class="highlight">China</span> he largely succeeded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was one of those who made an early pilgrimage to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One could not fail to be impressed with the progress that was being made even 3 short years after the People’s Liberation Army had succeeded in taking over Peking and the whole of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly if India were compared with <span class="highlight">China</span> or the Soviet Union or, for that matter, with its neighbour Pakistan or with the Philippines or Spain or most of the countries in Latin America, India indeed is a very democratic country and it probably still ranks amongst the most democratic countries in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this claim can be refuted by the fact that in the past in India when there were wars on two occasions with Pakistan and on another occasion with <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Indian Government never found it necessary to impose any emergency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a recent report of a nuclear test conducted by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and a further report of heavy radioactivity fall-out in the United States following the reported test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-According to the briefing note I have, <span class="highlight">China</span> has announced that it conducted a further nuclear test in the atmosphere on 26 September and our Ambassador in Peking has been asked to express again our concern to the Chinese authorities about nuclear testing and in particular about the latest Chinese test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761007_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In <span class="highlight">China</span> the Prime Minister responded to his hosts, ingratiating himself with the Chinese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs: Has any protest been made to the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> regarding the nuclear bomb which was exploded by that country during the past week? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the information I gave then- I will check to see whether it is accurate- was that our Ambassador in <span class="highlight">China</span> had been instructed to call upon the Chinese Government to make a protest on behalf of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Government issued a directive to Government departments that the terminology for statistical information relating to <span class="highlight">China</span> and Taiwan be changed to ‘<span class="highlight">China</span>, excluding Taiwan’ and Taiwan, Province of? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were not supporters of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They all confirmed that the Chinese people in Dili were in no way identified with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> but were in fact supporters of Taiwan and all their children were sent to Taiwan for their secondary school education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Members of the Australian Democratic Labor Party had booked themselves out to places like Chile, Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span> and they were trying to get away from Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Entry for each individual is conditional upon his holding an ordinary passport and submitting in advance a written declaration that he will not purport to represent Taiwan, <span class="highlight">China</span> or the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, they should not seek to use a flag, insignia or any other form of identification suggesting that they are national or government representatives of Taiwan, <span class="highlight">China</span> or the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There was a specific instance of the Secretary-General of the Australian Medical Association writing to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 16 July of this year seeking advice on whether visas would be issued to people from Taiwan wishing to take part as representatives of the <span class="highlight">China</span> Medical Association in a congress of the Confederation of Medical Associations in Asia and Oceania to be held in Sydney in 1 977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In replying to  Dr Repin  the Minister,  Mr Peacock,  briefly outlined the conditions governing the entry to Australia of people from Taiwan and suggested that, as  Dr Repin  had indicated it would only be possible for participants from Taiwan to attend as representatives of the <span class="highlight">China</span> Medical Association, it seemed clear that they could not meet the conditions of entry for residents of Taiwan and therefore would not be able to obtain visas to attend the congress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the event it appears that the AMA was unable to make arrangements for the congress which would enable people from Taiwan to take part except as representatives of the <span class="highlight">China</span> Medical Association and accordingly felt obliged to cancel plans for holding the congress in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While accepting that delegations from Taiwan cannot claim to represent <span class="highlight">China</span>, what reasons exist which prevent them from entering Australia claiming to represent Taiwan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer I have received from my colleague is as follows: A clear implication of the commitment that Australia entered into in establishing diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is that care needs to be taken with any proposal that may have the effect of conferring the status of a  separate  and independent country upon Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More than 100 governments have now established diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fewer than 30 governments continue to recognise the so-called Government of the Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> on Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The authorities on Taiwan, like the Government of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, themselves regard Taiwan not as a country but as a province of <span class="highlight">China</span> and firmly reject any claim that Taiwan has any other status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the present case, in accordance with prior arrangements, all shoes worn by the Prime Minister and his accompanying party on agricultural farms in <span class="highlight">China</span>, Hong Kong or Manila were collected before arrival in Australia and placed in plastic bags for examination and disinfection where examination indicated this was necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If those changes occur and if <span class="highlight">China</span> continues to see itself as having to maintain some strong military force because of its problems with its principal neighbour, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the balance of power in the western Pacific region again may be altered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is rather strange that he has not said that <span class="highlight">China</span> was responsible for what happened in Vietnam because, as I understood the map that  Sir Paul  Hasluck used to send to me and what we were told in the Parliament, the Chinese were coming- not the Russians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular there has been a major re-assessment of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Australian Labor Party have always said that we ought to have diplomatic relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>, that it ought to be admitted to the United Nations, that we ought to seek peace with <span class="highlight">China</span> and that we ought to seek trade with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can well remember that for many years members of the Australian Labor Party were accused of being unpatriotic, subversive and traitors to this country because we advocated the policies towards <span class="highlight">China</span> which have now been accepted by this Government without one word of explanation- just a limp little sentence which reads: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all that brouhaha and after sending 400 young Australians to be killed, all the Government can tell us is that someone- unspecifiedhas made a major re-assessment of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>’s earlier isolation was modified by the Australian Labor Government when we entered into diplomatic relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> and when, although we were not members at that stage, we supported the admission of <span class="highlight">China</span> to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were the people who modified <span class="highlight">China</span>’s earlier isolation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Had it been left to honourable senators opposite and had there been people in the United States of America, Great Britain and France who were as silly as they are, <span class="highlight">China</span> would still be isolated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>God knows where we would be today if <span class="highlight">China</span> was still as isolated as honourable senators opposite tonight would have liked to have kept ner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>’s earlier isolation has been modified and it has entered into widespread relations with other governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We welcome the opportunity to develop our relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>; but we recognise the important differences in our political attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Boxer rebels were going to get us in the 1890s, so Australian troops had to be sent off to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a variety of reasons much will depend on how <span class="highlight">China</span>, the closest of the external powers, decides to pursue its interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether we are being asked to accept the idea that perhaps there has been a change in the face of policy on the part of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether it is suggested that <span class="highlight">China</span>’s policy has changed and it no longer seeks to guide and support fraternal parties on a large scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While <span class="highlight">China</span>’s foreign policy may have altered in emphasis over recent years, I suggest there has never been any evidence that <span class="highlight">China</span> has ever changed its view that history has shown it that the world can be liberated from the imperialists and the capitalists provided the correct course is followed; that is, of course, the correct Marxist-Leninist doctrines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chinese Government would question the wisdom of providing large-scale support for insurgency in Malaysia for fear of alienating the established government and driving it maybe further towards the Soviet Union to the disadvantage of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not know whether <span class="highlight">China</span> support on a former scale is now required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not know whether at the moment <span class="highlight">China</span> is concentrating on its domestic problems or whether the Chinese have decided that because of a dispute within the communist parties of South-East Asia they can rely upon them to follow the correct MarxistLeninist line and not turn more and more to the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a competition between the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span> which is a matter of concern for the countries of the ASEAN region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fear is that, if the United States regards South East Asia as an area of low priority, the only two major powers left to compete are the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span>, without the balancing effect of the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that another one of the imponderables and uncertainties is the relationship between the ASEAN states and Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A former senator,  Senator Kennelly-  he is not in this Chamber tonight but I believe he was a distinguished Labor Party senator in former years- drew attention to that threat by asking what was the threat from <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout the 1950s Australian political life was plagued by threats, introduced by the Liberal Party, about invasion from some mythical country- probably <span class="highlight">China</span> or Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what he was doing in terms of his announced policies in relation to the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have pointed out to the Senate on several occasion, the members of the Chinese community in Timor had direct affiliations with and the support of the families of the Taiwanese sections of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought to cast our minds back to the issues relating to Suez, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Vietnam and now the Indian Ocean to see how Australian foreign policy can be changed overnight by the policies of a foreign government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate will recall that it was on that occasion, just prior to his trip to <span class="highlight">China</span>, that the Prime Minister made it quite clear that this Government was taking the very strange and dubious step of involving itself in the Sino-Soviet dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore there is a strong desire not only to maintain United States presencean investment presence as well as a political presence- in the region as a balancing factor but also to ensure that there is a growing Japanese interest in the region, again to balance the presence of the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> which in itself creates uncertainty and some degree of instability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Preeminent amongst them, without any doubt, has been the growth of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in strength and in influence, and the dispute between the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the division between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union would probably be the most serious division which exists in international affairs at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the growth of <span class="highlight">China</span>, which has been one of the major changes leading to the dissolution of this polarisation of the world, there has also been the growth of the European Economic Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note that in the course of his statement the Ministers said that <span class="highlight">China</span>’s foreign policy is concerned to maintain global and regional stability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That statement was made by a Liberal Party Minister for Foreign Affairs: <span class="highlight">China</span>’s foreign policy is concerned to maintain global and regional stability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems like only yesterday that we were told that <span class="highlight">China</span>’s objective was to take over Vietnam, take over Thailand, take over Malaysia, take over Indonesia, and ultimately achieve its heart’s desire and be down here in sampans on Lake Burley Griffin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, everybody now appears to be so eulogistic of <span class="highlight">China</span> that every politician in Australia seems to have entered into a gigantic dim sim eating competition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has recognised that <span class="highlight">China</span> is there, in the same way as the Soviet Union is there, and that we have to deal with both of those countries as governments which have their own interests and set out to pursue their own interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why have the people of Angola and Mozambique turned to the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that it is now fashionable to be very friendly towards the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no open and free discussion within <span class="highlight">China</span> on what is taking place within the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been happening over the last 10 years in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to the Senate that the best way of watching Australia’s interests is by seeking to achieve human rights in Timor, Chile, the Soviet Union, <span class="highlight">China</span> and in every place in the world where they have been denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Indian Ocean which is relatively unimportant among the world’s great oceans and is not bordered by any of the super powers- I include <span class="highlight">China</span> as a super power in this respect- we have an opportunity to achieve a demilitarised zone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect to <span class="highlight">China</span> we have reached a point where we clearly have a considerable trading relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe we have also reached a point of maturity where Australia’s view of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s attitudes to nuclear testing and explosions is clearly understood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can, of course, contribute greatly to <span class="highlight">China</span> with our technological capacity, particularly in the field of agriculture and in arid and semi-arid agriculture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He related it to <span class="highlight">China</span> and believed that our agricultural techniques could be of some assistance to that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to  Senator Scott’s  remarks about <span class="highlight">China</span>, whilst I said that we may have some techniques which would be of assistance to <span class="highlight">China</span> and a number of other countries, it is noticeable that in <span class="highlight">China</span> and in Vietnam, which is a more current example, instead of putting people off the land the governments have put them on the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are tensions between Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span>, 2 major powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt many honourable senators in this chamber have heard the comment that perhaps the world is lucky that Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span> today do not see eye to eye; that it could be the saving grace ofthe world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would be the situation if Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span> were united as a joint force? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to <span class="highlight">China</span>, another important country, and one to which, for years, we as a nation gave no recognition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I commend the Whitlam Government as the government which initiated the moves to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I go further and say that I was very pleased to see that both the Prime Minister and  Mr Peacock,  early in government, made a point of going to <span class="highlight">China</span> and having discussions with its leaders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister, with regard to the various aspects of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s situation and Australia’s attitude towards some of the ideologies of <span class="highlight">China</span>, has made the matter perfectly clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In relation to the developments with <span class="highlight">China</span> he stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>points it is necessary to make about our relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So while we show respect to <span class="highlight">China</span> and while we continue to do so, the Minister has made it clear that we do not agree with all that <span class="highlight">China</span> does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No doubt <span class="highlight">China</span> does not agree with all that Australia does but the main thing is that we continue to talk, to respect each other and to trade together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just as previous LiberalNational Country Party governments were continually wrong-footed on issues such as Suez, the recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>, Vietnam and the aftermath of Vietnam, this Government is showing that it is equally unable to discern friends in the international arena. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the Prime Minister’s visit to <span class="highlight">China</span> in June 1976 resulted in Australia being made somewhat of a laughing stock in the eyes of the international diplomatic community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My colleagues in this place, particularly  Senator Wheeldon,  used to taunt the previous Liberal-Country Party Government about the flexibility of the Canadian Governmentit was not a socialist government- which cornered wheat deals with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It also concerns me that from debate in this House and from discussions outside that foreign affairs debates in this country and in this Parliament seem likely to revert to the sort of blind, prejudicial type of debate we had in the 30 years leading up to 1972- the sort of debate and attitudes that led to our involvement in Vietnam and the unnecessary death and destruction that came out of that and the ridiculous situation which applied up until 1972 when this country did not even recognise the existence of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the government of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would not be proper for me to say that some members of the Government might have had a selective attitude in respect of other events in South East Asia but we are not now trying to apportion blame or to establish who was right on the question of Vietnam or in regard to our relationships with <span class="highlight">China</span> or whether Angola, Mozambique or Chile acted in this and that sort of a way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>ASEAN enjoys only a small share of Australia’s imports of textiles, apparel and footwearunder 10 per cent of the value of such imports from Korea, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Hong Kong and Taiwan combined, and clearly there is room for improvement in this share. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that the opposition of the Labor Party is on ideological grounds and it is just a pity that the lefties in the Labor Party who got this through their conference have not done something about convincing their friends in <span class="highlight">China</span> to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as other countries have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The inclusion of the International Atomic Energy Agency in the membership of the Fund suggests to me that a decision of the Fund can be made by two-thirds of the majority of members to use the fund for some atomic application for better grinding of rice in <span class="highlight">China</span> or elsewhere in Asia, for example. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, of course, in the immediate post- War world, the situation existed in which non-aligned countries or the emerging countries- whatever we call them- had the choice of following what was known as the Westera powers- the democracies- or those countries largely led by the Soviet Union or, to a lesser extent, <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>If that were the case, we would push many very statesmanlike coloured leaders into the camp not of the Third World countries but probably into the camp dominated by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or even <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-I say to  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack that we had the bizarre situation in 1972 when the then Prime Minister,  Mr McMahon,  attacked the then Leader of the Opposition,  Mr E.  G. Whitlam, for going to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack ‘s Prime Minister attacked  Mr Whitlam  for going to <span class="highlight">China</span> in complete ignorance of the fact that  President  Nixon was going there too- something which  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack might recall as a matter of embarrassment to the government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policies of previous governments which arose- I would hope- after consideration of our intelligence information and the assessment of our intelligence information, led to our refusal over many years to acknowledge the existence of the realities of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, and, in fact, led to our involvement in the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly caused much distress to many families in this country and to families in IndoChina and were certainly at wide variance with most other countries in the Western World with which we were normally associated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In has speech in the other place,  Mr Lionel  Bowen made reference to the fact that he believed that we could not have been receiving proper intelligence or assessment of intelligence, because we were so obsessed with this threat that we saw, as demonstrated by our refusal to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, of course, led- as  Senator Button  said- to  Mr McMahon’s  embarrassed hurried flight from Devonport in Tasmania where he had just made a speech criticising the Leader of the Opposition of the day,  Mr Whitlam,  for visiting <span class="highlight">China</span> and he found that  Mr Nixon  was going there and that he had not been informed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister prepared to direct the same criticism against his own Government for changing its policy on the recognition of <span class="highlight">China</span>, changing its policy on a national health scheme, changing its policy on overseas investment in Australian companies, changing its policy on simultaneous elections, and its policy on the payment of a dairy bounty? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Other meetings are taking place at which the United States and Britain appear to be taking the leading role as the foreign powers- this is not an occasion when the Soviet Union, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Cuba or other forces are involved- that are pressing for the so-called external settlement with the Patriotic Front in Rhodesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that he will not have read yesterday’s  Canberra Times  so I shall preface the question by referring to part of it which states that the Australian Film Commission had announced that three members of the Commission had left for <span class="highlight">China</span> the day before to discuss exchanges of film between Australia and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does the Government think that it is necessary for three members of the Film Commission to travel to <span class="highlight">China</span> in order to discuss film exchanges? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, they talked about the very special relationships- warm, close, friendly relationshipsthat they had with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore nations such as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and <span class="highlight">China</span> are showing an increasing interest in the Pacific just as Japan has long had a substantial interest in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was advised by the Minister for Primary Industry whom I represent that, by mutual agreement with <span class="highlight">China</span>, the shipment of  250,000  tonnes which originally was to be shipped during the period January to August  1978  and to which the honourable senator made reference had been deferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia does not, of course, recognise the so-called ‘ Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> Government’ on Taiwan and could not therefore enter into a government-to-government agreement on nuclear safeguards with Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-39-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is that the United States, unlike Australia, recognises the ‘Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> Government’ and is therefore able to have a nuclear co-operation safeguards agreement with it and to export nuclear material to Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-39-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister recollect that only a few years ago members of the present Government parties accused the Australian Labor Party of subversive intent when it advocated the establishment of diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and that indeed those parties when in government - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it not also a fact that the present Government parties, when previously in government, conscripted Australians to fight in Vietnam, one of the reasons claimed for so doing being that the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> presented a threat to Australia and that Australians needed to fight in Vietnam to halt the downward thrust of menacing Chinese communism? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Minister is unable to do this, will he admit that the Government was wrong when it conscripted young Australians a few years ago and when it attacked the Australian Labor Party merely for wishing to have diplomatic relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Anyone who has any understanding of what has happened with regard to the emergence of <span class="highlight">China</span> as a nation knows that for decades post-war <span class="highlight">China</span> pursued an inward-looking policy- in fact, one that did not seek to reach outwards to establish links with the outside world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think that  Senator Wheeldon  really is serious in raising the question of IndoChina because it would do no good for his advocacy if he were to look today at the pitiful state of what is happening to the people in the IndoChina area and the absolute bloodbath of very recent years- for example, the literal bloodbath in places such as Cambodia and Laos. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-If Senator Wheeldon looks at tomorrow’s  Hansard  he will find that I have indeed answered that, but I simply repeat that for several decades post-war <span class="highlight">China</span> itself pursued inward looking policies and not international policies at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Along with the change of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s policies and a widening of her international links Australia in common with other countries was happy to make the diplomatic links with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We call on Vietnam to withdraw its forces from Kampuchea, and on <span class="highlight">China</span> to withdraw its forces from Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since the end of last year events in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> have escalated rapidly and there is no sign of any immediate relief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On Monday last I called for a proper statement to the Parliament on the position in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present situation in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> is a striking example. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the current situation between the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span>, both countries have spoken about punishing another nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A month ago <span class="highlight">China</span> said it would punish Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Press reports today indicate that Russia intends to punish <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this occasion he is apparently on the side of <span class="highlight">China</span> and is opposed to the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He fails to appreciate how foolish it was to vilify another nation the way he did to <span class="highlight">China</span> at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 6 May 1965 he said that <span class="highlight">China</span> has not learned that the West is prepared to use force to protect its vital interests and if she wins in South Vietnam she will never accept the possibility of some kind of co-existence between her Communist regime and the West. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inflammatory and abusive remarks of this nature were typical of the insults that were directed against <span class="highlight">China</span> at that time not only by the present Australian Prime Minister but also by many of his colleagues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It goes right back to the first intergration of <span class="highlight">China</span> by Shih Huang Ti, the first emperor, who was a very efficient person with a very efficient bureaucracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To our knowledge <span class="highlight">China</span> was the first place in the world which identified standards of widths of roads, wheel tracks, measurements and things of that sort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That emperor was so feared and the effect of his death was so feared that when he died away from the enormous capital he had built his body was concealed for weeks by his troops in a load of rotting fish because they were afraid of the consequences to <span class="highlight">China</span> when his death was discovered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is pretty plain that we are not going to do very well just pursuing the old paths, especially in competition with the very energetic Asian industrial revolution that is going on in such places as South Korea, Taiwan and, of course, <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <span class="highlight">China</span> I think there will be a vast industry much faster than people realise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After three and a half years of comparative quiet, South East Asia is again the scene of armed conflict- first with the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea, then with conflict between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conflicts reflect and were created by the hostility and rivalry existing among four states: the Soviet Union, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Vietnam and Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our region the conflict in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> is the greatest cause of concern and I now turn to look in more detail at this and the Government’s reaction to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic situation which now exists in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> is a matter of great concern and disappointment to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation began to deteriorate last year with increasing hostilities between Kampuchea and Vietnam, a worsening relationship between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam and the signing of a treaty of friendship and co-operation, which included a military assistance clause, between the Soviet Union and Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Vietnamese attack on Kampuchea was an attack by a client of the Soviet Union on a client of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever its motivation the attack bore directly on the rivalry and competition between the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span> for long term influence in the region and, more generally, on the whole Sino-Soviet dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>’s subsequent incursion into Vietnam can only be understood as a reaction to Vietnam’s treaty with the Soviet Union, its invasion of Kampuchea and the installation there of a pro- Vietnamese government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span>’s motives in striking across the border do not relate only to a border dispute but are aimed at Vietnam’s political influence in Kampuchea, which is beyond <span class="highlight">China</span>’s immediate reach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam therefore is not likely to be resolved with any element of permanence by a settlement on the VietnamChina border which leaves the situation in Kampuchea unchanged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have called on Vietnam to withdraw its forces from Kampuchea, on <span class="highlight">China</span> to withdraw its forces from Vietnam and on the Soviet Union to exercise restraint to prevent the last turn of the screw, which could be disastrous not merely for the region but for the peace of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has accused the Government of a pro-<span class="highlight">China</span> bias. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the extent that <span class="highlight">China</span> if left alone and unprovoked, would prefer peace and stability at this stage of its development in order to concentrate on internal modernisation, and only to that extent, there is a convergence between its present interest and ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He emphasised that there should be immediate cease-fires in the conflicts, that Vietnam must withdraw its forces from Kampuchea and <span class="highlight">China</span> must withdraw its forces from Vietnam, and that there should be concerted efforts leading to lasting settlements, possibly using the good offices of the Secretary-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the changes which have taken place at that level- the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the United States and <span class="highlight">China</span>, the expansion of Japan’s relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>- are in themselves desirable; but what significance they will ultimately have will depend on how they fit into a picture which is not yet complete. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for these reasons that we made a real effort to prevent the situation in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> from developing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that all who have followed the events there to some extent have kept their fingers crossed that the disputes, especially that between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam, would not involve other nations and particularly the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He does say in more places than one in the course of the speech that the Government has wished to play a constructive role in this area of dispute and yet the conflict which has really brought the immediate concern on us, namely, the Chinese attack on Vietnam, following the Vietnamese attack on Kampuchea, involves us with a couple of nations with which this Government has had much involvement over the past 10 years, and indeed in the case of <span class="highlight">China</span> going back a lot further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I indicated in a speech last week, we are dealing with a government which years ago made a speciality of heaping abuse and vilification upon <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last week I quoted some of the things which the present Prime Minister said in the middle 1960s- provocative, inflammatory remarks about <span class="highlight">China</span> which obviously could only enable that country to believe that its enemies were not only to the north and west of it but also could be very far to the south. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> has now taken the view, for reasons best understood by itself, that it wishes to take a much different and more conciliatory approach towards the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who took the trouble to read the interview with the Chinese Vice Premier, Deng Xiaoping, in  Time  magazine only two or three weeks ago would not be left with any illusions as to the reason for <span class="highlight">China</span>’s new approach to the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has not isolated <span class="highlight">China</span> in the world community and our record, for at least two decades, is one of ensuring that <span class="highlight">China</span> was not the odd man out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1972, before we came to Government, we took the initiative, as a party, to send a deputation to <span class="highlight">China</span> in order to try and establish a relationship between the Australian Labor Party and the Chinese authorities, one not based on hostility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we do not need to apologise for or explain the fact that we have never attempted to pursue the line, or to support those who advocated the line, that <span class="highlight">China</span> should in some way be isolated from the world community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite apparent now that the present Government also does not want to see <span class="highlight">China</span> isolated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government feels that is the position, I would suggest that it not repeat the mistakes that it made in the 1950s and 1960s by forcing, or helping to force, <span class="highlight">China</span> into a state of isolation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was reported in the media a fortnight ago, after a Press conference in Singapore, as saying that he was concerned with a pro-<span class="highlight">China</span> tilt developing in the Australian Government’s attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to say how important it is that the Government maintain a balance in its relationship between the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reject the contention by the Minister that our criticism of a pro-<span class="highlight">China</span> attitude is an invalid one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole world seems to be a tinder-box of conflicts at the moment, with the acute troubles in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, the sudden events in the Middle East and the events in Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, having been to the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, I know that the Chinese are concerned about the encirclement of their country by the Russians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the conflict in Vietnam and the antagonisms between the two different communist forces in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, the Russians moved in to support one side; so the Chinese moved in to support the other side in order to prevent encirclement of their country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has created a dangerous situation, with a confrontation now between Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concerning Russia’s intervention in Africa, Russia has not caused any of the problems in Africa, neither has <span class="highlight">China</span>, nor Britain, although all these nations have exploited the problems which already exist when it has suited their purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problems of the people of Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, Africa and even the Middle East are being aided and abetted by the foreign ambitions of the bigger powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all there is South-East Asia where we are seeing a conflict between allegedly Marxist states- the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>; Socialist Vietnam and Democratic Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Soviet Union, which is certainly one of the two most powerful countries in the world, and <span class="highlight">China</span>, which is at the very least one of the half dozen most powerful countries of the world, are on the very edge of armed conflict with states with which they were allied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of <span class="highlight">China</span> it is the so-called Democratic Kampuchea and in the case of the Soviet Union it is Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all let us look at the situation in South East Asia and specifically Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the eviction of the Japanese from Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> in 1945, when the British troops moved in, the French were brought back but clearly they were not wanted by the local inhabitants and were evicted after the battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thousands upon thousands of people from our own country and the United States as well as from Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> died trying to preserve regimes which obviously could not last, whatever the morality of it may have been, and were bound to be destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Warring factions such as the supporters of Pol Pot, the supporters of Pham Van Dong and the supporters of the twice resuscitated First  Deputy  Premier of <span class="highlight">China</span> are brawling, fighting, murdering and bombing in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is scant, if any, respect for human rights in the Soviet Union, or in <span class="highlight">China</span>, or in Vietnam or in the previous and, I should imagine, present regimes in Cambodia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We often hear romantic stories about how wonderful it is in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was fortunate last year to visit Japan, <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Phillippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those visits were very interesting, particularly the visit to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I now turn to the problems which exist in <span class="highlight">China</span>, Russia and Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I visited <span class="highlight">China</span> I spoke to many Chinese officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not protecting <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether <span class="highlight">China</span>’s invasion of Vietnam would have taken place if the Soviets had not made a treaty with the people of Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The danger is that the fighting could escalate into a war in which <span class="highlight">China</span> poured such manpower and resources into Vietnam that the Vietnamese would at last bring forward- I do not believe that they have done so yet- their crack troops to fight the Chinese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was discussing the fact that <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam are locked in battle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that the time could come when <span class="highlight">China</span> would find it most difficult to extricate itself from the position in which it has now placed itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> has endeavoured to woo Hungary away from the Soviet bloc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main effect, of course, is that it is a world contest between Russia and <span class="highlight">China</span> as to which country will be the supreme being within the communist world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  on important events throughout the world concentrated essentially on the recent developments in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, he did not review closely enough some of the mistakes that this Government has made with regard to this conflict, nor did he look sufficiently at the ramifications for the South East Asian region overall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Sino- Vietnam conflict has made the whole of the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> and South East Asia region far less stable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless there is a rapid conclusion, escalation of the conflict could well eventuate in a Soviet military strike against <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some commentators still have not ruled out the possibility of a fullscale conventional war between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it has acted quite moderately up to the moment but I have no doubt that there are some people in the Soviet armed forces who would like to encourage a pre-emptive strike against <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is also fortunate from this point of view that it is not in the interests of Vietnam to encourage a Soviet military strike against <span class="highlight">China</span> since the Chinese would then be forced to take rapid strike action against Vietnam in order to neutralise their southern flank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember reading Harrison Salisbury’s book in 1969 on the inevitability of a war between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My essential criticism of the Australian Government’s current approach to Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> is that we have allowed ourselves to be seen as taking a pro-Chinese stance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister,  Mr Fraser,  was muted in his criticism yesterday of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s attack on Vietnam, claiming that it was a direct result of Vietnam’s earlier invasion of Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the same Malcolm Fraser was such a staunch critic of Gough Whitlam ‘s <span class="highlight">China</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Whitlam,  has ignored <span class="highlight">China</span>’s support for revolutionary warfare, he has ignored the fact <span class="highlight">China</span> is building strategic military roads in Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then the other day we had the  Deputy  Prime Minister and Leader of the National Country Party,  Mr Anthony,  describing as ‘louts’ the unionists who were blocking wheat shipments to <span class="highlight">China</span> in opposition to its invasion of Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that if that action had been taken a few years ago he probably would have been recommending that medals be struck and given to the people that were stopping ships that were going to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is to be this continual disruption and discrimination against <span class="highlight">China</span>, because somebody  doesn ‘t  like its involvement in the Vietnam war, all I can say is that those people are doing great harm to a great Australian industry, to the nation as a whole and to our relationship with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Lin  Ping made it clear in an interview on television by the Australian Broadcasting Commission that he interpreted  Mr Fraser  ‘s statement as being sympathetic to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst it is fairly obvious that the Chinese are a greater potential source of trade for Australia and that it may be of benefit to Australia to share <span class="highlight">China</span>’s attitute in regard to the demilitarisation of the Indian Ocean and a reduction of super power activity in Asia it does not justify, either on moral grounds or strategic grounds, Australia’s unqualified support for <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our thinly-veiled support for one of the combatants in the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> conflict at the moment is certainly not in Australia’s long term interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly, that is the very real problem the world faces in the difficulty in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, Australia’s application of its principles in the last few weeks has been to make clear in the various councils of the world its position as to the withdrawal of forces in the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> war from Vietnam as well as from Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, some Opposition senators take the simplistic view that because there is a capacity for Australia to say that we require peace and stability in South East Asia, and because that view happens to coincide with the views of <span class="highlight">China</span> but apparently does not coincide with the views of Vietnam, we are somehow showing bias towards <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that one can regard oneself as an instant expert on foreign affairs because one has travelled recently to both <span class="highlight">China</span> and Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly, the impression I gained of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s position in the world today was one not only of a fear of Russia but also of the very real concern that its national position is at risk visavis the Russian situation on its immediate northern borders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly, <span class="highlight">China</span> faces very grave difficulties in its industrial area in the immediate north-eastern region north of the Yalu River. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A very well-timed and organised force could cut that region off from the rest of <span class="highlight">China</span> and so make a quite considerable impact on <span class="highlight">China</span>’s capacity to fight a war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That could be attained through a very quick and relatively easy strike, but might of course risk the return of nuclear weapons on the part of <span class="highlight">China</span> if such an attempt were made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the heartland of <span class="highlight">China</span>, the rice area, is exposed on the south to Vietnam, which has been making incursions across the Chinese border in recent times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That situation is quite apart from the ring of 44 divisions of Soviet troops all the way round the <span class="highlight">China</span> border. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turning to the Kampuchean situation there is no doubt in my mind that <span class="highlight">China</span>’s strike in regard to Vietnam stems directly from a challenge to its interests, as it perceives them, by Vietnam’s invasion of Cambodia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The practical situation in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> is a very dangerous one for the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find that the statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs as clearly as possible calls.upon both Vietnam and <span class="highlight">China</span> in their present conflict to withdraw their forces from the countries which they are presently occupying and to return to the establishment of peace and stability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not prepared to stand here and defend <span class="highlight">China</span>’s invasion of Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Vietnamese attack on Kampuchea was an attack by a client of the Soviet Union on a client of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever its motivation the attack bore directly on the rivalry and competition between the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span> for long term influence in the region . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have called on Vietnam to withdraw its forces from Kampuchea, on <span class="highlight">China</span> to withdraw its forces from Vietnam and on the Soviet Union to exercise restraint to prevent the last turn of the screw, which could be disastrous not merely for the region but for the peace of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that there is any person in the world who does not want to live in peaceful and stable surroundings, regardless of whether he lives in <span class="highlight">China</span>, the Soviet Union, America, Australia or somewhere in the Middle East. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s speech was made against the background of certain very serious and important events in the Middle East and South East Asia, in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its geographical situation is such that it is flanked on the eastern side by the Pacific Ocean and developing, independent island state nations and on the western side by the Indian Ocean with all the international implications that exist there, and to its north has the troubled area of South East Asia and Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have become aware of the implications of the Vietnam invasion of Cambodia or Kampuchea and now, of course, as we very well know, the conflict between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To reflect on what I mentioned earlier, I point out that these conflicts were created by the power rivalry that exists between four major states adjacent to the areas, namely, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Vietnam and Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conflict in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> is, of course, the greatest cause of concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of concern; it is a matter of disappointment to those governments in the area and in other parts of the world which over recent years have lent their support, interest and attention to matters relating to the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> area and which hoped that the steps which had been taken might have contributed to the stability and a settling down of the situation in the South East Asian area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of conversations with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees the two Ministers announced that Australia would contribute about $3m to assist in the overall refugee situation, but particularly in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite what is happening in Vietnam and despite the argument between the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span>, we still have an acceptance by the United States and the Soviet Union that detente ought to be achieved and that the SALT discussions ought to be concluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Minister talked about the way to solve the <span class="highlight">China</span>- Vietnam situation he made it almost a pre-condition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam therefore is not likely to be resolved with any element of permanence by a settlement on the Vietnam-<span class="highlight">China</span> border which leaves the situation in Kampuchea unchanged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, that is a fairly positive and firm statement that in the opinion of this Government the situation in Kampuchea, which was first destroyed by military operations, must be permanently connected with the <span class="highlight">China</span> border incident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement goes further than the situation we are talking about- the issue of <span class="highlight">China</span> versus Vietnam, with Soviet Union on the fringes- and talks about the situation in Iran. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to  Mr Whitlam  we had always been challenged at election time by the red threat from <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many times did they say the real threat was <span class="highlight">China</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many times did they influence the Australian electorate that this was the cause of the whole trouble and to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span> as we were the first to do, was a wrong decision? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rather unusual to find that a government which resisted in the first instance the recognition of Red <span class="highlight">China</span> now accuses the Opposition of not being critical and sensible about the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, the Foreign Minister today referred to statements in 1975 in which he foresaw the possibility that Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> might become the scene for a Sino-Soviet conflict to be played out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That statement, which was made in October 1975, reflected considerable foresight about what might happen, and indeed has happened, in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has made a very important reference in his statement to the restraint that has been exercised by the Soviet Union in the current crisis in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, it is not hard to see that the Soviet Union might feel that Europe, Japan, the United States of America, and <span class="highlight">China</span> are in fact in many ways aligned against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we have to be careful about that sort of development if we expect the Soviet Union to continue to exercise the sort of restraint it has exercised so far in the conflict in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I only add that in the context of the tendency towards alignment between Europe, Japan, the United States of America and <span class="highlight">China</span>, Australia obviously falls into that group along with members of the Association of South East Asian Nations and the countries of the South Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take it that  Senator Wriedt  is raising the question of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s punitive action against Vietnam because of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s claim that certain action has taken place on its southern border; and as well, Vietnam’s invasion of Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has made it clear that in fact <span class="highlight">China</span> should withdraw its forces from the northern provinces of Vietnam and that Vietnam should withdraw its troops from Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, concerns the <span class="highlight">China</span>- Vietnam war and the Australian Government’s intelligence assessments as reported in yesterday’s newspapers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Government present such intelligence assessments and media briefs to this Parliament and in particular give clarification of the contents of Chinese communications with Australia and other countries as to <span class="highlight">China</span>’s intentions and goals? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another criticism that I wish to make of the statement and, indeed, of many of the speeches of Government members is that I have detected a pro-<span class="highlight">China</span> bias and an anti-Soviet bias. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator might dispute that there has been a pro- <span class="highlight">China</span> bias or an anti-Russia bias, but he cannot dispute that I have detected it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether that is the reason that this pro-<span class="highlight">China</span> bias is apparent in the statement by the Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick)  and in the speeches made by Government senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose one could argue that if we see <span class="highlight">China</span> as a potential massive trading partner of the future, which it is- if the supporters of one’s party see <span class="highlight">China</span> in that light- there might be a philosophy of let us not be nasty to <span class="highlight">China</span> because it might affect our trade negotiations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I mention <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that  Senator Kilgariff  made an excellent speech on <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator has been to <span class="highlight">China</span> and he confirmed the views that I have had expressed to me by travellers to that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr John  Siddons, a most distinguished Australian and the National  President  of my party, recently visited <span class="highlight">China</span> with a group of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was fortunate in having as his travelling companion  Mr Ross  Tyrell, another most distinguished Australian who I think is regarded internationally as in the third top group of <span class="highlight">China</span> experts in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not say, nor do any experts say, that there is any evidence that Russia will invade <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that every Chinese person sincerely believes that Russia will attack <span class="highlight">China</span> and will attack from that country’s soft underbelly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>History has shown that the invasion of <span class="highlight">China</span> from the north, the north-west and the west is difficult because of the problems presented by Mongolia and the Himalayas and with respect to logistical support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But invasion is a possibility with the help of friendly allies through <span class="highlight">China</span>’s underbelly- that is, up through Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not forget another philosophy that has been in <span class="highlight">China</span> for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One reads in Chinese literature and hears from Chinese diplomats- and this is in line with the Maoist theory- that even in the event of a nuclear war <span class="highlight">China</span> would kill 200 million of the 230 million Russians and Russia would kill 200 million Chinese but <span class="highlight">China</span> would still have 800 million people left. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that we should not play to Russia’s paranoid fears- and that nation has the same fears of paranoia as does <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want to have good relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>, by all means let us go out to have them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let us not chase good relations with <span class="highlight">China</span> at the expense of unnecessarily offending the other great paranoid power in the world, namely, the Soviets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence  (Mr Killen)  and the Minister for Foreign Affairs that if in an attempt to ingratiate themselves with <span class="highlight">China</span> they offend or play to the paranoia or the fear that is in the Russian mind they will do a great disservice to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the next 25 years at least the West set about the isolation of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> in exactly the same way as the West had treated the emergence of the state known as the USSR. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the conditions of fear were created, and <span class="highlight">China</span> was driven into a thinking which I think is part of the underlying cause of the problem we are dealing with today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all remember, of course, the statements made by the members of this Government, and the Prime Minister in particular, about <span class="highlight">China</span> and about the war in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told that it was to be the hordes of <span class="highlight">China</span> who would come down through the IndoChina peninsula and invade this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have yet to hear a member of the conservative parties in this country acknowledge the grievous mistake that they made, that in fact they are the ones who can be termed to be the guilty ones in respect of the conflict that is taking place in the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> peninsula today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to touch on what  Senator Chipp  said because I agree with him, as you do,  Mr Deputy President,  about the tragic events in Timor; but I want to deal with the problems in the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> peninsula as we see them at this point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That ignores the issues that I have canvassed and the historical developments in the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> peninsula which go back into history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We call on Vietnam to withdraw its forces from Kampuchea and on <span class="highlight">China</span> to withdraw its forces from Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The wars which have engulfed the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> States over the past thirty years have brought untold human suffering and misery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They mean precisely nothing and, of course, the document makes no reference to our areas of responsibility, whether we in fact contributed or the Western powers contributed to the dilemma, the problems and the disaster that now face the people in the Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> peninsula. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conflicts reflect and were created by the hostility and rivalry existing among four states: the Soviet Union, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Vietnam and Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst there are certain differences in emphasis between the major communist powers, <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union, they are not the underlying causes of the present conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, we refused to recognise <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We refused to understand <span class="highlight">China</span>, but all of a sudden, in pursuance of this anti-Sovietism, to which  Senator Chipp  referred, we seem to be adopting a pro-<span class="highlight">China</span>, anti-Soviet position as if that were the only issue that ought to be considered in respect of the problem concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent months the Iraqi Government has been spending a lot of its time beheading its pro-Soviet leaders but despite that, despite <span class="highlight">China</span>, despite Rumania, despite Yugoslavia, we now suppose that Iran, Ethiopia, Angola and Afghanistan are permanent creatures of Soviet policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We contributed, as part of the West, to the isolation of <span class="highlight">China</span> and we contributed to the problems in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was an opportunity to create an Asian Yugoslavia, an independent country, following its own social path of development, but making its decisions of selfdetermination and not being pan of the <span class="highlight">China</span> bloc, which the Liberal-National Country Parties said was the cause of the war in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> agreed to contribute $300m, but unfortunately, as the events show, that was cancelled at the end of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A few months later, by the spring of 1977, it had become evident that Hanoi was bent on improving relations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We propose that the independence and sovereignty of Kampuchea be guaranteed by international agreement and that the Kampuchean people be left to resolve their internal problems free of interference from Vietnam, <span class="highlight">China</span> or any other outside forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We support the Vietnamese Government’s proposals for the resolution of all Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> border disputes by internationally supervised negotiations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the figures supplied to me by the Research Service of the Parliamentary Library, during the so-called liberation war between North Vietnam and South Vietnam <span class="highlight">China</span> helped the North Vietnamese by giving them $20,000m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that an Australian communist said once: Between the Elbe River and the <span class="highlight">China</span> Sea no man points a gun at another’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now we have the USSR against <span class="highlight">China</span>; <span class="highlight">China</span> against Vietnam; Yugoslavian troops on the Bulgarian border; African countries with Soviet-type dictatorships fighting each other; and Ethopia fighting Somalia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As somebody said- I think he put it quite nicely- from Algeria to Tanzania, from <span class="highlight">China</span> to Canada, the national inspiration and the need to embody the culture in a national estate and a national society are still with us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been often observed that relations between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam have traditionally been characterised by enmity . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Traditional Vietnamese-Cambodian enmity seems even more intense, at least on the Cambodian side, than that between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conflicts reflect and were created by the hostility and rivalry existing between four states: The Soviet Union, <span class="highlight">China</span>, Vietnam and Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We get all worked up about this issue, but the fact is that after <span class="highlight">China</span> exercised its rights over a boundary dispute with India it retreated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union came into this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to me the lesson was this: As far as the Western powers- we could call them that or a loose alliance of the ANZUS powers- are concerned, if we look at it strictly on percentage lines, we are no better off than we would have been if we had not worried about the futile war in Vietnam because by now the ideological rivalries between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union concerning the land mass of Asia, in particular South Vietnam, would have been apparent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major issue- the present conflict between Vietnam and <span class="highlight">China</span>- has had a pretty fair hammering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me the question is not whether the United States, the Soviet Union or <span class="highlight">China</span> are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a  National Times  article March 6-11,1978, stated: Australia is to play a much more significant role in the strategic weapons plan of the United States, the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will place Australia in the front line of any nuclear exchange between the US and either the Soviet Union or <span class="highlight">China</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seemed to me to be the height of hypocrisy for Government members to show now so much respect for a delegation from <span class="highlight">China</span> when some six years ago they were the greatest spokesmen against <span class="highlight">China</span> and made statements about the downward thrust of communism, with the force behind that downward thrust being <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, in the past, we criticised the United States for its position in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>, then surely we should be criticising today the position that <span class="highlight">China</span> takes against Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those criticisms which I levelled against the United States in adjournment debates early in the morning, I level now against <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia will be one of those expendable targets because it has upon its soil at the present time a number of United States bases which are aimed at monitoring the strength of the USSR and of the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are paranoic in their fear of an encirclement of their nation, of their people, by the United States of America, by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and all the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was an invasion, and Vietnam deserved a lesson which <span class="highlight">China</span> proceeded to teach it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was in Hanoi seven months ago and when I returned I said that the situation in Vietnam was serious; that there were 15 Chinese divisions massed on the northern border in order to reduce the pressure on Cambodia; that Vietnamese divisions were going north; and that <span class="highlight">China</span> had engaged in a psychological campaign against the Vietnamese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> suddenly withdrew aid from 500 projects in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did to the Vietnamese people what it accused the Soviet Union of doing to itself, which is at the basis of the conflict between the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the sudden withdrawal of aid by the Soviet Union from <span class="highlight">China</span> at a crucial time in <span class="highlight">China</span>’s development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> did to Vietnam exactly what it accused the Soviet Union of doing to itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Many of this merchant class in the South were Chinese who had fled from the revolution in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some went to Taiwan while others went to Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The claim by <span class="highlight">China</span> that Chinese nationals were being persecuted arose from this incident and it seems to me peculiar that <span class="highlight">China</span> should accuse Vietnam of something which it did itself after the revolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is surprising to me that <span class="highlight">China</span> should come to the defence of Chinese merchants in Ho Chi Minh City who were refugees from the regime in <span class="highlight">China</span> and who subsequently, when they left Vietnam, went not back to <span class="highlight">China</span> but to France and, as most of them did, to Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the ships that came from <span class="highlight">China</span> to pick up refugees anchored outside Haiphong, the only condition that the Vietnamese people put on the refugees leaving was that it should be done in the normal way; that lists should be given to the Vietnamese authorities of people wishing to go; that the Chinese ships could take only three days for the whole of the operation; and that they should enter only two pons, Haiphong and Ho Chi Minh City. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My belief is that <span class="highlight">China</span> manufactured a case against Vietnam in order to invade Vietnam and to teach it a lesson because it felt that Vietnam was very much a pan of the Soviet system and part of the Soviet sphere of influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because it was not allowed by <span class="highlight">China</span> to do this, <span class="highlight">China</span> subsequently was able to use this to justify its invasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government has evidenced by its reception of the Chinese delegation here tonight and the subservience it is now showing to <span class="highlight">China</span> that it is taking part in a dangerous exercise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the United States also is engaged in the same dangerous exercise of encouraging <span class="highlight">China</span> and is taking sides against the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it was quite wrong of the Australian Government to have received the delegation from <span class="highlight">China</span> at a time when <span class="highlight">China</span> was engaged in an act of aggression, irrespective of how the Australian Government may have viewed the Vietnamese incursion into Cambodia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some reason we now seem to think it is to our advantage that <span class="highlight">China</span> is strongly opposed to the Soviet Union, as a result of which we believe we may be able to engage in some further trade negotiations with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because we have this belief we take a very short-sighted position and support <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This shock leads to a disturbed state of mind when contemplating a conflict between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many of us remember that upon his return from Vietnam he expressed a very real concern at the dangers of a conflict between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last November I was in Vancouver at the Congress of the Socialist International where the possibility of conflict between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam and between the USSR and <span class="highlight">China</span> was commonly brought up in speeches, around dining tables and in conversation outside the congress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am very concerned indeed about our Government’s credibility abroad when we consider the double standards that have been applied to the situation in East Timor and to the situation in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear that the Government is making excuses for <span class="highlight">China</span> and has decided that it is far easier to withdraw aid than to abandon trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It therefore seems to be taking sides with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That will leave about 45,000 tonnes to be spread around fairly thin markets in the Middle East, Africa, the Caribbean and South-east Asia, with perhaps some sales to the Soviet Union and <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The story went on to recount how for 20 weeks a 1 7- year-old Vietnamese girl refugee marooned on an old wreck in the South <span class="highlight">China</span> Sea lived on seagulls, oysters and a little rainwater and that when help finally came the girl had buried the last of her 49 companions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one talks about the Bay of Pigssince the honourable senator prompts me to digress- it is important to remember that of all the criticisms that were made of the Central Intelligence Agency about that incident and its assessment in relation to <span class="highlight">China</span>’s involvement in Vietnam, were throughout correct- much more correct than were the assessments made by this Government or its predecessors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It places Australia in exactly the same category in which <span class="highlight">China</span> placed itself when it withdrew substantial aid from Vietnam at a time when Vietnam was endeavouring to reconstruct its economy and achieve a position of independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By withdrawing this aid after the withdrawal by <span class="highlight">China</span> of its aid to Vietnam, we have succeeded in thrusting Vietnam into an economic area very much under the influence of the Soviet or Eastern European bloc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, the third body that attracts  Mr Justice  Hope’s explicit attention, at page 48 of the report in question, is the CPA(M/L), the <span class="highlight">China</span>-line communist party which recently, of course, found itself split into two rather bitterly-opposed factions, with its barely 1,000 members divided between those who pledge undying loyalty to the Gang of Four and the Cultural Revolution and those- the larger group- who support the current more pragmatically-inclined Chinese leadership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for National Development aware of a report in a recent producers’ journal which says, inter alia, that because of the availability of oil from <span class="highlight">China</span> and Mexico, Australia need not be unduly concerned about potential shortfalls in oil supplies from Iran? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790503_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The economic situation in Vietnam is so desperate, because of a variety of climatic conditions, and because of the withdraw by the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> of many millions of dollars in economic aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only did <span class="highlight">China</span> bring aid to an end, but also the United States of America did not keep the promise given by  President  Nixon of substantial reconstruction aid for Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One major power is the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, which has withdrawn aid, possibly because of Vietnam ‘s dependence on the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I too was in Vietnam in the middle of last year and I saw at first hand the desperate problems which Vietnam faced in seeking to carry out reconstruction programs while still under pressure from Kampuchea and <span class="highlight">China</span> on its borders, pressures which were being applied in order to wrench Vietnam away from the influence of the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Hoa people were told distinctly that there would be trouble between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam over Kampuchea and that they were to realise that if they stayed in Vietnam they were likely to be disadvantaged because of the struggle, because <span class="highlight">China</span> would be on the side of Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this pressure from <span class="highlight">China</span>, because of the conflict between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam, which is really a conflict between <span class="highlight">China</span> and the Soviet Union, many hundreds and thousands of people of Chinese origin began to leave Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is very interesting indeed to notice that one of the other front runners in the stakes of national liberation, the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span>, has so far been studiously silent on this issue; studiously silent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would make a suggestion to you as to why the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> has remained silent about this, and that is because it is more clearly able to foresee the international implications of what is happening there than the Iron Lady of Downing Street,  Mr Fraser  and  Mr Eggleton. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Speaking as one who has seen the work of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs on the refugee island of Bidong in the South <span class="highlight">China</span> Sea, can the Minister indicate whether departmental officers have any specific instructions relating to the family distribution situation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the understanding of the Government that the recently signed agreement between the United States and <span class="highlight">China</span> for the hydroelectric work does not preclude the possibility of services of other companies, such as the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, being also used in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> has an enormous potential for development in the hyrdo-electric field and a number of countries, in addition to the United States, are interested in offering assistance to <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some time now the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, realising the potential for work in <span class="highlight">China</span> specifically in the hyrdo-electric field, has been preparing a submission detailing the Corporation’s experience and capabilities in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Present indications are that the submission from the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation will be closely studied by the Chinese and it is hoped that an invitation will be issued for the Director of the Corporation to visit <span class="highlight">China</span> to progress the matter of actual commissions for work in the hydro-electric field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that although the tragedy which is now being played out in the South <span class="highlight">China</span> Sea is disturbing the complacency of many Australian people, there is no need for us to be unduly frightened of it; rather I think we are being challenged to face a reality that has always been there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All of them formed part of that great company of people who survived the journey across the South <span class="highlight">China</span> Sea and were placed on the island of Bidong, where they were being looked after in an administrative capacity by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and agencies in Malyasia and Kuala Lumpur, such as the Red Crescent organisation, which was carrying out the distribution of food and medical supplies and, indeed, was carrying out an enormous amount’ of detailed work in relation to correspondence and the distribution of the refugees to enable families to stay together if at all possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, it is likely that because the SALT II negotiations were in an advanced and critical stage early this year, both the super-powers acted with restraint when confronted with the conflict between <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us look at our own region, and as an example, look at the situation in Indo-<span class="highlight">China</span> today and the massive increase in weapons into Vietnam, where it is estimated that the Soviet Union has supported Vietnam militarily by approximately 100,000 tonnes of military aid this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask the  Deputy  Leader of the Government in the Senate whether he has seen reports that now even <span class="highlight">China</span> and some other major trading countries are doing extensive research into the extraction of uranium from the sea because, as has been stated, an independent and secured uranium supply, even from exotic and expensive sources, is to be preferred to reasonably priced but uncertain supplies of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Soviet initiative in placing on the agenda of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly an item entitled the ‘inadmissibility of the policy of hegemonism in international relations’ cannot be seen by Australia as anything but a propaganda activity related to the rivalry with <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister noted a growing volume of reports of a new repression of political dissent in the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> such that, for example, the free expression of criticism of party leadership via the so-called Democracy Wall is fraught with danger? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further, as much of the political structure and activity within the People’s Republic of <span class="highlight">China</span> is obscure, can the Minister arrange a comprehensive seminar for honourable senators to enable us to obtain an understanding of that nation which is so important to our political and trading future? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I and a number of people have been trying to build up trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> and many other countries yet in this case we have virtually stolen a watch from a seaman who will have to work for three months to recover the cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What is the Australian Government’s assessment of the likelihood of <span class="highlight">China</span>’s again attacking Vietnam, possibly through Laos and Kampuchea? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the early weeks of this year the Australian Government accurately predicted the invasion by <span class="highlight">China</span> of Vietnam- the so-called first lesson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">China</span> has been threatening a second lesson with regard to the Vietnamese attack on the Pol Pot forces in Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government has made clear to both <span class="highlight">China</span> and Vietnam that it strongly supports the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with international principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has this happened in respect of large and small businesses, importing such items as: (a) pure wool pullovers from <span class="highlight">China</span>; (b) long sleeve cardigans from Philippines; (c) ladies’ knitted tops from Philippines; (d) ladies’ pullovers from Hong Kong; and (e) ladies’ cotton blouses from India. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to people holding passports not recognised by Australia the principal areas are <span class="highlight">China</span> (Taiwan Province) and Zimbabwe-Rhodesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-91">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 14 November 1979  Senator Tate  asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, a question without notice concerning political dissidents in <span class="highlight">China</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He asked whether the Government would make representations to the Chinese Government regarding their treatment and whether a  seminar on <span class="highlight">China</span> could be arranged for interested senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Tate’s suggestion of a comprehensive seminar on <span class="highlight">China</span> is commendable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of reports of another big contract to sell Australian iron and steel worth some $10m to <span class="highlight">China</span> which was won in the face of stiff competition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>If they are correct, does not this dispel the comments of the Australian Labor Party that Australian trade with <span class="highlight">China</span> has been influenced by politics? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></li>
