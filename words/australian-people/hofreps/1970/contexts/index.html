<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I think the answer to the first question asked of me would be this: The effect it would have, if any, would depend upon the support given to it by <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and by those who support it, such as he has described, who are members of the Communist Party, members of Communist Party fronts and a number of members of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only inform the honourable member that we have had no blandishments seeking to induce us to recognise Communist China and that the policy of this Government on that matter remains as it always has been and I am sure it is clearly understood to be by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sorry that 1 happened to introduce a note of politics for the honourable member for Cowper, for i know he is never political but I think that it is also important for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to realise that these things are happening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that 2.1% of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not have the facility of television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700605_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But 1 am sure the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would wish to make a gesture of sympathy to those who, in the last few weeks, have been the victims of these two natura! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure the honourable gentleman that this re-emergence of Stalinism or neoStalinism is regretted by us and, I believe, regretted by all of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700605_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister convey, through appropriate diplomatic channels, that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> deplore any government interference with the freedom of the Press, radio or television? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700605_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been accused of having, from the concrete jungles of Tasmania, wished upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a standard of poverty of Asiatic, I think the word was, dimensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand there is a group of students from Cambodia who have come to this country in order to let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know of what is happening in Cambodia and of the facts of the invasion of that country by North Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that opportunities will be taken by (he media to enable these representatives– these young student representatives - of a country under attack properly to put their point of view to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Prime Minister ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to compare the treatment of this visit with that which would surely have greeted such a group if (heir evidence had been anti-American or antiAustralian? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Prime Minister give an assurance to the House and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that he will now cease using the Communist bogey during any future election campaign, a bogey on which his and previous governments have relied so heavily to maintain them in power? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will also find out from the Acting Minister for Defence the extent to which <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can visit them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, what I am sure about is that the more the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> understand the action taken by members of the Australian Labor Party associated with the more extravagant sections of the Australian Council of Trade Unions who will do all in their power to obstruct the visit of sporting teams to Australia, the more the public will resent and be horrified at their actions and they will express their displeasure in the proper place, and that is in the polls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What concerns me is that today the Parliament is being asked for more money for defence purposes and yet the Government has not accounted to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to this House for $20m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this decision is to be made, is it not a reflection on the ability, integrity and capacity of officers of the Australian Broadcasting Commission not only to compete with their commercial competitors but to surpass them in this field of television programming in informing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with regard to very important issues? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had to raise charges to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to place further burdens upon them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first step is to set up an inquiry to involve the public in discussion on what is being proposed, and to subject to severe scrutiny and analysis any proposals put forward to determine their appropriateness and practicability for the Australian economy and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Federal Government take immediate steps to act on behalf of all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to preserve Lake Pedder in its natural state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Federal Government take immediate steps to act on behalf of all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to preserve Lake Pedder in its natural slate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great tragedy is that these new principles which have been enunciated by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  and supported by some of his colleagues could sacrifice the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and, in particular, <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray, that the Federal Government take immediate steps to act On behalf of all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to preserve Lake Pedder in its natural state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-1-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Federal Government take immediate steps to act on behalf of all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to preserve Lake Pedder in its natural state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister now give an assurance that the Government will speak up and act in accordance with the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, free of any inhibitions to the United States? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Government’s action in refusing to allow  Mr Ijaz  Hussain to remain in Australia is a denial of human rights and contrary to the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-0-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners humbly pray that the Federal Government and its leaders will institute all such measures as may be deemed necessary to prevent any takeover of this company until such time as the Federal Government is satisfied that the national interest of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is best served by such a takeover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I can say is that the lives and interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be placed on the highest possible level and we will take action if we think it is necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will these impact statements be public documents, as is the case in the United States of America, so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and organisations will have an opportunity to examine them before legislation is discussed by Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were fortunate that the Australian Labor Party was not in a position to control the rates of pension at the moment because the Australian Labor Party had promised to tie pensions to the consumer price index. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that does not detract from the fact that the land will become available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for their use and enjoyment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should an announcement be made by the Government of China that it intends to explode one or more nuclear devices, will the Government on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> immediately lodge with China and the United Nations the strongest possible protest against such a decision? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-40-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Opposition felt that this provision had some ulterior motive - that the Government was making a big splash to try to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it was really interested in takeovers but was providing that the legislation would operate for 12 months or less and then be repealed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the Prime Minister to his recent remarks when he said that he believed in open government and in keeping the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> informed of what goes on in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Prime Minister allow the length of question time to be doubled in order to provide that openness of government which he promised to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the honourable gentleman believe that inflation can to many people be just as damaging as a fire in a house, and will the honourable gentleman explain to the Parliament what intentions he has either personally or for the Government to take action to prevent the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> being brought to a stage of great discomfort and disadvantage to themselves by the incipient forces of inflation which his Government intends to allow? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust that the Committee will provide information to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is his failure to discuss with the States the proposed amendment of the Statute of Westminster because of his desire to achieve a unitary system of government within Australia without consulting either the States or the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When will the Prime Minister release to this House and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the results of the Cabinet’s decisions on this all-important subject? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal to increase the number of senators is simply a result of the decision by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> made in about 1967 not to break the nexus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this is a matter of very real and significant importance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government agree that ambulance services are vital and important in respect of the health of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Will the Minister for Services and Property introduce legislate similar to that operative in the United States to make it compulsory for all political parties to disclose the source of their funds so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can see for themselves how much foreign money is being poured into Liberal Party coffers so that it can sell this country out to overseas interests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That in the opinion of this House Australia’s national anthem should not be changed without a total vote of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on suggested alternative anthems, including ‘God Save the Queen’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am encouraged by the gallup poll results published in several newspapers today indicating that the great majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are behind efforts to limit overseas control and ownership of our industries’ and our resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out in the course of my remarks that on this important constitutional matter, which is of great moment to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, I did not think that an honourable member of such high standing as the honourable member for Henty would treat the matter with scant respect and as a joke and refuse to act in the important capacity of teller on a matter that could change the lives of many Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The serious inconvenience and disruption being caused to the lives of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by widespread shortages of goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On behalf of the great majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, producers and consumers represented in this Parliament by members of the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party of Australia, I move: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This indicates to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that this Government has long-ranging and far-reaching concern for the welfare of all sections of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have witnessed a very historic occasion where the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  has demonstrated his hitter annoyance and frustration that the national Parliament of Australia has 2 houses - an upper House and a lower House - and that he wants to bring about the downfall of the Senate so that there is complete power in one chamber so that he, the Prime Minister, can lord it over the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as well as this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want a corporation like the AIDC that is public property to have a share in those rich resources instead of seeing them being handed out by the Bjelke-Petersens and the Opposition in this House to one overseas corporation after another, in some cases for the receipt in exchange of a wide range of shares, such as has been issued to the members of the Government in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is time that this Government became honest with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it can, it should tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what it really intends to do through its scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a first principle, it should say how much the scheme will cost the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and what it will mean for their health welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before this debate is concluded, will the Minister for Social Security at least indicate for the first time what other legislative measures will be introduced which will be complementary to these 2 Bills concerning health which are being debated today, so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and this Parliament may know for the first time what other legislation is proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How can anybody in the community be asked to co-operate while there is this abysmal abandonment of responsibility by the Government and an abdication of any sense of responsibility to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Prime Minister’s visits overseas are of such value to him will he inform the House, recognising that he is answerable to the House and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for these visits? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the recent Government decision to conduct regular discussions with the European Economic Community on a range of issues of common interest, including the export of Australian mineral and energy resources, assist him in framing a comprehensive minerals and energy policy which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been awaiting for some 19 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-44-10">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the growing concern of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the rising rate of inflation, does the Prime Minister agree with the attitude and course of action of the Treasurer and is that the Government’s approach, or does the Prime Minister have a contrary view? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Speaker  of this House will be satisfying to himself, of some credit to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in general and certainly of some advantage to this place, the Parliament of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the public interest in these matters and the fact that the national Parliament ought to be able to legislate in this area will the Attorney-General urgently consider a referendum so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can give this Parliament the powers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Australian Government studied the purpose of the levy; if so, does it intend to emulate the action already taken by other bauxite-producing countries, of compelling the multinational corporations, which now share a joint monopoly over alumina and aluminium production, to make a greater financial contribution to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for the benefits they derive from their exclusive rights to exploit Australian bauxite resources? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-41-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further they have been misleading in a critical area, namely, the true alternatives facing the Arbitration Commission and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the crucial area of the indexation of incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#subdebate-13-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That this House expresses its want of confidence in the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  for deceiving the House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about his policy on East Timor and for misleading the House on 3 1 March about his meeting at Bali in September 1975 with senior Indonesian officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until they are implemented the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are in for a very tight time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 also observed a similar reaction from <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> during Her Majesty’s visit here earlier this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-42-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All Australians have guilt on their hands through the lack of moral commitment by governments and by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I place on record that I believe the majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want non-compulsory unionism, they do not want to see a compulsory theft of their funds for political parties and they want the abolition of preference clauses in awards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because of  Mr Horta  ‘s close association with so many displaced Timorese in this country, and the lack of recognition by a majority of the nations of the world of Indonesia’s military take-over of East Timor, do circumstances exist for  Mr Horta  being permitted to enter Australia so that he may make contact with his own people and put the other side of the picture to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: When can the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> expect a reduction of up to 2 per cent in interest rates on borrowings from building societies, and through bank overdrafts, as was suggested by him in his electorate talk of 27 November 1977, and at a Press conference in Lauceston on the same day? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister’s extravagance and self indulgence with public funds at a time when his own Government is causing grave financial hardship to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780816_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I compare the Honourable E. G. Whitlam with such mighty Prime Ministers as John Curtin, the Labor Prime Minister who led Australia during the period of the last World War, and Joseph Benedict Chifley who was revered by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but who was roundly criticised by the Press during the period that he was Prime Minister of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780816_reps_31_hor110/#debate-70">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The questions that were directed at the Prime Minister by the honourable member for Chifley, it seems to me as just a humble, ordinary member of this Parliament representing some 69,000 <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is not a battle that we want; but, unless we see some positive action and some unequivocal statement by the Fraser Government which declares the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and which assures the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the reef will never be at risk, I am afraid the battle will begin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is clear from the economic surveys conducted in Australia by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which were published in August that the Australian community, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian economy will benefit from this Budget, and that we are once again on the road to recovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can assure my honourable friend that the undertaking of surveillance patrols, the maintenance of sovereignty visits and all the attendant problems that are reasonably related to patrol activities are very much under review, and 1 can also assure him that I and the Government are endeavouring to see that there is a consciousness in the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as to how effectively and how vigorously these patrol activities are carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700303_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In order that the views of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can be obtained, will the Government authorise a referendum asking the following questions: 1, Are you in favour of State parliaments being retained in their present form? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700303_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the honourable gentleman that during the Christmas period the Post Office leased some twenty-four channels on the satellite system between Sydney and Perth so that Western <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would not be disadvantaged because the microwave system had not been completed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700303_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he act to retain for and restore to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> full control of and benefit from all areas in Bass Strait in excess of those necessary to yield  a  reasonable return to current developers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700303_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is well known to the House, and I believe it is well known to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that the North Vietnamese, assisted by the Communist Pathet Lao, have re-occupied the Plain of Jars and have pressed westward to Muong Soui after capturing Xieng Khouang, the airfield. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700304_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is now nearly 3 years since this Government was given the green light by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to get on with the job of lifting the Aboriginals out of the mire of despondency and degradation that they had wallowed in since the arrival of Captain Cook, almost 200 years ago to the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are asked to forget that most of this increase will have been procured by a conscription which has never been justified to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as something necessary and inevitable, much less desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I challenge them to join in the demand for a re-examination of the constitutional structure and the presentation of proposals to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to alter it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the knowledge I have now I believe that the only crime Burchett has committed in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and of the world is the crime of telling the truth, if it is a crime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, bis passion seems to be aroused mainly on questions that affect people like Wilfred Burchett, the Cuban issue and other issues that seem to relate, perhaps unintentionally, to people who, in my opinion and 1 think in the opinion of a large number of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, are not necessarily friends of Australia or the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When 200 or 300 people gather together to protest, that does not mean that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not with me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt the honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Beazley)  will give to me some of his high thoughts, but I would suggest to him to go out into the market place and ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what they feel about Wilfred Burchett and his rights within Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is only one valid principle to govern the allocation of government resources - Federal or State - and that is the satisfaction of the real requirements of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, from adequate defence to day nurseries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a group should go into this whole question of Federal-State relations so that the question is not debated behind closed doors by Premiers who then go off and tell various stories to the Press but so that the whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> may know what the facts are, what the issues are, what the taxation powers are and what particular taxation powers are necessary for the control of the economy, and what is a fair principle for the division of taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other point I would like to make is this: I think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were tired of the situation that existed for so many years in relation to Aboriginal policy when the States contended that the Commonwealth had the money and the Commonwealth contended that it did not have the necessary constitutional power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now I believe the Commonwealth has the resources to attack this problem and it now has the constitutional power, since the prohibition on it was removed by the greatest majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in history in the referendum of May 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The courage that they say it takes to fight in Vietnam can be exemplified in a smaller way in this Parliament by voting with the only Party that can do anything for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and put an end to the Vietnam war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite clear that after 7 years the Government has decided that it can no longer fool itself or the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has deliberately betrayed the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and it is devoid of all moral worth and is totally unfit to occupy the Government benches in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that it will work as well in the future as it did in the past, but I doubt it very much indeed when I hear the honourable member for Reid and possibly the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant)  and some others whose outlooks on foreign affairs 1 do not necessarily think are for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will the right honourable gentleman endeavour to persuade  Senator Keeffe  to announce publicly the names of the Federal parliamentarians whom he claims to be involved, as I feel that his statement casts a distinct slur on the integrity of every member of this Federal Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This has become an issue in which one of the members of the front bench of the Opposition has issued a call - a clarion call he would like to think it - to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and particularly to those in Victoria and in Melbourne, to cease work, to occupy the streets and to occupy public buildings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the widespread concern being expressed by all sections of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about the threatened further increase in the price of petrol, will the Prime Minister make an immediate review of legislation and policy factors which would make the increase possible? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have stated on many previous occasions and emphasise again now, the Government strongly supports the common fee concept primarily because we earnestly desire to provide the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with a substantial degree of security against the cost of medical treatment The Government is also cognizant of the desirability of conducting the health benefits plan in such a way that the standards of medical practice and the legitimate interests of the medical profession are effectively safeguarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Minister says: ‘the right of dissent designed to change the law and Government policy’, he is saying exactly what we are saying when we state: ‘the right of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to express opposition to the war in Vietnam, as do the great majority of governments and peoples in the world’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I maintain, and will continue to maintain, that the system that we have at present is so good that anybody who would look to the Socialist health schemes of England and Canada as a means of improving it just does not understand the interpretation of the individualistic spirit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition some 30% of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not own their own homes, lt is not a question of their not owning their own homes as a matter of deliberate choice or of their lacking the incentive of thrift and providence - qualities that the Liberals are accustomed to waxing rhetorical and eloquent about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, he implied that no associations exist between members of the Australian Labor Party and Communists; secondly that there is no danger to Australia from China; and thirdly that the Liberals unfairly scare the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>.I think that is a fair summation of 3 points implicit in the honourable gentleman’s speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I feel certain that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will continue to be happy to provide grants in aid to Papua and New Guinea for many years to come on a scale comparable to our present efforts, but I do believe that it is in the interests of the people of Papua and New Guinea and the people of Australia that the moves towards, firstly, internal selfgovernment and, later, political independence should be accelerated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> knew that the scheme then operating was no good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The National Health Bill takes no account of the whale question of the health of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As 1 said at the outset, 1 expected to be speaking not at 8 o’clock tonight but rather after 9.30 and I was caught a little unprepared but I am quite sure that other members of the Government team who will follow me in this debate will ably refute the socialistic views propounded by the Opposition, and that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will realise fully that if the Labor Party had won at the last election not only would the people of Queensland have been deprived of a free hospital scheme but the people of Australia would have gone 10 steps backwards in the medical treatment that would have been handed out to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Government has done has been to patch up an occasional crack and chink here and there, lt has done this because it knows that the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - as proven by the gallup polls - favour Labor’s scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill sets out to help the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> obtain the benefits that are available today from the new techniques developed by the profession not only in Australia but all over the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite should hang their heads in shame for having denied to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> free hospitalisation, which is their right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whichever scheme suits the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and provides the coverage they need in time of sickness is acceptable to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he protest on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the  President  of the United States of America against the slaughter of 4 students at Kent University, Ohio, by National Guardsmen while the students were exercising their democratic right to dissent from American policy in Cambodia and Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not calculated to achieve anything except a weakening of the resolution of the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to secure a just peace in South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We, as the members of the Federal Parliamentary Liberal and Country Parties, urge the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to recognise: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An attempt is being made all the time to line up the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into intransigent camps beyond change or amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I not only believe them to be false, however, but I go even further and say that they have been fraudulently made and documented and sold to tens of thousands of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in publications which all too often bear the imprimatur of leading clergymen, parliamentarians, professors, professional men and others who ought to occupy positions of responsibility and trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no further time for an analysis of that hoax on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, but let me quote 1 further classic case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he fails to give unequivocal assurances on behalf of his Party and that section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> it represents, if he appears to hedge on this matter, to be confused, to be woolly, he will gravely contribute to the uncertainty about Australia’s future role which does exist and which my colleagues and I did our best to allay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was his forum to speak to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about this great issue that so concerns the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must be made aware of these things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I again repeat that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must come to know of this pernicious association with the Labor Party in this Parliament and of the influence that the Labor Party seeks to bring upon this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is designed to alter the policies that have been supported in election after election by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, lt also indicates a lack of concern and a lack of willingness by the Australian Labor Party to accept the verdict of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is in Australia a full opportunity for citizens and for members of political parties to seek to change laws if they muster a majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in their support, but the Australian Labor Party through its long and sorry history in recent years has not been able to muster that majority support and therefore it resorts to the streets to try to achieve what it has not been able to achieve through the ballot box. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It said that the second world war was wrong until Russia was attacked and then it suddenly became a just war according to that section of the Australian Labor Party which gave the then Prime Minister, John Curtin, a great deal of trouble in maintaining the unity of his Party and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in support of the war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, they would have a duty to say so so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can know fairly where they stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the Government that stands before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and utters this type of tripe about Communists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be rightly sceptical whether the alleged economies promised from a government health insurance fund would ever eventuate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, the most recent gallup poll indicates the attitude of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on this issue of the withdrawal of Australian troops from Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Executive pays tribute to those in the community whose efforts are directed in  a  peaceful manner towards an awakening conscience and stirring compassion in the minds and hearts of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the tragic horror that is Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that regardless of the technicalities of gallup polls the hearts and minds of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are trending towards that end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the debates that have preceded the present debate we have applied ourselves to the consideration of questions concerning the nation’s health and the housing and education of our people, and in every regard, no matter what test one applies, this Government is found wanting, that it has let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he not realise that these demonstrations were very much the result of a conviction that the Government is contemptuous of the views of a substantial number of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And no-one has been more adamant in the House on the question of the Fill and its capability and in denying that there was an agreement in existence which would prevent the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from being able to reach a satisfactory solution to the problem than was the Minister for Defence when he was Minister for the Army. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless the Government makes some of its plans with the quality of life in mind, and not the figures of its export budgets, its balance of payments position and the figures contained in its loan interest papers, it will never achieve the confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will never convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it is concerned more about people than profits and more about people than production figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that a gallup poll taken about 18 months ago showed that an overwhelming majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> approved the change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party, in almost all of the speeches it has made over recent years, being in opposition has found itself appealing to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for votes and has encouraged, probably in the view that this would be the most successful political gesture of all, the development of what is a pacifist outlook. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is probably even more correct to say that Australia’s wildlife really belongs to all mankind and that it is held by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on trust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Later on I hope to deal with protective devices that assure the independence of this Corporation and protect the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from just what the honourable member for Chifley was talking about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Farrer has given the members of his Party who are consistently sniping at the Prime Minister and saying that they will bring him down the opportunity on a great matter of honour to stand in this Parliament with him today and bring down a Government that has forfeited the respect of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the respect of all State administrators in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to that he not only says so but he supports the charge by reading from the minutes of the conference which was held and he quoted the names of every State Minister for Mines - every one a Liberal - and every State Attorney-General in support of the fact that this Government stands condemned in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as one which will not support the views or the obligations which it enters into. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable members opposite and the people of Australia that this is the opportunity to defeat a Government that has forfeited the complete confidence of a lot of its own supporters and undoubtedly the overwhelming majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a person as significant as the former Minister for National Development  (Mr Fairbairn)  and other Ministers are in contradiction on a matter which relates to dealings between the Commonwealth and the States I believe the House should be dissolved and that this matter should be referred to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and this is why I support the censure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are faced with a complete contradiction in the versions concerning the bargain that was made, but behind all this is a state of tension on the Government side of the House which we believe must go to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Faced with the charges that have been made by the honourable member for Farrer and endorsed, to some extent anyway, by some of the Premiers, we believe that the whole matter should be resolved by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on the Opposition side, have been presented with the categorical charges of the former Minister for National Development and the reply of the Prime Minister, and bearing in mind how vitally important is the whole subject matter of this controversy over the mineral resources of the continental shelf, believe it is time that these matters were resolved to the satisfaction of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When there is a dispute between ex-Ministers and Ministers on vital questions of promises it is time that this was put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is only one way that this can be put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and that is by the defeat of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances these matters should be referred to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe there is a slot and a sound reason for the establishment of this Corporation, and that it is in the interest of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that this Bill should be passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we are setting up a Corporation and telling the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and members of this House that at least 15 Australian companies are being taken over by overseas investing companies or parent companies to the detriment of Australia itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the first initiatives taken by the Government under the leadership of  Sir Robert  Menzies was to wind up that section because the Government did not want the embarrassment of statistical information being made available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we also believe that the private trading banks have a vital part to play in the Australian banking system and the Australian economy; and there can be no doubt either that the great majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believe this too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His Part&gt;&gt; is a part of the Government which has failed the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that the Government in South Australia knows full well that this year’s Budget will not be very acceptable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is just not right to expect that the decisions which will affect the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole should be made entirely and solely by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But rarely are the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> told exactly what the need is and what has to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is prepared to say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>: ‘We need X qualified teachers if we are to give every young Australian child the full opportunuity to develop his innate potentiality’ and if it is prepared to argue this way for 3 years, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not object to an increase in taxation if there are no other means of raising revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It sometimes staggers me that members of the Government can adopt such an approach as he adopts to the people that it employs on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that is, the people referred to, usually contemptuously, as bureaucrats’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot bring forward plans that are in the general interest of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, lt is sometimes dictated to by minority groups and organisations and suddenly it has to change its policy in the middle of a season in an effort to get an industry out of the plight in which it finds itself, lt is unfortunately true that the tragic plight not only of the wheat industry hut also the wool industry and other primary industries stems from the false policies of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is demonstrably true that men are by their very nature creative beings who derive satisfaction from the willing performance of productive activities and there is no doubt that work on the Snowy Mountains scheme, by virtue of its national importance, by virtue of the magnitude of the tasks undertaken and by virtue of the inherent challenge to those in both higher and lower echelons, inspired the work force, just as their success inspired the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This clause of the Bill is merely further evidence of the Government’s determination to put the riches of our country at the mercy of foreign enterprise and comes as no surprise from the Liberal Party which sees any national effort, be it the Snowy Mountains Authority or the Australian Industry Development Corporation, as a threat to its friends who could not care less about the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only members of this Parliament but also the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole are concerned about the economics of this industry today because of its importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-42-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is relevant to the clause and terribly important to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, there is the image we give to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it can be categorised only as a triumph for common sense among the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> over the irresponsibility of the call that was made to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they were serious about the arguments they have put forward to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> time and time again, this is not the time to be withdrawing forces; it is the time to be introducing more forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Americans have come to realise it, and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have come to realise it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these 2 forces can be brought together then the television industry in Australia and the whole mass media of television will be something in which we can participate and of which we, as <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, can be proud. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  and the Treasurer  (Mr Bury)  worked on two very crude assumptions - that the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are inordinately greedy and inordinately stupid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 believe that the events of the last few days have shown that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are neither as selfish nor as foolish as the Gorton Government assumed; but let us put it to the real test; let us take this Budget and the Government which produced it to the people themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government believes, and I am quite sure that the great majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believes, that our national birth rate is insufficient to give us a population close to the optimum, whatever that figure may prove to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Just how far this Government has moved away from the needs and the aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can best be seen by looking at what has been happening recently concerning the joint report by the States and the Commonwealth on the needs of Australian education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When one considers the amount of money that is being spent on education and when one realises just how inadequate that expenditure is, one comes to the conclusion that the Government deserves the strongest condemnation for not being prepared to reveal to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the experts whose business is education just where we are heading in education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the exact arguments are and what the exact evidence is will be kept concealed from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, lt is equally deplorable that the State governments have been prepared to act in collusion with the Commonwealth Government in the suppression of this information, lt serves the State governments right, if they are at all sincere about education, that no action has been taken so far as a result of this survey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is purely and solely a matter which concerns only the department responsible for education in each State and only the government of each Stale, or is it something which concerns the interests and the welfare of the whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are given full details of what is in this survey of the needs of Australian education, I will continue to protest and the Australian Labor Party will continue to protest in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So there is great benefit to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because we have implemented in this first Budget the policy which the Prime Minister announced last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Within the last few years two other Labor leaders felt they were within an ace of victory but the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have not been hoodwinked by some of the catchcries and the irresponsible attitudes of those who back the ALP. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government, by taking the elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate out of tandem, involved the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in a cost of about $500,000 each 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But it will never sell itself to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as long as it performs like this because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are concerned with the affiliations which are undertaken by some sections of the honourable member’s Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Everyone, from one end of this country to another - from the country towns of the outback to the great cities of Australia has condemned this Government openly and through the Press for its complete failure to meet every need of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in this document which has been presented to us as a budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In addition to that, it promised that it would introduce into Australia by 1952 a superannuation scheme for endorsement by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, lt is 21 years since it came into power and we are still waiting for that scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So when there is a body such as this and an alternative government adopting the popular front technique not only to develop its policy but to formulate its policy and to organise around this policy, it would be recreant for any government or any parliamentarian to seek to hide these facts from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask this House today to debate this issue that the honourable member for Lilley has raised, to place the facts before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to let them know that these smearing and innuendo tactics have no place in our public life and that the type of legislation and restrictions that the Liberal Party would seek to force on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must be rejected and opposed by every democrat in the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were willing to apply unprecedented force and unparallelled violence in the name of the domino theory, but we baulked at its first real test - -righly and inevitably so, because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would no more tolerate a repeat performance of the Vietnam tragedy than the people of the United States would tolerate it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we can say is that we hope the Government and the Tariff Board are looking at this problem most carefully because it is one that affects not only the lives and jobs of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but indeed could well affect the future capacity of Australia to develop its vital industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is something that is operating to the detriment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and I believe that this Government has not done enough to try to control it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What hope can we offer the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that these important affairs of State, the provision of the necessary funds for the States to discharge their responsibilities, will be decided on a more rational basis in future years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This to me and I think to most <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> makes a laughing stock of this campaign about law and order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700922_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite and particularly successive Ministers for Civil Aviation have seemed, to indicate to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the maintenance of the curfew at Mascot was a retrograde step and that we were falling behind the progress of other nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700922_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The House will recall that in the first week of the first sessional period of this year - on 15th March - the Labor Party submitted a matter of public importance for discussion by the House which we, and 1 feel sure the bulk of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, considered to be of very considerable importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700922_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us at least go back on to the corner benches and endeavour to re-earn the respect of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>”? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700923_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 really suspect that the Leader of the Opposition himself, being the man of destiny he claims to be, will realise that many thousands of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are genuinely concerned that the Leader of the Opposition and some of his supporters should, while making antiVietnam speeches, be seen to be so patriotically attached to the Vietcong flag that they should make speeches under the Vietcong flag. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are becoming more interested in New Guinea and we all want to see this country obtain self government as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope this debate will make clear to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the perfidy of the motive behind this advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister intends to give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> notice that he is prepared to introduce this into this country and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must take notice of what the Prime Minister is telling them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must be prepared to say whether they want a Prime Minister of this kind or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must be prepared to say whether they want a system of this kind or not - a system in which public servants are used for overtly political purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But whether this motion is carried or not, the Prime Minister is condemned in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as being a faker, a forger and one who will stoop to any lengths to destroy his opposition in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the House, in the first instance, that the whole of this activity today has arisen because the Leader of the Opposition has recognised that Friday was the most damaging day that he has suffered since he became Leader of the Opposition because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> knew for once that he had given misleading advice and indeed damaging advice to the servicemen of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why would he say that the main issue before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is the private conscience of the Leader  of  the Opposition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was the Deputy Prime Minister who said at the weekend that the first decision, the top priority, for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to reach is a decision on the conscience of the Leader  of  the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For example, I hold up to the House this magnificent publication entitled Two Centuries’ which sets out to show all facets of Australian life and of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> including people engaged in protest demonstrations, lt was printed many, many months ago and no doubt it has pride of place in the private libraries of most honourable members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has sufficient notice been taken of the housing requirements of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I. go further and say that it is because of this approach that the selling of the scheme to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> 25 years ago aud since has been made possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As this is subsequently to the advantage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, we are proud that the Government has so often legislated sections of our policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the propaganda had been spread from here, and existed in South Australia, that if this dam were built the Chowilla Dam would never be built, the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believed this and supported the Government which was saying that they would lose Chowilla. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here again we have the vast majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> behind us in the present operation in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now we have the whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> behind us, and this is their concern, under the system of representative government we have inherited from Great Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a view of which I hope the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will take note because if it was carried into practice it would mean that in no theatre of war, in no war-like operations, could our Army, Navy or Air Force be assured of being able to undertake successful operations because those engaged in it would all have the right to say, ‘I, Smith, do not want to go to Vietnam’ or ‘I, Brown, do not want to go to Malaysia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That has been made known to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That has been accepted by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and that, in all common sense, is an alternative, and a proper alternative, to get the young man for whom the Leader of the Opposition says he is so concerned out of the obligation to carry out his service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition wish to go before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> now and say: ‘This is our view and if we ever become the Government we will put that view into operation, that anybody called up into any branch of the armed Services can choose the area in which he will fight’, let them say so, because we will not accept that, and if it were to be accepted it would be greatly to the detriment and harm of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a sheer lack of consistency, lt is the hypocrisy of members ot a part)’ who have their policy dictated to them by people not elected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that makes a farce of this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people of Australia have every right and justification to expect that the health regulations that govern the supply of meat to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> set as high a standard as the health regulations in any other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is - this again is a serious indictment - no machinery by which this Parliament or the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can assess by public and expert inquiry the real merits of the Government’s proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Negatively, American films in particular, featuring violence and the aberrations of the affluent society, do little to improve the minds and morals of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the depth of indigenous culture, I can only say that Australia has, for almost two centuries, had a different kind of background and development from all other countries; that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have faced their own peculiar problems, struggles and dilemmas; that our story is not without colour and emotional highlights and that Australians are recognisably different from all other people inhabiting the earth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-For 20 years this Government has deluded the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into believing that it had a defence policy but for a policy it has substituted slogans; for information, lies; and for discussion, pronouncement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that the Government has resorted to accountancy tricks to deceive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about the cost of maintaining our forces abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is for the Government to take such political steps as are necessary to adjust its economic policies to harmonise with the wage policies deemed to be desirable for the wellbeing of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Literally thousands of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who happen to be Aboriginals are living in huts or shanties, and it is impossible for the children in these places to carry on with ordinary school work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In intervening in the public interest no doubt the Commonwealth would put arguments along the line that if such a provision were made by the Commission it would have tremendous inflationary pressures; it would have social disadvantages by reallocating savings and income, and therefore the Commission ought to look at it in terms of whether of not it is in the interest of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and especially of the work force, to squander takehome pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701027_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My attitude to the war in Vietnam is that whatever happens inside Vietnam is a matter for settlement by the Vietnamese people and that what is happening in Indo-China is no business of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the Australian army or the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope however that we do not engage in this impetuous decision-taking in the future and that we have more regard for the preservation of environment, ecology and the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when we take into account the serious matters which concern us about defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One factor that affects this matter is that it seems that <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, who should be very conscious of the problems of road safety considering that we have- one of the worst accident records per capita in the world, are not keen to pay more for a car because it is safer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important for the morale of migrant children from wherever they come - and it was indicated that we now have migrant children coming from Asia, Europe and indeed all the continents of the world - that there is no misunderstanding in the minds of those children about the attitude of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We need not map them for the purposes of showing the limitations of territorial water: and the high seas if we lay claim to the rights of the Barrier Reef waters on behalf of the Commonwealth of Australia, which in effect would be on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the more unique features of the Budget which appears to have escaped the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is that there was a little nest egg of $634m buried away in it - more than what the Government needed for its current outgoings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To advocate a hard and fast price fixing system, which has been done quite extensively, is to propose measures for which we know - this was made manifest in a referendum on the subject in 1948 - that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton),  by his own actions and by Cabinet action, unquestionably has given the impression to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Australian economy is critical and vulnerable to the possibilities of galloping inflation and a consequent collapse of the nation’s economic stability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that our present Prime Minister is a man who is dedicated to the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, perhaps more than any other Prime Minister Australia has had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would this not be contrary to the spirit of the referendum in which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> gave the Federal Government power to legislate for the good of all the Aboriginal people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710223_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stated then - and I repeat if now- that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ought to be properly and adequately informed about these installations, which are being kept under such secrecy, so that the people can make an assessment about them, as they may be able to do in the future in deciding whether they will see a particular film or whether they will go lo South Australia to see ‘Oh Calcutta!’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710223_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, having looked at the total situation, to judge whether such comments are correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710224_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In conclusion, 1 commend to this House and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the final words of the Minister for Defence when he spoke of peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710224_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do not tell me that the Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in general go around looking for people to free from tyranny and to protect their independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710224_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there is the continuing drain on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and Australia’s resources resulting from our commitment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710224_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I place this matter before the House because I believe it is important for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to understand that the commitment in Vietnam is not simply 7,000 or 8,000 men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710224_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the circumstances surrounding this Bill are such that they will create in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, especially those who think, considerable doubt about the capacity of this Government to manage Australia’s economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710224_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one considers the circumstances under which the people of these countries live with absolutely none of the amenities that <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are used to in every-day life, one must admit that these engineers are doing a tremendous job and it is reasonable that these engineers, operating under the auspices of the Australian Government and other governments, should in fact be doing this work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710225_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Money which is made by a Government organisation ought to be used for the purposes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> either through the Government or by indirect payments and that is the basis on which this organisation will continue to operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710225_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that the great majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> appear to be ignorant cf the fact that China has thus long ago invaded Laos? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710309_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, the Labor Party praises the great political sense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, but then it turns around and says: ‘This Government has done all sorts of wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710309_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Actually, I think that 1 can leave the subject of his speech because, as I have said, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are politically conscious of what is happening in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710309_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather do I hope to be able to explain the fallacies in the arguments that he has put to the House and then to deal with some of the current issues that are before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the approach that will be taken by the Government to those problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As things stand, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been suddenly given a Prime Minister who has never presented himself to them for election in that role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that it would be a betrayal of the trust that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have placed in us if we were to change today the kind of government that they have so clearly demonstrated they want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>

    <p>The Liberal Party-Country Party coalition without doubt is pursuing a policy and a programme that ensures that the confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in it will be maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why we have moved this motion of want of confidence in the Government, lt is our belief, and I think it is the belief of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that we deserve a better government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is not good enough and the survey of educational needs should have been a spur and a whip to get the Government doing something more than giving the answers it has been giving for years and which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are getting heartily sick of and will no longer tolerate, as they will demonstrate at the next general election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710316_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it does uphold the validity, the Act can be strengthened and lead to more internal competition, if the Court holds the Act in part invalid, then we will have to consider approaching the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and asking them to give us more power to make the Act wholly valid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its objective is to give to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> truly representative government - and to give practical expression to the immortal words of Abraham Lincoln - which still echo down through the ages - and linger in the minds of all true democrats: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will see the sinister motives that lie behind this Bill and I hope that the House will really wake up to what is contained in the Bill and treat it as a censure of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A Labor government will, therefore, hold a referendum to seek approval from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for the removal of the anomalies and ridiculous restrictions inherent in today’s horse and buggy constitutional powers to settle industrial disputes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet this Government wishes deliberately to divide the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Moreover, it is equally correct to say that parliamentary rights are inseverable from the rights of the whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent weeks the Government has made productivity part of the conventional wisdom of Australian economics and has sought to persuade the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that increased productivity is the only thing worth while in our way of life and the only way in which our way of life can be bettered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 make this plea to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>: Slop arguing about silly things; stop having unnecessary strikes and similar happenings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are to have faith in their system of government they must be given regular and reliable information on the finances available and the programme appropriate to each level of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If that can be rendered as disillusion and demoralisation 1 can only say no wonder the Labor Party cannot win elections if it so misunderstands the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the trust which the Minister for National Development says the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have in this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The area of local government and semi-government financing is grossly neglected by the Government, despite the serious and mounting problems concerning the basic development and the provision of services for the immediate and urgent needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as the practical application of policy and nearness to the people are concerned, local authorities are far nearer to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> than either State or Commonwealth governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker,  normally at this stage of the debate I would deal in detail with points raised by honourable members, but because this is the first opportunity since my appointment as Minister for Labour and National Service lo speak on productivity, and in view of the importance of the subject, I intend basically lo utilise the time available to me in developing the Government’s view of what is involved and its implications for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has he given the classification to it because he wishes to keep its contents from the Chinese people or from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By deliberately hiding the facts from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the Government is guilty of blatant dishonesty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite ridiculous to suggest that this man, who has been working so actively and consistently in the interests of both the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian wheat growers, should try to do something which would deny access to what has become a very significant market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister said that the AttorneyGeneral was examining all courses open to the Commonwealth to impose severe penalties on persons convicted of mob lawlessness, violence and destruction and that when this had been done he, the Prime Minister, would announce the results to the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should realise that in Australia there is no right of free speech or assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill is calculated to increase that degree of control over the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> which the Duke of Edinburgh considers is already greater than ever before in history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the greater part of our history when control over the people may have been less, according to people like the Duke of Edinburgh, most of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> wanted to be free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has the feeling that most of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not really know when they are free, nor do they know where power lies in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Bill of this kind can bc enacted by this Parliament and tolerated, if not accepted, by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am pretty certain from all my experience in life that there is no real difficulty in keeping the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on the tracks, law abiding and non violent, if they are treated as human beings as they are entitled to be treated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I. did say in answer to a question that, so far as the movement of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the People’s Republic was concerned, we would not interfere and do not place any obstruction unless there is a security requirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the honourable member for Lalor is more respected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> than is the honourable member for Diamond Valley. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that at that time  Mr Tunstall,  the manager of the team, was highly critical of the assistance given to the team by the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We ought to be making a king-size attack upon these interests which for profit are prepared to destroy the -health and cause the early deaths of many thousands of young <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, perhaps of even greater importance is the fact that we are expected on humanitarian grounds to go to the assistance of another Commonwealth country in its time of great need and I am sure the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> expect the Government to make a more sacrificial contribution, which it has not done up to the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian policy makers have to realise that nations of the size and situation of Australia can, by their initiatives, achieve significant reductions in regional and world tensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were gravely misled and unconscionably deceived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government has deceived the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for so long about China that, clearly, it has come to believe its own propaganda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one cares to read the statement which the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  has made in this House, one sees that all he has said is that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> regard the matter with bitter disappointment and regret - the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, not the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had voted for the Australian Labor Party and if there had been a complete withdrawal of our troops, our future position would be such as very few thinking Australians would envy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another thing that the Leader of the Opposition has underestimated in recent times is the determination of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to make a contribution where subversion by Communist powers could possibly threaten our future security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we, and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, are supposed to sit and listen, to members of the Opposition decrying our involvement in that part of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are matters which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will want to know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say at this stage that I have been grievously misrepresented and in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> I have been placed in a very unfortunate position, having been classified as racist in character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have been represented in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as having misinterpreted or not knowing our immigration policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1  think it is about time that the attention of the House, of the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> was drawn to what is, in my considered opinion, an iniquitous situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the House are battling for improved working conditions for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter is not widely known, and I think it is time that members of this House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> knew something about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe it was the proper thing to do as it was an issue of considerable national importance affecting not only the Aboriginals in the Territory but possibly in other areas around Australia as well, and of course, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe it is quite insufferable that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have not been given a white paper dealing with Government attitudes on commodity agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>his colleague, the Minister for Trade and Industry, the suggestion that some of these things should be explored and spelt out more deeply for <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, industry groups and Parliament in general. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In international trade economic power is used even more ruthlessly than it is in domestic trade, and the Australian Labor Party will never consent to any change which hands over to the foreign corporations more and more power over the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With an Australian Labor Party government in office the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can be assured that all those who work economically and efficiently will be protected, but no-one will be allowed to make excessive profits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I think today has been a watershed for tariff debates in this country, and that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the manufacturers, the importers, the trade unions and everybody associated with our economy can now see quite clearly the dichotomy in policy on tariffs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that the monetary policy is right and it will adhere to that policy, because it believes that in the interest of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> it had to resist the inflationary pressures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party has at the top of its priorities the interests of the people and the cities where the mass of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But I believe it is a pretty poor tribute to the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that we” intend to allow the Bank these powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I firmly believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not subscribe to the centralising of the affairs of this nation in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition, having gone this far, should spell out to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> all the details of its statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada or anywhere else a patient will not get the same beneficial treatment that is available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These measures advanced by the Prime Minister in no way accord the priorities to the arts, to Aboriginal affairs or to the environment consistent with the needs and the aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in this, the last term of the century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the course of the winter recess there is not one Minister in this place - and all Ministers draw very high salaries - who will not be sitting in black limousines in cities from one end of the country to the other and who will pay no regard whatsoever to the problems facing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it was a powerful intrusion for good, perhaps, in the sense that it alerted the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the issues involved, more rapidly than they might otherwise have been, although I would not go too far in that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will see this motion for what it is - that is, a political gimmick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not regard as a matter of irrelevance that this motion which the honourable gentleman professes is of some importance should come before the House during the last 2 days of the parliamentary sitting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal approach is for the Government to put its hand in the Treasury purse, pull out a great fat cheque, go to any country in the world that can offer us equipment and, whether it suits Australia’s needs or not, buy it, and then say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>: ‘We are looking after your defence’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and those who have the responsibility to express their opinion - I refer to the Press media - have clearly stated that they cannot condone the Government’s attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I personally have never made any claim in this Parliament to be an expert on primary industry, the plain fact is that I can appreciate, as can all honourable members, that this Bill affects a great proportion of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who, to a very large extent, depend upon the initiative and enterprise of this Government while it remains in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the breathing space, such as that which I have advocated, would give the Government a chance - I am speaking in a non-Party political way now - to get across to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to the primary producers themselves the fact that we are living now in a rapidly changing situation; that this scheme is, in effect, what it is said to be - a reconstruction scheme; that we have reached the stage in our development where it is no longer possible to maintain the status quo in rural industry; and that quite substantial structural change is inevitable unless our rural population is to be reduced to a peasant level, and surely no-one in this national Parliament, irrespective of Party affiliations, wants to see that happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are shrewd operators in this game and, candidly, I have not a great deal of respect for the shrewd operator who will chase around the world in order to get his money at the lowest interest rate available and who will then, because nothing much has been done internally in Australia, exploit the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by investing money in the development of Australian resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710506_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every word of his speech was designed to attack the confidence of the community and nothing constructive was said to encourage the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in any responsible way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are to be divided, this Budget has sought to divide them even more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I can say that the members of this Parliament represent the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the highest national assembly we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget is worthy of a government that has never shirked its responsibilities; a government that has given the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> more than 2 decades of prosperity with full employment; a government that has made the strength and stability of this economy the envy of most other industrialised countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will show honourable members where I believe the Budget has failed to attack these problems and I will show how the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can expect to have them attacked by a Labor government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Would the Prime Minister be prepared to follow up the opposition to apartheid which he recently expressed to the Prime Minister of South Africa by writing to him immediately and indicating that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would welcome teams chosen on a multi-racial basis at the earliest opportunity? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have, for some weeks past, been contemplating writing a second letter to the Prime Minister of South Africa indicating what I thought were the feelings of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and, for that matter, my own feelings about the problems of apartheid and its association with sport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last letter that I wrote I pointed out the feelings of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - their regret and disappointment - and I also made known my own feelings which were exactly the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other Labor speakers on this side of the House have ably supported the honourable member for Oxley in presenting to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the case for a real social welfare programme and not the half baked, patched up propositions brought forward by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With all the good intentions in the world he has proved conclusively to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to pensioners in particular that the only way to get a social welfare programme, to which even he would subscribe, is to elect a Labor government in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let me agree with the contention brought forward by several members of the Opposition that we should expect this kind of rise because the standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have risen continuously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it would  seem  to me that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> just have not been considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It often confounds me, and I think it should also confound the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, to hear the speeches that he makes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I can say to the Opposition is that if it were to go out and propound this line to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’ it would only get the same result as it got in respect of the Malaysian defence agreement, the North West Cape issue and the Cuban situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On ever)’ occasion the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have repudiated the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will continue to repudiate the Labor Party as long as its members make speeches like the one the honourable member for Sturt has just made, which was nothing more than a sell out of our alliance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> both in Metropolitan and Rural areas should have the best of television programmes available to them and that television as a powerful means of communication should not be in the control of too few hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710910_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They acted in default of the legislation passed by this Parliament which, I lave no doubt, is overwhelmingly supported by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710910_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> recognise that if the Labor Party were in government it would dispense with national service and would slash the size of the Australian Army by one-third while it went about endeavouring to get sufficient volunteers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710910_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would be exploiting the situation for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and certainly not permitting private people to capitalise on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The curious feature of all this is that these loans go into the acquisition of assets which, in any event, are owned by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless I impress on the House, as I want to impress it on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that these factors, together with the increase in average earnings, are the 2 sets of figures we will look at with great care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know whether I was nurtured in a peculiar school - I want to put honourable members at complete ease and at the point of utter advantage as far as I am concerned - possibly it was an odd school but I am convinced of one thing, and I think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have got to come back to this: There is nothing, but nothing, in this world that one can get for nothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until members of the Opposition recognise that the collapse of the wool industry would pose one of the greatest social problem*, for this country in this century, whose revival transcends party politics, the sooner the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole will realise they have a common stake in the industry’s survival. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710915_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here we rind in the Parliament a Budget brought down at the time of greatest crisis in this country by a Government which is merely hanging together, with 31 changes in the Ministry, riddled with dissension and hatreds, members disappearing and hiding from each other and yet claiming to have the confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No government deserves the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when it conscripts young men to fight in a war, not because it felt the nation wanted them there but because it was following blindly the foreign policies of another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to say to the honourable member for Reid and to other honourable gentlemen opposite that we on this side of the House - and, I believe, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - are sick to death of the hypocrisy which characterises the Australian Labor Party’s policy on defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet here we are talking about our own region of the world; the region in which the Government makes some assistance available; the region into which <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as citizens and individuals, through organisations such as Community Aid Abroad, put funds to help raise living standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710930_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As we look beyond the end of this decade we must realise that much of the hope - many of the plans we have for Australia in the last decades of this century - will depend upon the skills, expertise and adaptability of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These vessels would be owned by the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and this would have enabled us to have controlled freight rates over the years and given to our primary producers the protection they needed from the sea bandits, the freight bandits and the Philistines of the conference lines who have had us by the throat for so many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can recall no other statement in detail by the Leader of the Opposition in relation to this question which I believe is a matter of substance not just for this House but in fact for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally enough, I appreciate what has been said about the views of the young people of this country, but the views of all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been taken into consideration and we have done what we regard as appropriate under the circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But again I emphasise this point to the House and to the Australian nation: We have a twofold objective of full and effective employment together with national development, but at the same time we want to do the maximum in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to try to control inflationary pressures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fundamental questions of the quality and availability of health care for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and, in particular, for such groups as migrants, have to be made subordinate to the question of the cost of care and the primary question here is the cost of insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this context it would refer to the traditions, ideas, attitudes, habits, manners, achievements and the way of life of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman knows as well as I do, as every member of the House knows and as presumably the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will know tomorrow morning, that at the meeting held by the Labor Party this morning the penalty suggested by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  and the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  was in fact decisively rejected on, I believe, some form of landslide vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in fairness to these bodies, and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, this Government should immediately commission an independent survey so that no hints of selective presentation of facts can be levelled at organisations connected with the wool industry, and also so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can truly believe that they have been given an unbiased presentation of the prospects of wool as an industrial fibre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, within those 9 months, we are able to show that wool is coming back, if we have done our homework in cutting our costs and cutting handling costs then we can legitimately expect the Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to support the industry until it gets right back on its feet, as I believe it will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that we have got this message through to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until now the wool industry has asked very little of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, but it has contributed quite largely to secondary industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would not be unwilling to help to pay some of the cost of preserving it for all of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that in the referendum of May 1967 the Commonwealth was deliberately vested by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with full responsibility for the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not have the technical knowledge as to what ought to be Aboriginal policy they showed that they had a real concern that a new deal was necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister’s responsibilities are all in different ways concerned with the quality of life which opens out before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is quite a substantial sum and one would imagine that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be pleased to think that this sort of grant in aid would be welcome to the people of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many leaders in the Territory, including Michael Somare, have said to me: The worst thing that could ever happen to this country would be if we lost the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, if we lost the services of the experienced expatriate officers before we are ready’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I am grateful for the contribution from various honourable members on the Government side of the House who endeavoured to show what the Government is doing in Papua and New Guinea which, I believe, is to the great credit also of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has provided less than half the amount of aid which has been sought by the Opposition which speaks for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in terms of the petitions with which the Parliament has been inundated week after week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government probably says: ‘Well we are the custodians of the public purse - of the taxpayers’ money - and we have to watch it carefully’, but I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would support a much more generous donation of aid and a continuing aid programme to the war victims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am firmly convinced in my own mind that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would support an aid programme of something like $10m or, if we are giving $1 per capita, of $12.5m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that on this occasion the Government will allow the amendment to be put to a vote so that honourable members may express their opinions in the same way as the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have already expressed their opinion on the level of aid which is being made available by the Australian Government for the East Pakistan refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendment, if complied with, would mean that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be providing approximately 1 per cent of the annual requirement of aid to maintain alive the refugees in India. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711027_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition indicates clearly to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to our new citizens that its only reason in advancing the proposal for the joint committee is to ascertain at parliamentary level from the experiences of the past whether any desirable changes could be made in the interests of those who are settled here, and those who may come, and how economically and socially to do the best for Australia and its people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here again, in an attempt to gain political popularity he has fallen down on his face again because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not want his immigration policy or the policy of so many others who have expressed variations of Labor’s policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The development of a genuine Australian sentiment from a vigorous <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be ruined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, to my mind it is very important - in fact it is vitally necessary - that, in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, those who have come from elsewhere to live here and those who may be born here or migrate here in the future, we do everything possible to ensure the continuation of the generally harmonious relations which have existed up to date within the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I feel sure that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would have no part of such a policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that many of the attitudes expressed by those people who doubt the capacity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to be tolerant and understanding are quite unworthy of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is significant because it represents a distinct back-tracking on the policy of disengagement by Christmas which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had been led to believe was the firm declared policy of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The statement today by the Acting Prime Minister indicates that the commitment into which this Government has entered may throw this nation into a conflict similar to the one in Vietnam about which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> feel very seriously and for which they condemn this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a responsibility of the Government to keep the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> informed and to take them into its confidence because a government which cannot do that does not deserve to be a government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Government is doing is once again throwing Australia into a position where she can be involved in a re-escalation of the Vietnam conflict at the very time when the United States of America is de-escalating and when the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want this Government to withdraw from the Vietnam war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any government that insists on debates of this kind at this hour of the night deserves to be condemned by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 can see no reason why, with roughly a couple of months of the year to go, we should debate at this hour of the night expenditure on the national capital which is of most vital importance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us proceed to discuss the question of electoral reform in this country because all of the matters related to it are vital to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We desire to have these matters discussed because how a government is elected is vital to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, lt is important that our electoral system should be the best that it is possible to achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However the Government allows other natural resources to be shipped out of this country at substantial loss to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All that the tenderers and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know is that for  12  months the matter is to be in limbo and after that it will not be resurrected, either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This can be done because these are national assets of which we have the trusteeship for the whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the record is a very sad one in the light of this Government’s administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I feel that it is time that the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  and the Cabinet in particular had a look at the work that is now being done by Australia House and other sections of the Department of Foreign Affairs to make certain that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian Parliament are getting value for their money from Australia House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are not the words of a dedicated member of the Australian Labor Party; these are the words of a very recent LiberalCountry Party Prime Minister who is using his head and not playing politics or playing on the emotions and fears of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for temporary political expediency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has aimed to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that ANZUS and the American alliance still mean something, and undoubtedly when he returns he will again tell the people of Australia, as he has told them for the last 20 years, that the ANZUS relationship is as strong, as valid and as vital as ever and that the Australian Labor Party is opposed to the American alliance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The curious thing is that these loans go towards the acquisition of assets which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, through this Parliament, own anyway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711110_reps_27_hor75/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When 1 look at the present accounts of the Post Office and the papers wilh which I have been furnished by the Legislative Research Section of the Parliamentary Library, I find that 90 per cent of the money required to run the Post Office was financed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711110_reps_27_hor75/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before the sitting was suspended I had been criticising the practice of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> having to pay interest on their own money which was borrowed from the Treasury by the PostmasterGeneral’s Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711110_reps_27_hor75/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in more recent times a sophisticated approach has been adopted and today the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- ‘the taxpayers of this country - have their own money taken from them by the tax gatherer and it then goes to the Treasury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711110_reps_27_hor75/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that money cannot be raised through taxation or it is unacceptable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to raise it in this way, we could think in terms of a tollway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711110_reps_27_hor75/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But we have this archaic set of rules, and my point is: Let us make a few submissions back to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, certainly every time on which there is a Senate election, because they are not so contentious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it declines to take this action it will stand condemned in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the innocuous provisions in this Bill demonstrate the pathetically puerile outlook of the Government and the Minister for Housing  (Mr Kevin Cairns)  in respect of the housing needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In Australia we have very high savings rates by world standards, but even though we have high savings for investment in Australia they have not been sufficient to open up all the resources that are available to us for the use of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, so that the inflow of capital has augmented our own savings and therefore enabled a stronger growth economically and in development terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I must say to the House that I believe that this capital inflow into Australia, put to use in Australia’s economic development, has been to the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In supporting this amendment I put it to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as we have put it to this Parliament on a number of occasions, that the benefits of the war service homes legislation should be extended to encourage young people in this country to become members of the armed Services and to accept their responsibility in this way on a purely voluntary basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Government puts its policies before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> it always says, “This is the only possible expenditure’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is hoping that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will fall for the suggestion put forward by the Australian Labor Party that if the Commonwealth takes over education it will be the end of all the problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711130_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the day he spoke about education in Adelaide, when he told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> it would not cost anything, he committed the expenditure of some S900m in one go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711130_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, after I had heard the honourable member for Melbourne Ports  (Mr Crean)  speak, I wondered whether it was worthwhile continuing the debate but I felt that it was wise to pursue it so that the Government could put its case before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and indicate to them in clear and unmistakable language  what  was happening in this country today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet this paragon of virtue stands in the House today and tries to present to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who had the misfortune to be listening to him a few minutes ago the impression that the Liberal Party is divided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he does not it will seem that he has lost interest  in  the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that it might be useful for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and for members of the Opposition to know the number of select committees that the Opposition has proposed during this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One wonders why, in this proliferation of requests for select committees, the Opposition is not brave enough to decide policies for itself and to come out and tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what its policies are instead of hiding behind requests for the establishment of select committees which would result in other people doing the work of the Opposition for it while its members get on with the internal strife which dogs the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the vital interest of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in this matter, an opportunity should be given for the facts to be stated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a matter that concerns the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and is fundamental to our growth and employment prospects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that colour television is desired by the vast majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, many of whom have seen it overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that colour television can be of great value to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in terms of culture, but that depends to some degree upon the quantum and the quality of the colour television films becoming available around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with our duty to the whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> we shall pursue the course of identifying wages as the main, root cause of the inflationary pressures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has the power to intervene in general wage cases to put logical arguments and economic realities to arbitration tribunals so that when they give their decisions - for it is the tribunals that give the decisions - they can have in mind all these factors which are so important to the economic welfare of this country and therefore to the social wellbeing of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result they have had to put up their charges and this is affecting the standard of living of all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House is indebted to the Opposition for bringing this matter forward because what it does demonstrate to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is that the Opposition is totally lacking in its appreciation of the root cause of inflation in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned that these factors are such that Standing Orders should be suspended in order that we in this Parliament can know where every honourable member stands on the question of whether we support the giving of favours to this great company at the expense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this side of the Parliament we are sick and tired of the Government evading its responsibilities and not voting on issues which are of paramount importance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to know the views of those on this side, whether or not votes are taken, who represent about SO per cent of the people, or are we to be cast aside when the issues are to be presented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the motion moved by the honourable member for Hindmarsh is that so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Hindmarsh from moving that the House believes that the Government should have acted to restrain the latest increase in steel prices by BHP. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the attitude taken by the Government, let me tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it is ashamed of its policy and will not allow a vote to be taken on it in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should realise that there is patronage unlimited for BHP; there is suppression for the workers of this country; there is unlimited unemployment under the policy being sponsored by this Government which refuses, on a great national issue affecting every wage earner in the community and every person in the country districts, to allow a vote to be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is to say, entrepreneurs and others come into our country, do not even bring capital with them - they use the capital of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - and take out profits to that astounding extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in general, 1 am certain, are disappointed that so little has been done by the Commonwealth directly, in its own right, since the people overwhelmingly amended the Constitution at a referendum in 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand there is the indifference of this Government and on the other hand there is the Australian Labor Party which will give effect and expression to the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who spoke forthrightly when given the chance to do so in the recent referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720223_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as I shall indicate later, the evidence also points clearly to the fact that on 6th April last year he also misled Parliament, when he stated that he had already taken action by communicating the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s feelings on the racial selection of a sporting team to the South African Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it obviously expressed only  the regret and disappointment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This was tantamount to saying to  Mr Vorster:  This is how the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> feel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that it represents the real opinions of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in regard to providing increases in social welfare benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Like the Labor Party, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> demand that people have the right to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been because of great co-operation between those nations and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that these joint ventures have been established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The idea that I was trying to express about a cheese bureau, as I visualised it when it was mentioned to me, was that it would promote cheese through shops specialising in cheese and allied products, which would give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> an opportunity to buy good Australian produce at reasonable prices instead of buying the higher priced, less flavoursome imported products which are being pushed by the delicatessen trade because of the higher markup and profit which they can make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was to put the Chinese into a poor light in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 9th September he was asked by the honourable member for Chisholm  (Mr Staley)  whether he would write to the Prime Minister of South Africa immediately, indicating that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would welcome multi-racial teams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have, for some weeks past, been contemplating writing a second letter to the Prime Minister of South Africa indicating what I thought were the feelings of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last letter that I wrote I pointed out the feelings of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - their regret and disappointment - and I also made known my own feelings which were exactly the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is doing it out of personal interest and to disguise the fact that the Australian Labor Party is so divided on matters of policy that it must create irrelevant issues on matters of little substance so as to prevent the public understanding them and their attitude to life and give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the opportunity to judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has probably one supporter but does he want this to be known to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to be debated effectively in this House or does he want to take up the time on what are completely irrelevant issues or issues that do not touch the substance of the matters that we have before us today? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is trying arduously to confuse the issue and to deceive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to prevent them from knowing what is happening in the Australian Labor Party and what its policies are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have, for some weeks past, been contemplating writing a second letter to the Prime Minister of South Africa indicating what I thought were the feelings of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and, for that matter, my own feelings about the problems of apartheid and its association with sport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A simple question has to be asked: Can the gentleman who occupies the position of Prime Minister in the Parliament be trusted when he makes statements to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, to our allies, to our friends and neighbours, on the evidence that the Opposition has presented? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But today the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are thoroughly awake to what the Government is doing, and it does not matter what the Government does, how much largess it hands out, it will face inevitable political destruction, and it will be well merited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will find that there will be in Australia an economic plan which will be to the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and which will make this nation take it proper place in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720229_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer to the other question he asked is that there is an equilibrium level of housing taking place in Australia which is appropriate to the desire of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and the level of that housing activity in this country for a number of years has been either the highest or second highest in the world per thousand of population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720301_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is not where this Government stands, because the attitudes of this Government have been clearly and positively stated in its industrial relations statement brought down in the Parliament during the course of the last session. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720301_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me reassure the House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Government is concerned about the future of the employees of the aircraft industry and the production of the aircraft industry, and will continue to show its interest and concern in the most practical way possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720301_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Govvernment cannot say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>: ‘We are credible on defence when a key industry is falling apart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720301_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the opinion of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that is not on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720301_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What concerns the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, 1 believe, is not what this Government stands for but what have been widely reported to be the opinions of the Leader of the Opposition on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> respect the concept of law and order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the question that the Leader of the Opposition must ask himself and that is the question that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must ask themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that as television stations have such powers for changing, shaping and structuring the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, they can be the most dangerous section of the media, just as they may be the most beneficial section. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we also believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have the right to put under scrutiny those people who are controlling this most powerful medium of television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But of course if we did not have protection we probably would not have many of the industries, and many of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would not be employed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an election year when 130,000 people are unemployed - and the figure is mounting - I think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and particularly those in industry, will want to know what are the policies of the major parties of this country on this important issue of tariff protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With an Australian Labor Party government in office the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can be assured that all those who work economically and efficiently will be protected, but no-one will be allowed to make excessive profits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would find that the price would be well up to what the cost would be in Australia because the margin would be very high if the Australian industry were unable to provide work for <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and at the same time maintain the competition that is necessary for that kind of thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable gentleman is very well aware, this is an area of concern to this Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> living in the cities of Sydney and Melbourne have realised that if Australia continues to develop along the lines on –which it has developed a serious social and economic problem will face their children in the years that lie ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want balanced development in both city and country areas they must overcome their present parochial attitudes and look for national solutions to this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But until more of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are convinced of the advantages of decentralisation, Governments are unlikely to be very quick off the mark in initiating decentralisation  meastures <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that this attitude which we have heard in this Parliament this afternoon would not be supported anywhere in Australia nor will members of the Government coalition parties when they go before the people attempt to support this stand, for it is not in keeping with the desires of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been invited by the Leader of the honourable member for Fremantle to adopt that principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The estimated cost of the Katherine sewerage system may sound a lot but when one measures it against military hardware such as Fill bombers and rocket firing destroyers it warms one’s heart to think that something is being done more directly for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The national capital fits in with the totality of the Australian nation and it must fit in with the priorities of the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the situation which I think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be confronted with at the present time not only in respect to such matters as these but also in respect to political issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was made perfectly clear during the campaign for the 1969 elections, when this Government was returned with a greatly reduced majority, that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> favoured the appointment of an Australian schools commission which, under a Labor government, would be responsible not only for dealing with the inequalities in education to which I have referred tonight- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is the sort of policy on education that the honourable member for Kingston wants adopted in the national sphere - this petty, penny-pinching policy that is adopted in the 2 States controlled by Labor governments - then I do not want to see a Labor government in the Federal sphere, and neither would most of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and that will be proven when we go to the election at the end of the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Sim will live to regret his intemperate outburst or I shall be deeply disappointed in the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to clarification of this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would ask them to do their calculations to see what an abomination they would put upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that anyone who considers these statistics that I gave to the House only a few moments ago will appreciate that since this country was involved in a military, sense, quite improperly in the opinion of honourable members on this side of the House and I believe in the opinion of a great majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, surely the Minister could have taken the opportunity to stress in his statement that there is also an obligation on the Australian Government because of its participation in this war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I use the phrase ‘Australian Government’ in the widest sense because it involves the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do have a responsibility in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The manner in which other Bills have been introduced into this House by the Government recently and been used for blatant political purposes by honourable members opposite to try to drag red herrings across the path of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is to be deplored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing in the Bill which is not acceptable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and I believe that it will be acceptable to the majority of public servants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am the representative of the majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; I speak up on their behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But clearly the Government has a responsibility to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to ensure that the major public services which are provided through the Commonwealth Public Service are not subject to direct interference by industrial action, such action at the present time being in circumstances which cannot be the subject of action within the existing provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister ensure that the President’s proclamation and the tragic situation which it describes are brought to the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked him to make that statement because I felt that now that our combatant troops have returned from South Vietnam the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should know not only what they did but the results of their achievements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind honourable members that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were behind this Government when that decision was made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has tried to deceive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are in his debt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the North Vietnamese were deprived of free elections a right which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have cherished for many years - they took up arms because they had been deceived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Bennelong had the temerity to say that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were behind the Government’s decision to send troops to Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> discovered the truth the opinion revealed by the gallup polls swung the other way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the answer of the Minister will the Prime Minister investigate, with a view to repealing, that section of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations of December 1968 which places what many Australians consider to be a form of political censorship on Australians in that it prevents the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from freely learning about both sides of the Rhodesian question? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720411_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there are matters concerned with Australia’s defence which ought to be brought to the notice of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720411_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-33-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not bring them to the notice of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for political purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720411_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-33-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These differences ought to be pointed out dispassionately so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole can make a judgment on which approach should be accepted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720411_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-33-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is another great difference between us and this, too, should be well known to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and that is the different approach to the ANZUS <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720411_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-33-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite its obvious party political bias it is a step towards a more intelligent and informed debate not only in this House, but also among the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on a matter that is vital to us all - the defence and security of the country in which we live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720411_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-33-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can draw little comfort from the Government’s sorry defence record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720411_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-33-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is all that this Government has to show to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in terms of defence preparedness after 22 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720411_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-33-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party wants the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to understand certain basic fundamentals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720411_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-33-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the Australian Government will be able to take care of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, with whom it is concerned, and I hope that the Australian businessmen will be able to take adequate and prudent care of their interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I am pointing out is a monumental confidence trick which is an impertinence to .the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the meantime let us the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know the situation and know about the disunity in this once great party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The veneer they have created and the smokescreen they have put up to hide the absolute futility of their policies and the completely unacceptable things, such as homosexuality and everything else that is thrown into the ring, are not acceptable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable gentlemen of the Opposition will declare their policies in detail in this House and through the Press we will then see what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have to say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> realise that in this country they have a Minister for Social Services who bases his approach to social services on a decision made a quarter of a century ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, they are paid as Ministers of the Australian State to administer affairs on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but I do not see very much evidence of either at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The measures before the House in relation to the tariff are acceptable to the House, or, at all events, to this side of the House and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Overseas manufacturers will be able to hold Australia and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to ransom because there will be no competition in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am sure that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would welcome an end to the ridiculous display that has been presented by way of Press, radio and television in the days preceding, and to some extent, following the holding of such meetings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the whole basis of the Government’s propaganda, the only way this wretched war and our futile, wasted commitment to it could have been sold to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> was by depicting it as a long distance war against China - a war to stop the downward thrust of Chinese communism between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would not and do not believe that North Vietnam, even a victorious North Vietnam, would be a military threat to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must be made aware of what has happened to this once great Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently in a television programme the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> gave a very clear indication of what they thought about that question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They even believe that some of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be carried away by what they have said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must face up to the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite, including the distinguished member for Grayndler, who is sitting at the table at this moment, know that when their Party was in office it absolutely ignored the reactions of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and, with great respect to the honourable member for Macquarie, this makes a mockery of what he has just been saying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Federal Government take immediate steps to act on behalf of all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to pre serve Lake Pedder in its natural state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there is a danger in the South East Asian area at times that the attacks that are made or the views that are expressed by the Opposition could run the risk of being considered to be the views of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Prime Minister ensure the fullest co-operation with the OECD secretariat now and with the visiting team in September and will he further ensure that the results of this first open scrutiny of the Australian economy and development will not be held up by the Government until after the election and thus deny the opportunity to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have access to an independent judgment of the Government’s economic performance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable member wants it another way and for our affairs to be handed over to organisations other than this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, he should have the courage to say so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The establishment of a Commonwealth exploration authority would enable exploration and development of petroleum fields to be undertaken on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It refuses to enter into the oil exploration field itself or to take an active partnership with Australian or foreign oil companies for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are seeing more and more of our basic resources being handed over on a plate to foreign interests, without any conscious policy on the part of the Government to develop these basic resources, particularly in oil and minerals, for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition takes issue with the Government on not only the question of the expenditure of subsidies for oil exploration but also the general principles on which, throughout the whole period since the first discovery of flow oil in Australia, it has controlled the development of oil and, more than that, the extent to which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are being deprived of their birthright. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that they are there and the coming Labor government will see that for Australia and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> those resources are recovered and restored to our natural heritage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, in my book, is quite a good record on the part of the Government, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and those who have assisted in this exercise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to realise that already there is an agreement covering the price of crude oil which will operate until 197S. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in fact should see those documents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of these documents has been prohibited from entry into Australia and I suggest that that decision is part of this Government’s attitude of trying to tolerate this movement and of trying to hide from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what this movement really is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the outset, I think I should stress that the Government and, I am sure, the vast majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> express their horror at the naked aggression of North Vietnam against the people of South Vietnam and extend their sympathy to the people of that war ravaged country who are the victims of brutal attack aimed at escalating a war that was in the process of being de-escalated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that the Leader of the Opposition will try to paper over the cracks in this latest expose over North Vietnam but what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are realising more and more is that the ALP simply cannot be trusted in the vital and delicate fields of foreign affairs and defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition’s attack is one of hypocrisy and the tactics used today have been to create a smoke screen to confuse the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as to the true situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who are presently listening to the broadcast of these proceedings realise that this is one of the most important issues confronting Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one matter upon which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have got to make up their minds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the important decision which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have to make is: Is the Labor Party genuine in its policy in respect of Vietnam and its opposition to Communism? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the statements of the Leader of the Opposition are only to cover over the facade until after the election, if the statements of  Mr Ken  Carr, who, on behalf of the 26 revel unions in Victoria spoke to the motion on Vietnam moved by the Victorian Branch of the Australian Labor Party, are correct, that every true Socialist in the Labor Party supports the National Liberation Front and wants the Communists to win in Vietnam - if these are the true outlooks of the Australian Labor Party - after the election it will be too late for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to say that they did not know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is something in which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have every right to be interested and they have every right to be disgusted with the Labor Party and its politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the end decision which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have to make in respect of themselves, their children and the future of Australia is: Can they place reliance on and trust in the Labor Party when it talks about defence alliances and Communism? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assure the House that the Government, for its part, has a great interest in these matters, as is shown by its activity in Papua New Guinea and by the very substantial sums which have been given to help to develop that country - a matter which I believe in general has the support of the whole of this Parliament and of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One certainly can see in this loan a continuation of loans, but it is an innovation in which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will increasingly have to become involved in the interests of the region in which we live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One thing is quite definite to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1946 another referendum for organised marketing was put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we sought to organise marketing for primary producers this is what we told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and farmers everywhere should be remembering it tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point at issue is that the members of the Country Party in this Parliament get 10 per cent of the votes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This in itself is a matter of some concern to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can the Prime Minister leave Australia when things are as I have just mentioned and when, I understand, the Liberal Club in Canberra is asking the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to vote Labor at the next elections? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, on all fronts in Australia today the Liberal-Country Party Government has been discredited in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Even if there were no danger of synthetics making inroads into the market it would still be necessary and proper that the Australian housewife, the Australian families and <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally, wherever they obtain their meats should be protected against unreasonable and prohibitive prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, the revelations which have come out about the preselection for a candidate in the electorate of Shortland must come as a shock to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable members of this House, indeed the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, can make their own assessment of certain people in the New South Wales ALP, about whom serious allegations of vote rigging are being made by members of his own Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is to bring up personalities because they are afraid that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will demand to examine their policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the next 6 months the Government is going to force the Opposition to bring forward its policies and let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> examine them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I feel that it is regarded highly by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am beginning to doubt whether it is worth saying anything in this Parliament, but I think it is time that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole began to face the situation which is arising in this country, where it is wrong - and it is admitted by the Opposition that it considers it is wrong - to work or talk or converse with anybody who is in favour of working against communism in this country, although it is perfectly okay for members of the Labor Party, at moratoriums or demonstrations about matters concerned with Vietnam or with the American alliance, to associate with communists and to march in the street under communist flags. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think it is time that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> realised and questioned what is happening under their own noses at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is time that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> began to look at what is happening in this country and what is being condoned by the Labor Party and those who claim to be acting on behalf of the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And the reason for this silence about Russia’s role is plain: The war in Vietnam could never have been sold to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> or to the American people except on the basis that it was essentially a Chinese war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believe that before Australia becomes involved in Indo-China the whole matter should be thrashed out not between the American and the French on one hand and the Viet Minh and Chinese People’s Republic on the other, but by the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, I am sure, are looking for strong moral leadership and expect the Government to come to the assistance of these people in a more generous way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All the States are making strong complaints to the Commonwealth Government regarding the problem they face in respect of their railway systems, Whether we like it or not the fact is that most <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> tike to live in the big cities and as a result we are paying the penalty in terms of road and traffic congestion generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and others who think like them, such an attitude is a bit stupid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister reaffirm the Australian Government’s belief in the value of the ANZUS Treaty to the defence of Australia and will he reassure the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Government will give all moral support to President Nixon in his efforts to bring a peace to Vietnam which will ensure the freedom of the South Vietnamese people to choose their own form of government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dealing with the last part of the honourable gentlemen’s question first, the Australian Government and, 1 believe, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> understand and support the action which the United States has had to take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, the Government has announced its support and I believe that the vast majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> understand and support this action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday in Adelaide 2 trucks owned by the Army, and thus owned by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, were gutted by fire andanother truck was severely damaged at the Payneham depot of 10 RASR. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, may I say at a more serious level that I think most <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believe that this is a blatant invasion from the north against which the South Vietnamese are defending themselves very courageously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The crux of this matter is that the Government is writing into this legislation provisions for making a political judgment which could have been legally made had the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> supported the referendum on wages in 1946. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They did not do so, and now what the Government is trying to do is to find semi-legal methods - because I doubt very much whether it is a constitutionally valid proposition - to get around the decision of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, because the Government knows that if this question were put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> again by way of referendum, it would be defeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he reads the Budget speech of the Treasurer he will see that the Treasurer referred to ‘potential demand’ and said that it was more than possible because of the much greater rate of increase of savings by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as shown in the increased levels of funds in savings banks, building societies and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This sort of rubbish, which T have produced, is being sold to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not want this legislation proceeded with, notwithstanding that it would be the overwhelming wish, I believe, of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and of all the members of this House, that this legislation should become law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720517_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has it something to do with the States or is it owned by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole through the national Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> might well take note of the fact that Liberal legislation, great or small, is never debated in the Party room. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope we will do everything we can to influence the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to abandon their smoking habit and not cultivate it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor movement and, indeed, the people in Australia were well aware that Australia was a country favoured bv nature and circumstances, lt became the ideal of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to establish in Australia a standard that was not to be determined solely or mainly by economic or social conditions in the old world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia was fortunate enough to be a new country and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believed that they could establish here standards that were better, not because we were better people but because we had far more favourable opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a significant sense the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have succeeded in establishing those standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, this Government does have some kind of regard for the real interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are, after all, an Australian government, and we are here to protect the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apparently he will have to come back to Australia or <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will have to go over there to look at the title deeds and his accounts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have thought that the only unequivocal commitments which the Labor Party has made on this and just about every other question are to a 10 bob each way bet on policy issues and to overall bribery of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by promising what is very nearly the earth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the good sense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will enable them to understand fully the reasoning behind this measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>submit that the Government has  not  kept pace with the good will and unifying influence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally who have held out a helping hand and a welcoming hand to migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They come here, very properly, and they are welcomed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will continue to play its part in this direction, working in partnership with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, in order continually to strengthen the industrial base of Australia, with the consequent maintenance of employment opportunities and the very high percentage of employment which we have maintained over a very long period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems incredible to me, and I am sure it is incredible to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that money of this order - approximately $1.5m to General Motors, approximately $ 1.25m to the Sulphide Corporation and almost Sim to Chrysler - is given away and the Australian Parliament receives no report, no details and no evaluation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These things are important to the welfare and the living standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should remain the cornerstone of Australian housing policy if anything meaningful is to be done to house the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to maintain the standards to which they have been accustomed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720531_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As legislator, administrator and arbitrator he served the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for many years and with great devotion and distinction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no funds at my disposal which could be used for this purpose, but I have no doubt that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would see that funds were made available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The Prime Minister will agree that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> resent overseas politics being introduced into Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me make this clear: If there is to be protest about the way in which the Government has been handling the affairs of the Aboriginal people, particularly since the Government took over control and responsibility for the Aboriginal people as a result of the referendum in 1967, then it is right that the House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should know how much we have done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He would probably agree with me that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would now be much more in favour of the Commonwealth having such powers than at the time of the 1946 referendum, for which a majority was secured over the whole of Australia but in only 3 of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This has been the effort of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> against these aggressors to help the South Vietnamese determine their own way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not be disappointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to test the Government’s support for this system of compulsion, will he agree to conduct a referendum of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in conjunction with the forthcoming election, asking whether they approve or disapprove of conscription? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, whatever the lethargy and half heartedness of the Government in the past, will applaud the Australian Government in now doing the right thing by this nation, this region and all mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One would have thought that a political party which claims to represent Australian workers would want to help to create an atmosphere which would result in a high level of business confidence and activity leading directly to more jobs and greater opportunities for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here was a situation of real concern to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I remind both Ministers that aquarium keeping is also a hobby which is practised and enjoyed by many more <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> than there are freshwater anglers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Prime Minister aware that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are waiting impatiently for a change of government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, even members of the Opposition, would be delighted to see the result of the wool sales yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should have been told that by 1975 a firm foundation would have been laid for a national highway system and for the modernisation of the urban transport system; that by 1975 the endless sprawl of the capitals will have been reversed and that our countryside will begin to be taking a new shape with the building up of new and existing centres; that by 1975 the Australian national Government shall have moved decisively on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to regain control of the ownership and use of Australia’s resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is a temporary and illusory and inequitable tax cut the limit of the aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real question before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is this: Who is determining the industrial policy of the official alternative government of this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal people are part of the Australian community and we do not have one law for the Aboriginal people and another law for other <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, in respect of uranium development and uranium enrichment there is need for  a  national viewpoint to be taken and for a national authority to handle the national resources of Australia, which are the birthright of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is fundamentally  a  position which we reject and which has been rejected repeatedly by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things that should be realised by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at this time is that whatever the Australian Labor Party may say there is no other country in the world that can be pointed to which has a greater stability and a higher standard of living than has Australia and with which the majority of people from the other parts of the world would like to swap. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, I would not like the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to think that that is all the aid we are giving to these flood victims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I share his enthusiasm that when we have the election the Liberal Party and the Australian Country Party will go into it with confidence, and I believe that we will have the support of the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way in which retribution can be exacted  for  this political crime is for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to reject the Australian Labor Party completely at the next election or, as the only alternative, for the Labor Party to change its leader. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would be a disastrous thing for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - for some more than others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must be reminded that this was the medicine inflicted on them this time last year and the tragedy is that it was the wrong medicine for the economy at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, I do not hold the cynical view of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> apparently held by the Government and its supporters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will judge this Budget as a totally inadequate economic measure as the level of activity continues to be slack and unemployment grows over succeeding months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the most part, they avoid reference to political strikes, despite the fact that some leading members of the labour movement have been, through political strikes, robbing Australians of some of their money, undermining the standard of living of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and adding to the unemployment pool, lt is true that the honourable member for Adelaide referred to unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Budget makes significant advances in relieving distress amongst the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and I have heard nobody from the Opposition deny that they are very significant advances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have now reached a stage in this nation  -  a stage which other nations have reached - at which a Budget is only one factor among a number of factors which will decide our national economic progress and the well being of our <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that we have here an enormous move in this year surely should be full indication to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that when that path is charted we shall continue to move along it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think they sell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> short if they think that they can buy back their support for a couple of dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does it think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> cannot see what it is at? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> now know that when an election is nigh the money can be found, just as it could be found back in 1964 when we started our arms expenditure for the Vietnam war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition made it perfectly clear to the Labor Party, to the Parliament and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that his personal opinion on revaluation did not in any way commit the Labor Party in opposition or in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is the unwisdom of talking about it which is the matter before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The communists, knowing that the mass of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were not readily accepting them and that they were becoming more clearly identified as Communists, started to pass in their official cards and join the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>If that is, the case, the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues have played their part in the development of this very sad malaise which is an ultimate and a great deceit upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have, set national goals which we will achieve and which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can afford, but not at the expense of the individual or to the detriment of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not fools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have every reason to be proud of the civil aviation achievements of this country, in both the domestic and the international field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are free to compete with each other, the purpose being to give equality of access and opportunity for both themselves and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that ali members of this Parliament, and indeed the vast majority of Australians, will support these proposals to maintain ownership of air transport enterprises in the hands of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a very great fear in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that any possible alternative government would be absolutely disastrous for this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They pay to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who own it - we own it; i: was not put there for BHP - the miserable sum of 1 1  ic  a barrel royalty for the richest oil in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Boothby asked me to say where the Labor Party will get the money to fulfil its promises to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that if they want anything out of a Liberal-Country Party government they should make sure that they have an election every year for the simple reason that the only time the public gets anything from the Government is in an election year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I say to the people of Australia that at the speed the Liberal Party has been going, finding the Women’s Liberal League after 76 years, and planning to abolish the means test 23 years later, it will be the year 2001 before a plan is brought down for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former Prime Minister, the late Harold Holt, had a 5 per cent taxation concession going on and off, playing ducks and drakes with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for so long that we forgot when the concession was on and when it was off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all 3 areas of which I have been speaking - inflation, growth and social welfare - this is a Budget which deserves the commendation of this House just as it has had the commendation of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not be hoodwinked by the desperate actions of these desperate men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is time that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> realised that, as 1 am sure they will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> irrespective of what the Government does, will make their decision within a few months and I am positive that the Government will be tossed out of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way we can do this is by establishing regional areas to take the weight off our cities and provide a decent life and good living standards for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One really wonders whether they live in the same world as most <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when they talk about subsidies to the rich private schools being aimed at ensuring that the children of all income sections of the community are able to go to these wealthy schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have every right to ask what are the priorities of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless the Labor Party decides to change this policy the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will have to accept that it will have serious effects on employment in secondary industries which already are feeling the cold winds of imports from cheap labour countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He puts it into the ring for international speculation and he demonstrates to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that he is not a fit and proper person to be the alternative Prime Minister of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is Labor Party thinking on national security, it deserves the rubbishing it will get from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am certain that there are few better illustrations of the extent to which this LiberalCountry Party Government has lost touch with the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> than its utter contempt and complete disregard for the problems of our cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are also very great indirect social service benefits to be sustained by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in respect of the changed taxation rates appropriate to this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A suggested solution to the problems of the growth of the Australian economy is that the Australian work force and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ought to grow by 1 per cent a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effects of that, I am sure, will be realised by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the very suggestion and the expectations which it arouses are like asking the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> not only to contemplate a guillotine constructed by the Leader of the Opposition but also to take pleasure in the coming months in the thought that he may drop it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not achieve that purpose because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> simply will not be deceived by the hasty, ill conceived, cynical, and narrow economic proposals that are the measure of this document. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I leave this to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and 1 am optimistic enough to believe that they will make the correct decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want particularly to highlight what I believe to be - and I would like the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to hear what I have to say on this - one of the most disgraceful, opportunistic and irresponsible acts ever perpetrated by even this lacklustre coalition Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is the sort of situation the Government wants in this country I am certain that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not accept it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget introduced by the Treasurer falls very far short of the vision and the statesmanship that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have every right to expect from their national leaders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> deserve the best. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would any person with 2 wits to rub together - I fear that may except one or two people - really contend that you can go to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with a referendum proposal and say: ‘Here it is boys, vote for giving all power to Canberra’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the ultimate test comes, when the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> realise the significance of the choice they make - responsibility in government or irresponsibility; that is the choice - people with normal cerebral processes should not be in doubt as to how they should vote on that occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what they will get. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It thinks this question needs to be asked by this House: Do the policies which have been promised to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> over the last 12 months or so represent in total one of the occasions to which the Leader of the Opposition was referring last night? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the main question for Australia and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> now is economic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1968, under the existing Government, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have had 18.9 per cent of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would have the most serious repercussions on the economy and on the living standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to make food more expensive and to make homes dearer? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In both cases - the campaign for shorter working hours and the Labor Party Leader’s comments on currency values - there is a salutary warning to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must ask themselves what the Labor Party’s policy on tariffs means for their future economic security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> need have no doubt where the Government stands on both of these questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In considering the Budget the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> also must make some other important decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the things which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must decide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The things the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be carefully considering in the next few months before the election are very clear to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have sufficient confidence in the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to feel sure that even now their minds are firmly made up that it is time for a Labor government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a Budget of action, of major and decisive commitments to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government’s initiative is, I assure the nation, a major social advance and will, I believe, meet with the widespread approval of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On behalf of the Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> I have already sent a message of sympathy to the Prime Minister of Israel and to the Israeli people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they are denied this fundamental right to the franchise, it is something which is unforgivable, I believe, in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am satisfied that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not ‘time-servers’, concerned only with the pursuit of leisure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They certainly are contrary to the expectations and aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as consistently stated in recent gallup polls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that this is totally contrary to the aspirations, socially and economically, of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a policy which is contrary to the aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Labor Party’s failure to understand the impact of shorter hours that makes it necessary for the Government to try to explain the situation to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what the unions and the Labor Party are intent apparently to thrust on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that I had been attacked because I had drawn to the attention of the Australian public a campaign by the Labor Party and by trade unions that was against the national interest and against the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very clear that the Government sees the national interest and the interest of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> differently from the way the Labor Party sees them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are consistently to seek higher pay for less work, living standards will suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are consistently to seek higher pay rates for less work, and if they are to demand pay increases in excess of productivity increases, the standard of living will not be improved; it will be damaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Labor Party underestimates the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when it seeks popularity by talking of reducing working hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party misunderstands the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and its responsibility to them when it proclaims the 35-hour week as a policy objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are asked to vote in the coming election on the alternatives of the Labor Party policy or the policy of the Prime Minister they will be inclined to vote for the Labor Party policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This statement has been made today so that the issues may be raised with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this basis the Liberal-Country Party coalition Government will take every opportunity it can to put the facts before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to resist this proposal which can result only in a reduction in standards of living and increased infllation to a crippling degree which will affect the unprotected in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is certainly high time that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were given the benefit of Government decisions based on such reports as those of the Public Works Committee and the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In all the conversations one has had about this and the letters and telephone calls one has received I suppose that the weight of opinion in the hearts and minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> has been 10 to 1 in favour of the people who were over there in the embassy, and I suppose that is the way all of us would want it it be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the members of the Committee were truly reflecting the interest of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> expressed a few years ago their vote in a referendum proposal put to them by the Government, by which they expressed concern for the uplifting of the standards of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be proud of achievements in the higher education field for the Aboriginal people through Kormilda College. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be behind the Government in the spending of this S3. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720914_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are matters affecting the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, what the honourable member for Bennelong observed is no matter of irrelevance to this House or to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the Minister wants to spend half a million dollars on them then that is apparently not the business of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who are footing the bill! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> wanted to see the soldiers who had fought in World War II and who wanted land given the opportunity to have land, and that was the genesis of this scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To achieve the best results for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole, we must together define the relationships, roles and contributions which will characterise our future co-operation in what we in the Commonwealth believe will be a major step towards further enriching the quality of life in our Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ministerial council will no more enlighten or impress the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> than do the Australian Loan Council or the Premiers Conference or other bodies on which once or twice a year Federal and State Ministers get together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These bodies are conducted in secrecy; the respective parliaments are not told of their deliberations; the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are  nol  alerted to what needs to be done in our Federal system by the Commonwealth or the States or both together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the interests of saner development and a more sensible use of our national resources,  1  hope all Australian governments, all Australian political parties and the whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will work together in the spirit of co-operation which will be needed to make this new approach succeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will see in this programme the chance to achieve a different kind of Australian development and, indeed, a new kind of Australian living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I look to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to make this programme work, and I will do all in my power to educate and to help increase the public’s understanding of this new national policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it appropriate at this stage for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to make these law breakers our law makers and rulers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It professes to be a balanced sort of article but it looks like the beginning of a campaign to raise doubts insofar as it suggests that <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are beginning to doubt whether this aid should be continued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Possible he underestimates the amount of money and the assistance in other forms that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be quite willing to support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are fortunate that we have such a man in this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need leadership from the Government and I hope that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the end of this year will make the decision that this was another stupid blunder of this Government because it never thought the matter through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We can sell natural gas for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and not for the benefit of any company or of the interests which are represented in this case by  Sir William  Pettingell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the increasing growth of the Aboriginal population - it is a fast growing section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - we are not overcoming the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the debate were about rich and poor schools and about privileged and under privileged schools, why would the poorest and the least privileged independent schools - there are many of them throughout the country - be insisting that the policy for them and for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is the policy of the Liberal Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They range from what used to be, at least until tonight, the approach of the honourable member for Fremantle which we have all admired, which was a deep concern with and belief in freedom in education, to the approach of those honourable members opposite who would nationalise, centralise and secularise all Australian education if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would only let them do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is something that is quite easy to knock over and I maintain that it is quite easy for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to understand all its implications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, that is a quits inane and stupid remark and it is not the sort of remark that the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are interested in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Obviously it is common sense that the migration programme has to be attuned to the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and indeed to the needs of the people who come here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The essential fact that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> need to realise is that a Labor government would admit migrants from anywhere at all without discrimination and, therefore, regardless of their ability to be successfully assimilated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the time available to me this evening is brief 1 will not devote any more time to that point, but I am sure that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will take those remarks of honourable members opposite for what they are worth and disregard them completely because I think that today they are well aware of the actions of this Government as it moves one step at a time towards injecting tear into the community in the hope that Government supporters will retain their seats in the Parliament and that the Government will regain office at the forthcoming election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>During the weekend the Leader .of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  was reported to have made a policy statement in Townsville in the electorate of my very good friend, the honourable member for Herbert  (Mr Bonnett),  which I consider should be viewed with considerable concern by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The delayed distribution has meant not only that the people of Western Australia will not have as many votes in the next House of Representatives as the Constitution says they are entitled to have; it also means that the next House of Representatives will not be truly representative of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> or even of the areas where the Australian electors reside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Government has acted to satisfy the Act and the requirements of the Western <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, by the steps which the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  has announced today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is up to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to say whether this is the kind of government they want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want a Minister for Trade and Industry who, when he really pushes hard and really does his best can go so far as to say that he hoped and is disappointed, then they have the opportunity to return one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I should think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want the Minister to do much more than to hope and be disappointed if his hopes are not realised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it does believe that it has a responsibility to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to do everything that it is proper for it to do to ensure that Australian industry is given the maximum opportunities to participate in Australian projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are very strong words by  Sir William  Pettingell, but they underline the insistence of AGL upon the highest standards of safety in the construction of this pipeline in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While in some ways I welcome this debate as a means of explaining to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> some of the circumstances of this matter, in other ways I am concerned about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are belated acknowledgements that problems exist - death bed repentances of a Government that feels that it no longer commands the support of 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and which is trying desperately in this last couple of months to say that it now recognises it should protect our natural resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But having said this, do not let us delude ourselves into thinking that all foreign investment, on any terms, is in the best interest of Australia or the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, before the Government could take action on such a large scale as is envisaged in the statement by the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  It was essential that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had commenced to recognise that if our capital cities continued to grow along traditional lines the day would come when they would cease to provide a satisfactory way of life to the people living in them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> living both in the cities and the country will appreciate the need for this action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are now finding out, despite Government secrecy, that carbon monoxide levels in their cities, particularly Sydney and Melbourne, are the highest in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am quite sure that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be interested in the matters which were discussed at this conference and the resolutions which were passed at Vienna. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I  just do not know what appreciation the honourable member for Maribyrnong has of the very positive steps taken in recent years by the Government to bring Australia as a nation closer to Asia and to bring the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> closer to Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is on these facts and our faith in the good judgment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that we rest our confidence on the outcome of the election now announced to be held on 2nd December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>According to a gallup poll published in May/ June 1972 the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are closely divided on the China problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want first to say something about the estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs if only because they do not include any appropriation whatsoever for educating the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> further in the need for aid for developing countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want to deal with one or two matters, the first involving what I consider to be straight out contempt of this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is anxious to grasp this sort of position so as to be able to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it is loved by all people overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, it should not be doing the things that it is doing and using the Public Service - people paid by the taxpayers of Australia - to present a very slanted and a very biased case to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to stir up their emotions and to try to turn them against themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite what was said by the honourable member for Burke  (Mr Keith Johnson)  who tried by a series of figures to reduce the cost of a 35-hour week, I think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally are well aware that the cost will he much heavier than that which was described this afternoon, lt will be  a  *cry heavy cost and the burden of that cost will rest most heavily on those people who have no opportunity of passing costs on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Scarcely a month goes by these days without some new amendment to a policy or, indeed, some completely new policy being put forward by the Labor Party to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for their acceptance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721011_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he tell the do-gooders who have been pressurising bis Department on African and Asian migration to exhaust themselves in doing something practical to help fair dinkum Australians to do something worthwhile for the Australian Aborigines who alone have a claim for justice and fair treatment by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721017_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-53-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the fact is that Australia has to get, or at least look at, the best technology in relation to the long term development of its resources, and it would not be honouring its trust to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> if it tied its hands in regard to at least exploring what was proper and best for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in developing these resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is also true to say that I think there is advantage in restating in this House, of Parliament, and before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the importance of this Bil] and the reasons why it should be passed into law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should be able to go to an international conference with one voice on behalf of the Australian nation and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but this Government will go to the conference next year and allow this intolerable situation to continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We hope that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, when they look at the policy of the Australian Labor Party, will realise that we want to ensure that we have our own ships, we put our own ships on the overseas trade, that we man them with Australian seamen and that we see that they are carrying a fair percentage of our own trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721018_reps_27_hor81/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What is facing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is the risk that a man so reckless that he would not bother to check before going on to the media to make these very serious allegations could become  a  Minister in certain possibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is another instance of Opposition mem bers seeking through trivia to try to mislead the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and their own capacity to do so is, I think, suspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I consider that one issue of which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be aware is the difference between the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#debate-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>whatever the timing, the right start has been made in an area which entails the great human issues of our times, for this authority will ultimately be concerned with how the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> shall live and how they shall live together in communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One great danger the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must be made aware of in the first euphoric moments of the Liberals adopting the principles at least a portion of Labor’s policy is the realisation that effective decentralisation does not occur overnight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To assist in this regard would require only minimal cost of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but the benefits arising from it would be very considerable indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On more than one occasion I have refrained from asking a question after what appeared to me to be a quite blatant exposure of philosophies opposed to the Government’s and, I believe, opposed to the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, in view of his comment that the Commission is responsible for its own programmes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721019_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-17-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What matters more to Australians than just about any other question is the freedom to choose a doctor, the freedom to choose first class medical care, the freedom to choose a health fund and the freedom to choose in respect of so many matters in related fields which are close to the hearts of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it any wonder that this is a gut issue in this country today and that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are reacting to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The last part of the amendment reads that the Government:  has not, on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, co-ordinated management of the Australian territorial waters in the interests of the long term conservation of the earth’s oceanic resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is worth saying because it is a reminder to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the sloth, the inertia, the apathy and the couldn’t care less attitude of this Government to issues of this sort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it will be a better Parliament after I have left it, not because of my absence but because I feel that the great majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are becoming more civic minded and more determined to maintain the prestige of this country and to do everything to ensure its success. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was because this Government had been representing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for so long and had been so devoid of any real positive policies and of any real human understanding that it made its immoral decision to go into the war in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will not, however, permit any State Government or State agency to frustrate the clear will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> recorded so overwhelmingly in the 1967 Referendum that the national Government should assume constitutional responsibility for Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730227_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that when the late Harold Holt made the comment ‘AH the way with LBJ’ he was expressing the affection and opinion of a great majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, not only in respect of the President’s actions but also in admiration of the responsibilities that this man was carrying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730227_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his policy speech, the Prime Minister proclaimed to the nation that the 3 goals of the Labor Government would be: Firstly, to promote equality; secondly, to involve the people of Australia in the decision-making processes of our land; and thirdly, to liberate the talents and uplift the horizons of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first matter concerns the way in which the Labor Party intends to manage the resources of the Commonwealth of Australia to the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The end result of that is that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> receive next to nothing by way of royalties because the people whom the former Government supported are the doyens of big business and multi-national corporations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Prior to the dinner adjournment I was referring to Australia’s natural resources’ and reminding the House that the programme offered to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by the Australian Labor Party took the Governor-General 45 minutes to read. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have yet to see the form of the agreement accepted by this socialist Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sincerely look forward, and I am sure a great percentage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do, to the introduction of a true sense of democracy into the voting procedures of this country so that we will accept the principle of ‘one vote one value’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It must slowly filter through to him and to honourable members now sitting on the other side of the House that they tried this in 1972 and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> rejected it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The overwhelming support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for these policies is understood by them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We need not delude ourselves that the activities of 121st Signals Squadron were secret to anyone - anyone except the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Government in its position of  Her  Majesty’s Opposition until the elections of December last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Government can claim that some of its actions have been taken as a result of the mandate given to it - a mandate that was by no means overwhelming - the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were not aware or expecting, let alone told, that the degree of national political realignment following the election of a Labor Government would be so radical and pursued with such indecent haste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that this House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> need an explanation as to what the Prime Minister did in trying to get this man out of China when he knew, as Leader of the Opposition, that  Mr James  was in China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we on this side of the House talk about democracy we mean the right of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to tell their elected representatives what they want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would ask the Leader of the House to be patient and indulgent because he of all people will know that unless he is prepared to be indulgent and patient with the Opposition parties who wish to mirror the aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> correctly, as we see them, we on this side will make life very difficult indeed for the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 am amazed to hear the comments of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lynch),  particularly the threats he made when referring to the parties on the other side being determined to mirror correctly the aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for he was a member of the Government which operated under the old time schedule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How well did the then government, with its sitting hours, allow the Opposition to mirror correctly the aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition says? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the record of that minority Government which now utters threats that if more sensible hours of sitting are arranged it will obstruct the meeting of the House because it cannot correctly mirror the aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is very true that this morning we debated a matter of very significant concern to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have voted for a change in the government of this nation, and as a member in opposition it will be my duty to analyse the measures introduced by this Government, to expose weaknesses in its policies and legislation and to inform the Australian electorate of alternative policies and another point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that a government which adopts these criteria and these standards to guide it along its path deserves the judgment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the previous Liberal-Country Party Government got in December last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we believe such criticism to be justified we should at all ‘times seek to put’ it before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an answer cannot be given are we and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> entitled to believe that this is not the man of the new age but the man for the double standard - the man who preaches open government and yet denies to colleagues close to himself the opportunity for consultation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was pleased to hear mat the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lynch)  recognises the change in society and that he concedes the fact that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in voting in the last election voted for a change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the opportunity to express their views as Australians . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matters which were placed before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the Governor-General’s Speech as the programme of this Government constitute a programme to bring Australia forward into the 1970s out of the dim, dark ages in which the unimaginative LiberalCountry Pary government maintained it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious, when one looks at that Territory, that it will continue to depend, to an enormous degree, for its development upon the generosity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and that generosity will, in fact, be reflected in the policies adopted by the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are those who will argue that we won because of the positive leadership shown by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and the carefully worked out and imaginative policies that he put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the whole of the period of his leadership of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not about time that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> started to hear the program and policy of what is laughingly called the Opposition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incentives to industry and others to produce more goods and services of real value will quickly raise the standard of living of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and will enable a more rapid implementation of the programmes outlined, lt is also pleasing to see that mention is made of the need to fight inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To use the term ‘primary’ is to misunderstand Australia’s national objectives, its future path and the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is completely and utterly unjust to members of a section of the community who, as my friend the honourable member for Canning  (Mr Hallett)  said the other day in this chamber, were the main contributors in allowing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have a credit balance at the end of the last quarter of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a course which will make a stronger and stronger impression on the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it any wonder that the former member for Warringah, that dignified and honest politician,  Mr St  John, said that the Liberals fell from office because of their lies, their subterfuge and their falsity to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They fell from office because they lost the confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, because they could not get away any more with their lies about Vietnam and the People’s Republic of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Government in this country for years tried to frighten the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with the threat that the Chinese were about to land on our shores. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I believe that the Barnard-Whitlam Administration acted in accordance with the overwhelming wishes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in acting as it did while the results in borderline electorates were being decided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This also met with the approbation of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will continue, despite criticisms, to implement the policies that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have wanted for so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have a feeling about land which is not understood by most of us, although when one considers how closely the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are applying themselves to the preservation of their environment one can get some understanding of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the responsibility of every member of this Parliament to expedite the passage of Bills such as the one before the House now in answer to the demand of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the reforms outlined in the policy speech of the now Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  be implemented without delay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the social service field, as in other fields, the Government is the inheritor of something that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have created during our time in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely, he went on, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have the ultimate right to decide whether they should accept or reject the risks of integration into American nuclear strategy in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that this agreement should be renegotiated to give Australia some of this control which the former government pretended in its treaty it was giving to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and which it violated in a private exchange of notes between  Sir Garfield  Barwick and  Mr William  Battle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can all be assured that good relations will continue between this Government and the Government of the United States and .hat the sovereignty of Australia, which is of vital interest to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, will not remain as it is now but will be restored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is important that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should understand that the objectives which the Labor Party promised to achieve in its policy speech and in the speech of the Governor-General are a long way yet from achievement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the people of Australia are put out of work because the industries in which they work have suffered and cannot compete with their competitors overseas, the Government will have to answer to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for this decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This we believe is a basic abrogation of the Government’s probity and integrity as the sovereign and elected representative of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The result and effect of this irresponsibility, I say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, will not be apparent for some time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am sure that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will come to realise eventually that there is certainly a wide and undesirable gap between the previous Liberal Party-Country Party Government and the present Labor Government in relation to adopting a responsible attitude towards overall financial policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time will not permit me to deal with all the ramifications of this policy but let me say to the House and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that if this promise in the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> elected us to Government, and turned out of office the Liberal-Country Party coalition they accepted a whole new range of ideals and ideas and of policies and objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a traditional view probably becoming increasingly widespread that <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want to own their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very useful to the Left to have a weak front man, because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would never vote for the extreme Left. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today I take a further charge against him for an economic crime against the exporting industries and against the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by his clumsy, damaging handling of the Australia dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In December last the Labor Party presented the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with a campaign of soft sell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, he could be sold to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> much more easily than some of his more traditional Labor Party contemporaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the outset he realised that the Labor Party had been kept from office, by the fears of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the left wing elements of his Party and left wing unions, particularly in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Criticism of the United States policy is one thing but the hysterical nature of the outbursts deeply shocked not only the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but friendly nations around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 2nd December last year the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> exercised their periodic prerogative to change the political complexion of the national government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have witnessed the performance of a government that was prepared to take legislative action and to make concessions to important national commitments purely and simply to win elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now whilst 1 do not deny the right of people to make their own decision on how they should live their lives and, obviously, these people made their decisions, I cannot believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will accept the position where government policies will favour those who least need assistance and discriminate against those who most need help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his opening address to the new Parliamest  His Excellency  the Governor-General outlined the Government’s plan to effect these changes - a blueprint for the future of Australia and for the future of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a program designed to fulfil the needs and the aspiration’s of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, this is a cynical and offensive observation which reflects on many thousands of good <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The broad canvas of the Government’s legislation is in response to the needs and the awakening of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last 10 minutes we have had absolute proof of the reasons why the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> felt that this nation could survive only with a change of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only repeat that we on this side of the House feel that we will not get from the Government treatment equal to the treatment that we as a Government gave to it in Opposition, but we hope to have the opportunity to fight for the percentage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> whom we represent, and if the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will give no undertaking whatsoever other than to state that the priorities have to be met in the interests of the whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They knew that this action would not come from the then Government, which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> subsequently threw out, so (hey turned to the Labor Party to give them a chance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was a very definite indication that should the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been cursed by another 3 years of that style of government nothing would have happened during the life of this Parliament just as certainly as we now know that nothing eventuated in the life of the last Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that this Parliament is today considering the extension of the franchise to 18- year-olds is due to the decision of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to accept the Labor Party’s proposition at the time of the last election that ‘It’s Time.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the bulk of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the other political parties want the age reduced to 18. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives to those who sit in this Parliament the opportunity to say whether they believe in these democratic principles and the equal rights of all electors, or whether they stand for manipulation of the Electoral Act to retain governments of their political colour irrespective of the vote of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it pursues this course, as it seems determined to do, then if will discover that it is seriously damaging - indeed it has already - the productive and export base of the Australian economy, not to mention the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who depend on that base for their living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not try to lull the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by saying that because there has been a higher percentage of unemployment in the United States of America, Canada or Britain therefore unemployment in Australia is comparatively satisfactory at the level it reached last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point that is simply being reflected here is that if there is any misconception on this side of the House as to the Minister’s intentions and the Government’s intentions, the Minister has a clear responsibility to the Parliament, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the migrant community of this country to make his intentions clear through the medium of a ministerial statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this matter is one in which the Parliament as a whole can make a real contribution to the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would support any move to give the Commonwealth power to regulate prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think humour should be introduced at the right time and I do not think this is the appropriate time, when we are debating a matter of such importance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and particularly to the low income group, for the honourable member to make such remarks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The objective of the Australian Government is to provide the best possible deal for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, irrespective of whether these people live in the city or the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blame if we will - no, do not blame them too much - the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because our failure is parallel with the failure of other people in other parts of the world who have met this same problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not only due to Government inaction, it is due also to the fact that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have not recognised, over the decades, that the Aboriginal people deserved a much better deal than they were getting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About 90 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> decided that this Parliament ought to make laws for the benefit of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must make sure that we speak with a united voice in this Parliament and give a united lead to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because they have given us a mandate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to educate the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as far as racial discrimination is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here it is a question of using the mandate that was given by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the 1967 referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although this increase will not completely change the position to what it should be, it shows that the Government is making every endeavour to give extra effect to the decision of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in 1967 in the referendum to give the Commonwealth the right to legislate on matters affecting the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that they themselves made an application for these leases indicated clearly enough that they were happy to accept land under the same laws and codes that applied to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that I am surprised at the tenor of the question asked by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition because the records of my Department indicate that he when Minister for Immigration was deeply concerned at the activities of criminal elements in our community, a small group of people in the total migrant intake but nevertheless too many because one person in our community who is addicted to violence is too many in terms of the acceptance of these activities by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless it is satisfactorily bandied by the Government as a whole, and not individually by 27 Ministers, it will be found that so much of the good done by the preceding Government will be destroyed but, above all, the alleged goals of the Australian Labor Party to control inflation and to bring real benefits to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be destroyed in the process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However 1 believe it is highly proper, in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that the problem should be identified as much a? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course this is something with which obviously the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not agree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I am sure that it is something the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>General who placed the interests of an obvious terrorist ahead of the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, there would be some who would be impressed by the countervailing libertarian considerations on which his submission was apparently based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some years ago the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by referendum expressed overwhelmingly the view that more should be done for Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of  Senator Murphy’s  reluctance and failure to explain in his statement and to reply to repeated questions in another place as to why he raided ASIO, and in view of his statement made yesterday that he was not denied information by ASIO, will the Prime Minister now respond to repeated requests by the Opposition and the Press to explain to the Parliament and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> why  Senator Murphy’s  action was necessary? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But it comes down to the question of how serious we, as the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, are in our determination to handle inflation, how capable and genuine we are and how realistically we approach the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has by no means full power over wages, yet the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> look to it alone to provide stability, growth and opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been moved with the intention of showing this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Leader of the Country Party was fighting, not for his personal rights but for the Country Party to be accorded its proper status in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would have created bitterness and resentment by sec.tionalising the Public Service which could have operated only to the detriment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> through diminished efficiency flowing from that sectionalisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Prime Minister use his best efforts to ensure that this organisation is exposed and that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are made aware of its true aims and objectives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not fools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> expect and are entitled to expect a reappraisal of our foreign policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I say, the Opposition does not resist the conclusion that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are looking for greater adjustments and changes, and ones which perhaps they can more readily appreciate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say also that in some respects the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have not fully appreciated the extent and the nature of the changes in foreign policy which the Labor Government in office has been introducing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But these are matters of considerable significance to the future of Australian foreign policy which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ought to consider. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that visit did reveal to honourable members and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a degree of naivety and even of arrogance in the Prime Minister’s approach to Asian regionalism and a lack of understanding of the Asian view of these problems which required  Mr Adam  Malik, the Indonesian Foreign Minister, to give the Prime Minister a very gentle admonition or instruction when he was there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The test will be whether the minority on this committee is able to investigate the matters I have outlined, which are of real importance and significance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think Opposition members show a complete lack of knowledge on the subject when they push out these pious platitudes and expect members on this side of the House to believe them and apparently hope that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will believe them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not put up with a gerrymander. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If there is one thing that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want, it is stabilty, whether it be in politics or anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major issue in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is whether they are to have the right to have a say on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a dangerous game with very real risks of irreconcilable alienation of a significant minority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I assure these <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who are city dwellers, particularly those living in the Lilley electorate, that I shall not be a party to selling them short and downgrading the value of their vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister for Services and Property seriously suggest that  Mr Watson  in 1902, looking at his argument, was seeking to impose something distorted upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple truth of our existence is that the great majority - the overwhelming majority - of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> live in a few cities and common sense, quite apart from any other consideration, commands us to look anxiously and realistically at the position of country interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the results of the last election are a clear warning to the Legislative Council in that State that refusal to pass legislation from the House of Assembly on matters in which the State Government has a clear mandate from the people will result in the Legislative Council having to answer to the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for their actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I could not help thinking that they must have coalesced some way and discussed it, because it was precisely the same speech that his father made here in days gone by, depending to the last drop on the right of the Country Party for special consideration because it cannot obtain votes from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely this Labor Government has sufficient confidence in its policies and in its abilities to believe that it can attract enough support from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> without having to attempt to assure political immunity to boundary alterations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if we are forced to put this issue to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> they will realise what the true situation is and will realise that in order to change it they will need to re-elect a Labor government, if the matter goes that far. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask this House to agree to this clause and to carry the Bill because I believe that the measure will be to the ultimate advantage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and democracy in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>to (5) In pursuance of undertakings given prior to the elections to keep the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> informed of the facts and of the choices before them, lists of reports not published by the McMahon and previous Governments in recent years have been drawn up with a view to considering release. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-36-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the fact that the AttorneyGeneral has said that the Prime Minister does know why he visited the ASIO office in Canberra, because he discussed his visit and the reasons for it with him, will the Prime Minister now pay the House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the courtesy of answering the question? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that we clearly indicate that we do not favour this regime and anything that I can do to ensure that this transmission is not effected will be brought into being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That newspaper and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are sick to death of the contempt with which the Parliament and the nation have been treated by the Prime Minister and the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have liked the right honourable member for Higgins to have moved that we call to the door of the Parliament some of the great capitalists of this country so that we could hear how they are exploiting the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> through prices and such factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If an Opposition is stupid enough it can force a lot of gags to be moved, but in this Parliament we have a lot of legislation to be passed which is tremendously important to the country people, the city people and overall to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that it would be un-Australian and would be regarded as such by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to expect Customs officers to burst into a home where it was reasonably suspected that the householder was making his own home brew. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honestly, honourable members opposite must think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are utter fools and that they will accept the sort of nonsense that went on in this House when the Commonwealth Electoral Bill was debated when they find what happened with an electoral Bill in the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave - In his policy speech last November, the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  said that the Australian Labor Party was determined that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be restored to their rightful place in their own country, as the owners and keepers of the national estate and the nation’s resources, and as fair and equal sharers in the national wealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The owners and keepers of the national estate and the nation’s resources are the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and their Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I certainly hope that this measure will be carried unanimously and we can get on with the job of giving the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what they are justly entitled to - homes of their own to live in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The bare recital of  Sir Arthur  Fadden’s parliamentary record, distinguished though it is, does little to express or explain the regard in which he was held by the Australian Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The nation and each of us are poorer for his passing but his contribution to the building of the nation will not be forgotten and we will always retain the memory of a dedicated and genial leader whom we had the honour to serve just as he so selflessly served the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps in all this his greatest single attribute was that he always treated the task before him and his service to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with the utmost seriousness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister who is in charge of the Bill and who has a responsibility on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, not simply on behalf of the unions that seek to exercise their total control over him and the conduct of his portfolio must, we believe, should speak out in this debate and let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know where he stands in relation to the agreements which have been made and those which are foreshadowed at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Government will not look on it purely as something with which it can score political points but instead as something that it can support because this problem faced by young married couples of financing their house in difficult circumstances which can be aggravated by the birth of the first child is one which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole have to face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would mention only at this point that this report does not deal with the effects of radiation from the French tests on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So I say to the honourable gentleman that to advance the argument that dual nationality confers insuperable difficulties is not satisfying as far as <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does the Labor Party accept, apparently without question, the account of the Yugoslav Government, a government now shown to have treated the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with contempt? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What an insult to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia visit this country knowing that 3 Australians had been executed by his Government only 3 days before! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister’s clumsy efforts to cover up for the Yugoslav Prime Minister are an insult to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, to the Australian Parliament and especially to the families of the men who were put to death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is the Prime Minister not prepared to take the firm action that should be taken against a foreign government that has so shamefully treated the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Prime Minister should stand up and be counted as a person who will defend the interests of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and who should not allow them to be executed by a firing squad in a foreign country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore it is most questionable whether the availability of a loan to a man who has served for only 3 years in the Regular Army or in the other Services is fair and equitable as far as the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are concerned and also as far as the majority of those members of the armed forces who served generally for a much longer period are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was interesting to hear the remarks of the honourable member for Lilley  (Mr Doyle)  in the adjournment debate this evening because I want to mention some matters at this stage that I believe should cause concern to thinking <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>History will prove that he and his cohorts were a party to something that was almost more barbaric than anything that was previously known in this history of mankind - the involvement of this great country in the filthy Vietnam war about which the previous Government did not tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the truth from its inception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course this period during which we currently are in opposition may be seen as a temporary mental aberration of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware that this Parliament realises that the ability and the willingness of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to embark on a program of increased public expenditure depends mainly on our economic growth, an acceptable tax level, and naturally upon other demands upon our resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The capacity to produce goods and services for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be determined by our capacity to train workers to perform the necessary tasks involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely it is our business in this House to try to give some leadership to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> shall be restored to their rightful place … as equal sharers in the wealth and opportunities that this nation should offer in abundance to all its people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister’s second reading speech is totally devoid of the philosophical considerations which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have the right to expect from a Government which lays a major claim to the principles of social justice and equality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In spite of the Opposition’s attempts to frustrate it, this Government is determined to establish industrial peace and harmony in Australia and thereby lift the conditions of employment and the standard of living of all the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I will in a few moment’s time mention the motivating force behind this legislation and I believe it will explain completely to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> why action is being taken in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the benefit of those who have not had a long experience in industrial matters, a bans clause is one which, under the provisions of the Act, can be inserted into an award because there has been a consistent line, of action and policy by a trade union of defying the provisions of the Act and award and causing industrial disputation, lack of production and, therefore, a failure in productivity despite the benefits that increased productivity can bring to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Monopolies and other large enterprises many of which are foreign-controlled and aided and abetted by government, deny the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> their right to a higher standard of living, while enjoying unprecedented profits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This element is to be assessed without any regard to any over-award payment, service grant, industry allowance, or similar payment; what are reasonable needs being determined from time to time in the light of standards generally accepted in progressive communities, and the social aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition is using the matter of union amalgamations as a big bogy in an effort to frighten the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is clearly the sort of attitude <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> respect and, I believe, accept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is not really a fair go for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, who are very greatly affected by what happens in amalgamations of unions, the putting together of very powerful groups in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All that the Opposition parties and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are presented with is a series of Press statements day after day, week after week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reaction of the Australian Government fresh from receiving a strong mandate from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is to proclaim proudly our own independence and self-reliance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is significant that this Bill to make abortion easily available on demand is offered to this national Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when other countries, with long experience of legal abortion and its harmful consequences for the individual and society, have either restricted their earlier laws or are moving to restrict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I oppose the amendment because I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want to know and are entitled to know where the national Parliament stands on this issue, one of the most strongly debated issues that has ever been introduced into this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the last election the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were assured by the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  that abortion on demand was not an election issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is simple and has the clear and definite purpose to set up an authority with adequate powers to construct and operate a major public utility having the responsibility of making one of our greatest natural resources available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is within the memory of every member of this House that when sporting representatives from a country that is notorious for selecting its teams on a racial basis came to Australia the people of this country, including of course trade union officials and members, raised great protest at the flaunting in the face of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the policy of such a decadent regime as that of South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally no longer are prepared to accept the false notion that those who retire can be regarded as second class citizens with second class needs and, certainly, with second class benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think of the Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones)  who, with his iniquitious Australian National Airlines Bill shortly to be debated by this House, is seeking the same social blueprint to control the transport industry in a manner which I believe to be totally repugnant to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I believe it is a sufficiently compelling observation to commend itself certainly to this side of the House and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have needed a national Government which would exercise the undoubted right of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to construct such a pipeline as will be constructed after this Bill is passed through the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We shall have people on the board of this authority running it efficiently, running it in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, making sure that when one well of natural gas dries up it will be possible to plug into the grid another available source of natural gas, available in the interests of all Australians whether they live on the eastern seaboard or the western seaboard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the national interest is referred to and when the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are mentioned in a debate of this kind one must think of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other serious factors that will push inflation to the roof are, of course, the Government’s support of union claims for a 35-hour week, which looks like coming into effect over the next year or two, costing not only the employers but also the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> an additional $3,000m annually. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not entirely alien to the character of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and I would not suggest that those words were appropriate for a national anthem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should choose, but the pundits are going to choose for us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Australian Broadcasting Commission, or whoever it is, plays the various tunes with a view to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> choosing, I hope that the tune chosen will be not one that has been the subject of a competition but one that has been adopted as the Marseillaise’ was adopted, as the ‘Star Spangled Banner’ was adopted or as ‘God Save the Queen’ was adopted - that is, by a general consensus of the people born out of the circumstances of war or from traditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When it meets it is the centre and the forum of expression of opinion on all the great matters facing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I join with the honourable member for Curtin  (Mr Garland)  and the honourable member for Boothby  (Mr McLeay)  today in somewhat regretfully drawing to the attention of this House and of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the paucity of performance that has characterised the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  since his elevation to that office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be dampened down, otherwise there will be wide-ranging effects upon the economy and upon the living standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 repeat, because it is the major point 1 bring to the House in my speech today, that the setting up of this Tribunal, like the setting up of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Prices, is largely window dressing, to make as much noise as possible by the Government to fool the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into believing that the problem of price rises which they see and which affect them very much is being grappled with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is also contemptuous of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because few Australians will be able to understand the real substance and real purpose of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it should be held that sovereignty with respect to the continental shelf does not reside with the Commonwealth, there would be a powerful case to be put before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are united as Australians, speaking with an Australian voice, it will not be a voice which will be petulant; it will not be -harmful to one State as against another; it will have clear national objectives for the good of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are delegates and representatives of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> elected to speak on their behalf in the national interest and not in the interests of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a question of centralism at all; it is a question of whether the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be able to assert their sovereignty over the waters around our coast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should we not pass a Bill which will give the people of Australia, for the first time in our history since Federation, absolute and complete control over these assets which are of such great importance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is something which, I believe, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are well able to achieve for themselves and which I am confident they will achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason I gave to the British Government was that my Government believed that this was a matter appropriate for determination by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I was wondering whether the people associated with Flag Motor Inns and others who are so much opposed to the expansion of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s airline - TAA - and who now come to the defence of private enterprise had the same concern when means were made available to Ansett Airlines of Australia and others to expand and whether they then forwarded telegrams and made protests about that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who knows, we may have some of the wild men who come out of the West and seek to administer this Bill in a way that would bring fright to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts are that we did not moot the changes which the Government is attempting to foist on to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> right now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Being the honourable member for Diamond Valley and coming from Victoria, recalling the election results of only last Saturday I think if I were a member of the Australian Labor Party I would suddenly be waking up to what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want the 2-airline system to be competitive in all aspects, and we believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want the airline system to operate in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Government would have liked to do away with the government airline, but it was not game to do so because over the years the support by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for the people’s airline became well known and that action would not have been tolerated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the past 2 decades he has had a pretty fair run and he does not want to see the government airline put on a basis where it might be able to compete freely and provide a very good service for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that because of these circumstances there is a right for the people on this side of the House to put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the other side of the picture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regarding the appointment of those men, I can assure this House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that at no time did I select persons for those positions other than because of their inherent qualifications for the tasks which they were required to fulfil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I did it to help the whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> it was wrong: When a Labor Minister does it to attack our primary producers it is right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That will not work to the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would be great value in a Green Paper so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can assess what is the overall intent of the Labor Government’s policy in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is not an announcement that should cause the Leader of the House to have any great sense of joy, and I regret that he sought marginally to politicise a subject of very great concern to an important section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He would be well aware of the strong stand which the Opposition Parties are taking in saying to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that this Bill is shabby, and discreditable and, I repeat, unbecoming of the honourable gentleman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the Government that far from this document representing any threat, by inference or in any other way, to the Opposition Parties, we welcome it because we will stand to gain as a result of the good sense of the Western <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> they know full well how badly regarded and how disregarded they are by the present Government in all of its activities, as it seeks to develop a centralised administration in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time I must say that this issue was put very fully from time to time before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and at the last election they voted the present Labor Government into power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is one of a number of important issues which were put before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and I think it is fair to say that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be entitled to expect this Government to carry out its promise when elected to power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this would be contrary to the wishes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as evidenced by their vote at the last election, following the way in which this matter was put to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in favour of that? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, having said that and given that warning as to the possible implications of this Bill, I come back to the point that I believe that councils and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to expect funds as a result of the promises that were given to them by the Government which they elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legacy of inadequate housing that the Government has inherited will now be resolved in accordance with the mandate given to this Government so generously by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will continue to regard the housing problems of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as being paramount and of high priority and sociological importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House further agrees that the re-drafted Bill be given adequate time for detailed examination by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and consultation by the Government with the bodies concerned, as the period of six days allowed for consideration of the present <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have always wanted and will continue to want some balance of control against the exercise of power in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will be of benefit to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In future the Whitlam Labor Government will be marked as the most realistic and progressive that this nation has had since federation because it has faced up to the realities of the times and has given overall benefits to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> today and for generations to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has worked to the satisfaction of both sides of the Federal Parliament in both Houses and I believe that it is quite unnecessary to conjure up fears as to how it will now operate when its charter has been extended to cover the two-thirds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who live in New South Wales and Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in co-operation the Australian Government and the Western Australian Government could develop that area in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that there is an urgent need for the Government to think through its policies and explain them to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government was returned on 2 December with the wholehearted support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for innumerable policies right across the board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it any wonder that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have realised, as evidenced by the most recently published Australian National Opinion Poll figures, that the Federal Labor Government under the Prime Ministership of  Mr Whitlam  is the most constructive and progressive government of this decade? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have never known in my experience such a curious attempt being made by a government in possession of its wits to mislead the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be a very serious thing for Australia and for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should this ever happen because it would open the door to all sorts of totalitarian actions of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So every effort must be made by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to ensure that we do not allow the central government to whittle away the authority of the States and the rights of the States generally, as it appears to be doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not anything other than a compact which all the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> voted for when the Federation was originally formed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, but when the principle of one man one vote, one vote one value is departed from it causes damage and a lack of faith in the body politic, not if it is done to equalise the States but if it is done to ensure that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not get the government for which they voted; when it is an arrangement to ensure that a minority can stay in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Australiawide competition for an exclusive Australian national anthem will the Prime Minister ensure that the copyright remains with the successful composer and that the royalties dependent on such copyright also go to the composer, especially as no additional cost will be required of the Commonwealth Government or the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> if this is done? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does he not think that it is humiliating to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that an Australian head of Government should create the impression that, Watergate style, he is crashing into the White House uninvited? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I set out last night my view that rightly or wrongly in a referendum in late  1967  or early  1968  the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had rejected our proposal that we should break the nexus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister’s amendment has been moved so that, in the unhappy event that the Liberal and Country parties take office again, honourable members opposite will have the very arduous task of facing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and saying that they want to take these amendments from the Bill and change the operations and functions of the Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It could mean the manipulation of those reserves in such a way as to be to the distinct disadvantage of that commercial operator but not necessarily to the advantage of the economics of consumption of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave - I take this opportunity to report promptly and briefly to the Parliament and, through the Parliament, to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on my recent overseas visit to Mexico - the first by an Australian Prime Minister - to the United States and to Ottawa to represent Australia at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  has at last made a statement to the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on his recent lengthy overseas visit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The frequent arguments between him and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and  Mr Lee  Kuan Yew of Singapore are well known to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in his international affairs statement in this House in May that this Government had not sought to take Australia in new directions with its foreign policy, yet in an address to the Mexican people he referred to the new direction his policy had taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he has offered alternative proposals privately he should indicate to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what those proposals are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ought to be informed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the earlier meetings in the mornings will cause some inconvenience but honourable members must expect to put themselves out to some degree if the Parliament is to implement the reforms for which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have asked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Or perhaps it relates to debate in this House, which I understand is the forum of the elected representatives of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have not even attacked the Government for setting aside S2m to brainwash the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about its own proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a tremendous challenge to the Minister and the Government and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to overcome that enormous problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are still unaware of the Government’s detailed intentions regarding the Electoral Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, Australia’s electoral law - and the manner in which it facilitates the expression of the political wishes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - will stand up to the closest scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who deny this concept of equality should have the courage to admit their attitudes in public so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> may pass judgment on them at the first opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a disgraceful state of affairs when members of this Parliament stand up before the  Speaker  and blatantly say: We think that there should be perpetuated in the laws of this country a system which will allow for a minority rule of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If need be I have no doubt it will not be tolerated by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite sure that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not want to see in this Parliament such a lopsided political structure as is being proposed by the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Against this background it is very difficult to see how the members of the Opposition can now, after all these years of unanimous advice and in view of the demonstrated views of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> today, impose deliberately almost a hardship on the migrant community and those citizens who want to apply for Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make this appeal to the Opposition: Put aside prejudices and petty party political considerations and vote this time in conformity with the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and hold out a welcoming hand to the people who are here now and those who will come, without wishing them ill or wishing them hurt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the honourable member for Wannon for bringing to the notice of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the shoddy tactics of the Minister in declaring in this chamber that he was basing his immigration policy on the result of a gallup poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am confident that the overwhelming majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will support the steps taken by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Tied up with the concept of this Bill providing excellence and with the Film Development Corporation providing finance for the making of Australian films is also a requirement that there should be provided to those who make these films a full opportunity to show them to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not care how many theatres are bought or how much coercion is brought to bear on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to look at an Australian film, if that film is not produced with a quality that the people demand these days, they will probably look at television or at something else, go swimming or engage in some of the other activities which are so well known in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly it might raise a certain cheer among the unthinking - the sheep- on his own side of the House; but, just as Walter Bagehot would not go along with the financier, so the vast majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> today who generally think about these things too deeply will not go along with the Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are we going to buy back Australia for logical and sensible reasons associated with the real interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> or merely because it sounds like a good idea? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister assure the House that the Government’s admirable nationalistic zeal will not be allowed to run so wild that it will be counter productive in its impact on the development of the Australian economy and the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An educated man like the Federal Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  knows that as day follows night a situation will emerge in this country that will require strong fiscal action and  strong  economic policy to cope with the result of inflation and at that time the Government’s plan is to go to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and say: ‘We now seek overall control of the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether this is meant to be a manifestation of an intelligent economic objective, but in reading those sentences I thought that I might ponder their meaning because surely if the Treasurer believes that we ought to be establishing public transport services at public expense he could differentiate between a policy designed to do this and the effect within the economy on thousands of Australians working in the automotive industry building motor cars which are being provided for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those policy proposals were accepted by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and we were in duty bound to bring them into operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in those 2 areas that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have clearly indicated that they believe a greater amount of money should be spent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our Government is the first to recognise the absolute right of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to recreational and sporting means and facilities - and the first to do something about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of this change we should have had better living conditions for all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, to resort to the tactics of muddling up the previous Government’s tariff’ policy on the construction of Australian built cars to make sure that no firm gets a proper share of the market and so that no economies of scale can apply at all seems to me the reverse of the proper way to produce cheap cars or good value cars for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the tragedies of government in Australia and indeed one of the tragedies besetting the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is that the high hopes of the founding fathers of Federation have not yet been realised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the most vicious, vindictive and savage attack ever made on any section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> has been made by this Budget and those people living in nonmetropolitan areas and particularly those in country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why would not the Country Party want some loaded system of voting when under such a system it gets only 9 per cent of the vote of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but exercises 20 per cent of the control of the Parliament when in government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sincerely believe that it is of the utmost importance for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to keep in perspective all recommendations and aspects of that report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is not in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that we should do nothing or limit our own powers in trying to hold our own a little more effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This objective I believe is supported by over 90 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I interpose to point out to the House and to the people that there is an opportunity here for the ordinary citizen to share in the kind of capital appreciation which so far has been confined to a very small percentage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the overriding economic concern of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - and one would think it should be the overriding consideration of this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tragedy of this Budget is not that it fails to provide enough money for the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New-found and long-awaited rural prosperity - and perhaps transitory prosperity has been mistakenly equated with long-term wealth, and a sector of the economy, and of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that has been through a lengthy period of depressed incomes and depressed outlooks is dealt a tremendous blow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It lashes out wildly in all directions, making savage attacks on the industries that produce the financial resources on which all advances in the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must be based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this Government must understand, and what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must understand, is that if this nation’s free enterprise foundations are weakened too much the whole structure of the community and all the Government’s welfare and other programs will be endangered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following that he was able to fool the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, win the election and we then saw the greatest bout of inflation that Australia has ever seen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, through responsibly looking at the needs of the economy and the terrible neglect in the areas of social welfare and education by successive Liberal Party governments, wehave been able to provide for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and at the same time introduce a Budget that will allow the business of Australia to move along, that will allow our factories to run at peak production, with people at a peak level of employment, with the number of unfilled jobs as high as they ever have been and, at the same time, we have tried to do something creditable about the appalling 13 per cent level of inflation created by the former Government 12 months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From what I have said about education it can be seen that Australian children will get a better deal this year and so will the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in general. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Court is less representative of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> than are their elected parliamentary representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister to put this question to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not expect any government to give money without also thinking about responsibility for the way in which it is spent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the reintroduction of the Bill, the Government demonstrates its determination to adhere to its policies, as announced before the last election, and to which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> gave their stamp of approval on 2 December last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present situation is an intolerable one, where certain sovereign States claim the right to prevent Australia’s own High Court from adjudicating in Australia on an issue of sovereignty which is the sole concern of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and their nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather, it begins a process which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> elected us to carry out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is realised that this Government is looking across the wide scope of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and is determined that an under-class shall not develop, even though the majority standard may be said to be so high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An expenditure of $100m has been earmarked for a pipeline authority, destroying for private enterprise the opportunity to do its own thing for the advantage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Whitlam Government has dishonoured these promises and in doing so has worked a confidence trick on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1944, the Curtin Labor Government put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a referendum seeking Federal powers to control prices, and it was the Liberal Party attitude on that occasion to campaign for a ‘No’ vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  do  so because from the first time the Federal Labor Leader announced Labor’s policy to introduce a national health scheme - for which subsequently the people of Australia by their vote gave a mandate - the Australian Medical Association, individual doctors, representatives of hospital benefit funds and the Press have launched a campaign to vilify and abuse the scheme for the express purpose of creating an area of confusion amongst the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as to the true purpose of our health scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the forefront of Labor’s election campaign last December, a better deal in education was a major plank of our election platform, and I am certain that this issue was a major factor in the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> electing the Whitlam Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what the overwhelming majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To say that this Budget is a disastrous one as far as beneficial effects on this country and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are concerned, and that it foreshadows other disastrous measures which the present Government administration will introduce, is in my opinion an understatement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I picked out just a few items from speeches by Opposition members like ‘doctrinaire socialism’, ‘the greatest domestic disaster of the day’, ‘the most vicious, vindictive and savage attack ever made on any section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any percentage increase in profits over a percentage increase in wages leaves the mass of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> worse off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present distribution of the nation’s wealth is not equitable; 90 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> earn through wages only 63 per cent of the nation’s wealth, whereas the remaining 10 per cent receive 36 per cent of the gross national product through profits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AH the public statements of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Overseas Trade  (Dr J. F. Cairns),  when speaking of inflation, speak of an ‘acceptable’ rate of inflation but never has any of them had the stomach to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what rate of inflation they believe to be acceptable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no .doubt that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are better connoisseurs of meat than the people of any other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can only come to 2 conclusions: either the Treasurer and the Government have no conception of the necessity to take all embracing action to curb inflation even if it means becoming unpopular with their political masters; or, on the other hand, the Prime Minister and the Government are cynically cold bloodedly and deliberately generating a state of economy designed to lead people to the conclusion that the Federal Government has not sufficient power to deal with inflation and therefore that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in desperation will acquiesce to the demands for total centralised power in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It promised the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> effective laws against restrictive trade practices but the legislation it introduced was practically useless and had extremely limited effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many industries today the shortage of skilled labour required to produce the goods and services desired by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is creating the inadequacy of supply which is an important element in rising costs and prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did it adopt a broad national outlook about the need to train more of our youth in the skills required to produce more housing for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But they will have an effect on prices to the benefit of the economy and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ingenuity for masquerade shown by the Opposition will not mislead the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are paying a high price for the centralist doctrinaire socialism of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Postmaster-General and his officers fail in their duty it will be clear evidence that history has swung a full circle and that what was happening in 1949 - it was one of the reasons why the socialists were cast out of office - is happening today in 1973, and that happening in 1973 will be one of the reasons why at the first opportunity available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the Labor Party will again be cast out of office and put back on the Opposition benches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are so many things: The Australian assistance program; the special provision for homeless men; the inauguration of a program of national superannuation; the setting up of the inquiry on national superannuation, the report of which we hope by the time of the next election we will be able to present at long last to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; and a national compensation scheme inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason is that this Government has not been prepared to put or has not been able to put before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a comprehensive economic policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government deserves the strongest condemnation from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for its deplorable handling of the Australian economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I leave that question to be answered by honourable members opposite and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a measure which I believe will receive the endorsement and support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - when it is put to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is part of the infrastructure of development and the daily living which the Government has a responsibility to provide to all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I will cease with these words: The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are one people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tragedy is that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> might be so taken in by the Prime Minister’s attractive wrapping of the parcel that they will not bother to have a good look at what is inside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is not the slightest doubt that the Prime Minister is using inflation, and the hurt it is causing to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, to support his plans to acquire greater powers to control and regulate the economy, industry and business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister will tell us what terrible fellows the State Premiers are; how they have refused to co-operate with his government in its great humanitarian desire to control inflation in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, whom the Prime Minister is asking to give him very strong powers, will weigh very carefully the credibility of his claim that the Budget, more than anything else, set up excellent defences against inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How could I support this proposal knowing, as I do, that it forms part of this socialist Government’s strategy of taking an increasingly firm grip on the activities of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at all levels? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to look very carefully at the proposition that they were being asked to change their nation’s Constitution, with one of the grounds advanced by the Prime Minister in support of this proposition being  Mr Hawke’s  promise on wage restraint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He fought to explain pretty quickly to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> why he tried to pull the wool over their eyes in the way in which he did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be making a grave mistake if they give the Government this power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister is offering the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a pig in a poke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill, he says, is aimed at giving the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a chance to say whether the Government should have power to control prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what is much more important is that neither do the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have the slightest clue as to what the Prime Minister intends to do with the powers he is asking us to give him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let it not forget that it is profit that will finance all its geat schemes for the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet that is what die Prime Minister is asking the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to agree to in giving him power to control prices while he refuses to do the things already open to him to control inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an attempt to deceive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into giving dangerous powers to the Labor Government - thereby playing right into the Government’s hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will fall for the Prime Minister’s ploy at their peril. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be a tragedy if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> fall for his confidence trick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opposition supporters describe this Bill as a Bill that seeks to give the Australian Parliament a power to administer the Australian economy - as an attack on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One does not often see them in their true colours but one often feels that what they are saying is: ‘We seek a power if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will give it to us to do something about inflation.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The voice of its members is not a voice which has expressed a concern for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a situation which is inconsistent with the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> wish this Parliament to have this power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is significant that the Opposition is opposed not only to the referendum seeking to grant that power but also to the measure which will allow the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to vote on this important question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are clearly being exploited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He asks the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to place the blame for high prices on those who cannot afford to pay them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal which is before this House is for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have a say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is only one issue before this House arising from this Bill: Should the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a voice? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not trust the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That may be what the Leader of the Opposition wants, but it is not what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that if they are given the opportunity the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will endorse the proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Liberal and Country parties oppose this Bill they will not only deny the responsibility of the national Parliament to control the national economy but also they will deny the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the right to say at referendum what they want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These public reports will serve as a standard by which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be able to judge the Government’s performance in the social welfare area having regard to the information provided and the recommendations made to it in the Commission’s reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not accept irresponsible strikes initiated by a communist in a sneaky way, a strike caused by an internecine union jealousy, a jealousy which would not allow a woman to be given a position of responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has rejected that challenge because he and his colleagues know full well that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would not be prepared to return his Party to government on the basis of the legislation which he initially introduced into this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not need to take that opportunity because what can be said is so self-evident to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to warrant no repetition in the course of this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> expect that any statement made in this House is a concerted approach by Government supporters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think that the Papua New Guinea Government, the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must not ignore the underlying social tensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not at all concerned about that situation because it encourages me to believe that the Government of Papua New Guinea, during the year or so prior to independence and in the years following independence, will be loath to spend money on military equipment and also to believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> prefer to be in the position where they are able to recognise, in some way or another - perhaps by some mutual defence treaty or agreement - that we will be prepared to look after the external relations of Papua New Guinea conjointly in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without destroying Aboriginal culture, we want to help our Aboriginals to become an integral part of the rest of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, we want the Aboriginals themselves to have a voice in the pace at which this process occurs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of them, because they have had to try to assimilate and integrate into the white community, will have to be accommodated in the same types of conditions in which white <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> live in the cities and towns around Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people are as keen to work as are white <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Bill, and the Bill the House passed last week, are passed by the Senate before the Parliament rises this week, both Bills can be submitted together to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for their decision before Christmas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has the Government done to reduce or even contain the alarming increases which are eroding the incomes, threatening the well-being and depressing the spirit of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This oratorical shenanigan will not befool the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will have the overwhelming support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for both of these proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not going to consider, nor are the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> going to consider when the question is put to them, an incomes and prices policy; they will consider only an incomes policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no inclination by the Australian Labor Party under its present leadership to give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> any time or opportunity to consider other than a brief pattern of how this Government seeks to extend its powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is not the explanation, the Prime Minister has connived in misleading the Press, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Victorian Government to develop a properly integrated fuel policy for the benefit of the Victorian people as a whole, with ultimate influence on the use of Australian resources for <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, not to swell the bank balances of overseas investors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Minerals and Energy has indicated that the backdrop of our philosophy is to use the Australian resources in the interest of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; not in the interests of Esso, Australian Char Pty Ltd or any of the masters of the people who sit opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want them to add weight to what they say and to assure this House that the committee will get the complete co-operation of the State Country Party and State Liberal Party to go through a meaningful examination of the proposition, cease to sabotage it, cease to hand over the resources to private enterprise and co-operate with the Minister who has indicated clearly time and time again that we want the resources to be used in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sincerely hope that it is carried and that we can get assurances from the Victorian Liberal Party and the Victorian Country Party - the cohorts and the counterparts of the honourable members sitting opposite - to ensure that it is carried out not as a cheap political exercise but in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally and in particular the Victorian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are committed to something like 7 referendums, all of which will cost millions of dollars to hold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must recognise that fact and recognise also that the Government has severe financial problems in the Post Office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pose this question because of the confusion that is being created by statements from the Minister for Labour, the actions now by the Minister for Minerals and Energy and the statement on Tuesday by the Prime Minister: Is the Labor Government falling apart or is it trying to create confusion amongst the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> so that it can completely socialise industry in this country by a backdoor method? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-61-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must ask themselves whether it is good enough for vital industries of this nation to be under the control of a Minister who is so out of control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-5-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when great and vital national industries, the national interest and the well-being of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are placed in jeopardy by a marauding, uncontrolled and apparently uncontrollable Minister, the time has come for some pretty serious thinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-5-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That sort of logic might be all right in the councils of the Liberal Party, it might suit the comedian who is the temporary Premier of New South Wales, but it does not suit a responsible Australian Minister who has obligations to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and who takes them seriously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-5-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>expresses reservations with the establishment of a complex new Commonwealth instrumentality for which the Government was not given a mandate by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A social system that has this as one of its ingredients is a bad social system and, insofar as we have moved towards this situation, I believe that the standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the last few decades have not advanced but have regressed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the system the Country Party tries to foist on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 9 months that this Government has been in office its record in social welfare, administration, world affairs and presentation to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> stands unequalled in the annals of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let them remember this: This Government will continue along the course it is following, which the great majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> endorse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has diverted money from expenditure on defence and in other areas in which normally <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would expect it to be expended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that such a program can be sold to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that it is a reasonable and fair program for us to be putting forward, and that we members of this Parliament, irrespective of our political differences, should unite to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole that it is necessary to spend money at this time, and even more in the future, to bring about positive discrimination in this generation in order that there may be equality of opportunity in the next. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is true to say that this Parliament, particularly the previous Government, was not greatly interested in Aboriginals until 1967 when the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> expressed their opinion when asked in a referendum whether <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More than 80 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> said yes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had spoken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be further discussions between the Chief of the Air Staff and the people concerned and I am hopeful that we will be able to reach a satisfactory conclusion by which the Australian Government and the Royal Australian Air Force will be able to participate in what we regard as a major event in Australia, one in which I think most <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would want the Australian Government to co-operate and participate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation to which I draw attention is the very substantial call which is toeing made throughout the country for action to be taken in the other place to refuse supply to the Government and to override the House of Representatives - the only House which is elected by the whole of  the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate does not, because of its own resolution, represent all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that there will be no retreat by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from the commitment into which they entered last December for a new deal for the schools of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the kind of thing we decry and that is why we sought a mandate from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to give something like equality of opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is about time that the Prime Minister really put his foot down and told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> exactly where we are going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government from time to time elected, is the most effective voice of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and sometimes the only one they have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This desire for people to own their own homes is deeply seated in the majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, no matter what their incomes or backgrounds are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important that it is recognised that the urban policy of this country is apparently to be set by a man who has tonight stated that in future, if the referendum that is coming before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on 8 December is successful, and perhaps even if it is not successful, the Government will intervene to acquire arbitrarily and compulsorily not with the consent of the land owner, not with the consent of the householder, land in each of the capital cities, without a plan, without explaining what is to be done with the land, without announcing any basis of compensation, without people really knowing whether the land will be used or what will happen to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Parliament can survive only if the people elected to represent the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are given a reasonable opportunity of expressing a point of view on legislation which materially affects every Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I am asserting is that I do not believe him, and I do not believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believe him when he says these things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Oppositon are deluding themselves and attempting to delude the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> if they suggest that we do not already have very capable forces in being in relation to our own part of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>December 2nd of 1972 was a date on which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> decided it was time to review our defence policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mine will be a speech delivered by a member of the Australian Labor Party in support of legislation that was approved by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the time of the last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is not In the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that we should do nothing or limit our own powers in trying to hold our own a little more effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Industry Development Corporation Bill in its expanded form will provide the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with a much greater capacity to acquire equity and participation in Australian projects whether they be in the secondary, mining or tertiary areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter had the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in an election and it is impertinent of the Opposition to suggest that it will vote against both Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree - I think we all do - that it is basically desirable that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> retain as much control as possible over the country’s resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps more importantly, such provisions involve a compulsory mobilisation of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s money for objectives which are very much at the discretion of the Government - not parliament - and in which the people providing the money, the taxpayers, will have no say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether this scheme is a success or not will depend on how the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> receive it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill enables the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have a means of investment in Australian industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In opposing this Bill, the Opposition is denying to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a means not available to them at the moment to have a greater say in the ownership of Australian industry and also to enable the small investor to obtain capital growth and to share in the capital gains of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the widening of the powers of the Corporation, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be able to obtain such capital growth and, at the same time, help to develop secondary industry in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will support it when it is enacted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short I believe that instinctively the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want a liberal society and form of government and the system of free enterprise as the creative element in the production and exchange of goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will bung you out; give them another chance now - even you who live on your political life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want the institution of free enterprise to survive and continue its contribution to national greatness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After less than a year of this Government, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are sick of ministerial arrogance and contempt of public opinion and the illicit attempts to nationalise large elements of Australian industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill attempts to provide the means by which nationalisation of any Australian industry or business can be carried out without the precise approval of the Australian Parliament and without the knowledge or informed opinion of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, but at their expense through taxation and the temptation of subsidies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A power of this kind should be exercised only with the authority of a specific Act of the Parliament which has been freely debated in this House and in the media and which obviously has the approval of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are understandably sceptical about government intrusion into private enterprise and business, particularly when that business or enterprise is already being effectively conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are opposed to legislation by deceit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole situation is that the National Investment Fund, when established, will be used to invest in a wide variety of enterprises for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it should do so and I hope that when these Bills go to another place there will be a re-thinking of some of the attitudes expressed this afternoon in this chamber because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not thank any Opposition which does not take the opportunity to protect their vital interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it now wants to correct its early error by saying that we will do these things ourselves and offer incentives to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to invest in a governmentcontrolled corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have deferred approval for such farm-ins on the principle that the area belongs to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and if Woodside-Burmah is unable to fully explore it, it should surrender the area to the national Government, which can then either grant an exploration permit itself with an appropriate interest or itself undertake the exploration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our primary responsibility is to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First, the Minister says that the pipeline authority must secure control of and retain reserves of petroleum adequate to meet the long-term needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> fall for the policies of the Liberals they will have no fuel in their cars and no heating in their houses within the next 5 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is initiation of war by a group of countries or by one country I think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> deserve to be told the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am more than ever convinced that a prices and incomes power in the hands of a Labor government would be administered contrary to the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear to me that the Opposition does not want to debate these Bills constructively; in fact it only wants to use the time to misrepresent the meaning of the Bills and to give a distorted impression of the Bills to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You are the sort of people that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not trust and that is why you are sitting on that side of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the Opposition wishes to deny the ordinary <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the opportunity to share in the benefits of the capital growth of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not need a week to debate whether we want to side with big business and financial institutions or to give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the right to participate in the economic growth of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But those funds are not being put to the uses that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> require. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in such cases as the investments of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in, for example, business that would usually be done with the life offices, there could be no objection whatsoever to the Government auditor doing the auditing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the great majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be much happier if we had a public interest in the great national resources of this country; if we had a public interest in uranium and the eventual setting up of- - The  CHAIRMAN  - I ask the Minister to come back to the clause, otherwise he will be opening the matter much wider. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we do not believe that we should put into the hands of one man, one organisation or one government the powers that are comprised within this clause of the new Bill which could do great harm to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then proceeded some years later, I think in 1958, to rail against the previous administration for holding citizenship conventions which were designed to soften up the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to admit Asians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot accept that proposition and I do not think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want to accept it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that if the Government acted in accordance with the motion which has been moved by the right honourable member for Higgins, it would bring down on Australia a further advance of the permissive society that is so destroying the fabric of the moral rectitude of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have already clearly indicated that whilst they are happy and satisfied with the general private enterprise nature of the economy, they want to see a properly constituted public authority express a little more power and a little more competitive influence in this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Industry Development Corporation Bill, followed toy the 1970 Bill, was drafted in a way that would be to the best advantage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, would not cause dislocation in the  money market and would not cause the misappropriation or misallocation of resources, which in turn would reduce productivity and affect the standards of living of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems alarming to me that without any will on the part of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> seeking this change this legislation should be introduced and the National Investment Fund established in an unfair and competitive way, to the detriment of contributors to the Australian life offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way that this sort of capital can be raised is by the subscriptions of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, by companies, by life offices and by pension schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to realise, and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have to realise, that they now have life offices which can in fact invest their money for these purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is claimed that it has not, that is an indictment of the Parliament, and of the Press, and of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless I say that this House should reject this Bill because the proposal it embodies will reduce the standing and authority of the Parliament; it will remove from the Government and the Parliament responsibilities which should be theirs, and it will place those responsibilities in the hands of an extremely powerful central planning authority which I believe will not have the capacity to make the kinds of decisions which will be in the interests of the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - the kinds of decisions which only elected governments can and should make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: the House is of the opinion that the Bill should not be proceeded with until the autumn sittings in 1974 so that the deep study required to make possible an appreciation of the full implications of the Bill can occur and so that, should the Parliament then decide to support the Bill, it will be possible to place before the House amendments which will make the Bill more acceptable and the proposals it contains more likely to serve the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Put the 2 things together and let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> be the judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was always the policy of the Australian Labor Party to use the tariff to promote the economic growth of Australia, to diversify Australian industry, to raise the incomes of wage earners, and to do this by transferring to secondary industry part of the wealth deriving from that asset which, despite any differences in title - leasehold or freehold - still remains primarily the property of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole, namely, the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an attempt also to give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> access to decisions in relation to their taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the refusal by the New South Wales Government to exercise its constitutional authority to control prices, what action can be taken by the Australian Government to protect consumers until such time as the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> grant such authority to this Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I express the appreciation of the Government and I believe of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that  Mr Justice  Moore, now the  President  of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, performed the basic pioneering work in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like in this case, too, to express the appreciation of the Government and, I am sure, of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the Tribunal’s careful inquiry and report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to pay a tribute to the Tariff Board system which has served us so well in secondary industry and has given us the guidance that we needed to get an independent judgment and which has given the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the opportunity to hear public evidence and see the public reports thereon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we start again to analyse those very wise words of a man that was held in very great regard by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> we stop and think. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Minister for the Environment and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  and the Whitlam Administration are taking the most positive determined steps by the creation of the very ministry which the distinguished Minister holds to arouse even more the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s need to support the Government and the Department which is determined to protect the natural environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That will be done in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a group of mediocrity which has failed the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are fed up with this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are afraid of where this Government is going to take them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want the Government out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would welcome an election on 8 December along with the referendum proposals, and the Opposition parties would likewise welcome it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government lacks the confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and it ought to lack the confidence of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker,  the whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will understand why there has been such an air of uncertainty and unreality in Australian politics for the last fortnight, because we first heard a fortnight ago that this motion of no confidence was going to be moved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be less than usually frank with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> if I did not confess to the apprehension with which I would enter upon a campaign against the Leader of the Opposition, because he has had 2 weeks to prepare this speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will then be asked whether all the things that the right honourable gentleman has said today, what various people who get a guernsey will say later today or what they have said over recent months is the view of the Australian Government, the view of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> or would be the view of any alternative Australian government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There, too, 1 shall have to waste valuable time apologising for the Leader of the Opposition, giving assurances that he does not represent the other half of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> or the Liberal Party or, at least, its best and not indecent part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Come clean with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rest, my Party rests, my Government rests upon a great faith in the memory and intelligence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not want the Liberals back - certainly not in their unredeemed, unforgotten unforgiven, leaderless state, and certainly not with, what they have to offer as the leaders of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Leader of the Opposition has this morning devastated the Government with an annihilating list of issues on which it has completely fallen down in its duty to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has earned the contempt and the distrust of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for its inept management of the nation’s affairs and the general state of uncertainty, worry and fear that it has created. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not one Labomember will show the conviction to stand up and admit that the Caucus system has dumped in this nation’s lap a collection of Ministers who have seriously damaged Australia’s standing in the eyes of many nations, who have so antagonised, insulted and sabotaged industry of all kinds that there is an almost complete breakdown in communications between industry and the Government, and who have alienated the goodwill which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were prepared to extend to a new and untried Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This overwhelming wave of public bitterness and fear prompted my Party to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> quite clearly and unequivocally where we stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are naive enough to believe, apparently, that they can convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the existence of a gigantic and sinister plot to overthrow the Labor Government and place Australia under the control of nasty foreign multi-national corporations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want from their Prime Minister is not simply purple prose and rhetoric, not personal abuse and diatribe, not a vaudeville performance in this Parliament, but a serious attempt to come to grips with the problems facing Australia, and this he has been unprepared to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that this Minister no longer has the confidence of the industry, the House or the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and in the interests of this country’s future development clearly he should resign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not be fooled by the anti-democratic procedures which have been adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The carping criticism, the destructive criticism of the Government’s actions without one single positive suggestion as to how current economic problems may be overcome is useless and will gain no support from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The plan was to reduce the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the position of being unprotected tenants in their own country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition, who was then the Treasurer - the architect behind and the man responsible for that disaster - has the gall and the nerve to try to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that this Government is responsible for a loss in production of some 860,000 working days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Opposition succeeds in misleading some of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and we suffer the consequences of that, we will accept that too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition today says that this Government does not have the confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not be fooled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eightynine per cent of the capital infrastructure that was needed to develop Australia was supplied by <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from their savings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He actually had the audacity to attack the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor)  for what he is doing to preserve the natural heritage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a policy would, I believe, be unacceptable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for the very good reason that in a country as geographically extensive as Australia, the Federal system is the best. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ideological catchcries of the past - the images of gigantic hordes assailing our shores from the north, although employed with a blatant appeal to naked fear prior to the general election in December by all 3 conservative parties, and having been a successful tactic during their 23 years of government - did not succeed in persuading the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on 8 December give the Australian Parliament the power to make laws with respect to incomes, the Australian Parliament will be able to legislate to introduce periodic cost of living adjustments to wages and salaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Parliament is supposed to service the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that either we members or the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should have to wait so long for an adequate building to house the functions of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not detain the Committee for long, although I believe that what I am to say is, if not in itself tremendously important, at least deals with the most important subject before this Parliament, namely, the security of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This attitude bewilders many of our friends and old allies and again and again one is asked overseas: ‘Are the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> really like that, or are the Australian masses really like that?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was very odd to visit Paris and to be asked by so many people in France: ‘Is it true that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> like the Communist Chinese more than they like the French, or is it that they are just a little hypocritical in their attitudes to bombs?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The South Vietnamese want to know whether the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want the communist aggressors to win. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members opposite think that their foreign policy is right and if they think all their other policies are right, why do they not give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the opportunity to show what they think of what the Government is doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government when they were in Opposition last year making a regular practice when they were abroad of criticising the Australian Government and, ipso facto, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who elected that Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members opposite went to New York and criticised the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is no wonder there are those who would attempt to deny the democratic wishes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last December the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> voted for a change of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> knew that any new government would inherit massive problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the men who wish to deny the Government trying to run the country and cause great suffering and disadvantage to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in their wish or hope for power motivated only by unprincipled opportune political gain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has already announced that the question of local government representation at the Australian Loan Council will be put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for decision by way of a referendum in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has happened is that the members of the Country Party are trying to paint a false picture, but what concerns me about these sectional gentlemen is that they are giving the impression to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, who are mostly in the cities, that the currency of protest has been so debased that no one from the countryside can be believed in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Australian Government is perpetrating a gigantic hoax and confidence trick on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by not including in that poll the present national anthem ‘God Save the Queen’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the poll is conducted as outlined in this Press release the Government will then say that one of those 3 songs is obviously the preference of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when this could easily not be the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are used to this Government pulling shabby tricks but this is something which will have a great number of ramifications for <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that it is a shabby trick not to include in the poll the present national anthem because if it is not included the results of the poll cannot truly be said accurately to reflect the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not wish to speak for long on this matter but I do believe that I speak for an enormous number of Australians when I say that if this Government wants truly to find out the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in relation to this important matter - it is an emotional matter and which impinges upon the feelings of all Australians - it should in all conscience give to them the opportunity of a full choice of a national anthem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only point I am making is that it is quite obvious that apple juice is not as palatable to <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as is orange juice, apricot juice, pineapple juice, mixed juices and a wide variety of other juices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will let the Minister squeak his little answer on another occasion because he knows very well that he was guilty of the biggest display of malpractice and of putting a fact to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> which I doubt he had any intention of honouring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman seems to have the impression, or would convey the impression to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that it was not until 2 December 1972 that there was any industrial trouble in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important also that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should know the extent of the Prime Minister’s commitment as an emissary explaining China’s policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The energy industries do not know and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> certainly do not know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to know the facts, to know the choices before them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are paying to protect monopolies which we in this Government feel should be called to account when they abuse their protective privileges given by the Australian Government and paid for by the Australian taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is of urgent and vital importance to the great majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill clearly divides this Parliament into 2 groups: Those who support adequate protection for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and those who represent the interests of the monopolies and other big business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not be terribly impressed by listening to some kind of a giant multi-national ventriloquist act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once having taken notice of them, I hope the Government will realise that this Bill can have disastrous consequences and that it is not in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It substituted instead a weak and emasculated Bill that virtually amounted to a fraud and deception on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in that it gave the impression of controlling trade practices but in fact did precious little about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However to rigidly link the two would reduce the ability of the Government to attune its policies to match developing circumstances and the changing needs and desires of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-18">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the ruling of the Supreme Court in South Australia means that if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> give the Whitlam Government power to control prices they will thereby give it power to control wages, irrespective of the outcome of the wages question in the referundum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet the Minister constantly repeats, to reassure himself that he is right when he knows that he is .abusing the English language and abusing the facts and statistics, that it will cost less for the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am just saying that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have the right to know the sorts of things that are done and the sorts of things that are paid for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite frankly, what went on in the past in relation to many of these matters was less than desirable as far as the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Opposition does not approve a whole system of upgrading to serve the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In other words, purchasing in bulk, as is done by discount stores, is anti-inflationary and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are the beneficiaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are the ones who will benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to the discredit of the present Opposition that in its long period of office in government it did not do something for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as far as consumer legislation is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am confident they will have the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have always said that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ought to be looking for a 2-party system made up of the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party, although we disagree with the policies of that Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the great myths and legends of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is that there are always tremendous numbers of other people standing by, knocking on the door for entry to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This year the truth is that the Australian Labor Party, which claimed there would be less industrial disturbance when it was in government because it had a special arrangement with the trade unions, has been completely incapable of delivering that promise to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, John McEwen House was erected after a great deal of bard work had been done by thousands of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who had tremendous admiration for the dedication and ability of  Sir John  McEwen here in the national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to the Minister who has just asked whether I was the fund raiser, I have just said that John McEwen House was erected as a result of the hard work of thousands of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from both rural and city areas alike who respected the job that  Sir John  McEwen had done for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the common sense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will assert itself and that even the workers in the building industry will see that the union leaders have been misleading them and organising them to operate against their own real interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  remarks were just like the pre-election speech made last year by the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  who misrepresented to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the position of the Australian Labor Party in regard to many fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is confident that the vast majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will co-operate in the simple processes involved in administering the Health Insurance Program on an economic and efficient basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people who are associated with health care in Australia were prepared to come forth to debate and discuss the matter sensibly and to give up a great deal of their time to see whether this health scheme, whilst it may not have been exactly what they would have chosen themselves, was something that would be to the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I think the first thing that should concern the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is that in most countries, certainly in most Western developing countries, the costs of health services are taking too much of the national resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These elements, who prostitute the capitalist enterprise system to the detriment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and tarnish the reputation of the majority of fine, reputable physicians, have managed to delay the introduction of a comprehensive universal medical insurance scheme since the first attempts by the Bruce-Page Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point that the honourable member mentioned, and one that the Minister harps on continuously, is the small percentage of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who are not covered by present health benefit schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be, otherwise it would not be distributing literature which purports to represent a democratic and just point of view to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but which, in essence, is an exercise in deception as it misleads, confuses and frightens people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know it does not happen, yet they insist on putting this view before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Strangely enough we have never been able to get across the message of our economic success to prove to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the degree of that success and what it meant to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had an argument this morning about whether 87 per cent of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were covered by health insurance or whether 92 per cent were covered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We claim that this is a deliberate misrepresentation of the mandate that the Government says it has from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who, in their customary habit, send greetings via Christmas cards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Prime Minister explain how the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should distinguish between a Minister’s personal views and expressions of the Government’s official views? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government thinks it can use bulldozer tactics in this Parliament and then obtain the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> it will be very surprised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, in view of the way I correctly described the long title, the long title which will be put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on the ballot paper is a fraud. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been told that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have voting fatigue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I believe that we are deceiving ourselves if we think that because of voting fatigue the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will surrender any part of the democratic tradition of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the chance to decide what shall be the laws of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those honourable members directly opposite, representing much less than 50 per cent of the Australian electorate, and those who sit in the corner of the House, representing less than 10 per cent of the electorate, now have decided that they, the minority parties in this country, will not let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have even a vote on a measure of such great importance to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation lays down a pattern for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, giving them the opportunity to decide to bring together the elections for both parliaments for the lifetime of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, we have those people opposite who call themselves democrats telling the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that they do not even trust them to vote on the measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will put a fair case from this side of the House to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and, if this is to be the case, the Leader of the Opposition can put the negative case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that they will be carried when presented to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result was that in that period elections cost the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> say another $7m because the Senate and House of Representatives elections were not held in conjunction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no doubt in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Labor Party, in its machinations of power, seeks, through this legislation as a first step, to try to destroy some of the power which is now exercised by the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are unlikely to be hoodwinked by the sorts of arguments that have been presented to this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I implore the Government that, if it is to be taken seriously in its wish to alter the Constitution for the good of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and not for the good of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Opposition are ashamed because they will not let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> decide the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will not let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> hear the various views on the matter and express their own opinion on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only in the Parliament do they oppose it, but also outside the Parliament they seek to prevent the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from having a say on these issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Prime Minister agree that legislation designed to eventually change the Australian  Constiution  is legislation of considerable significance and that if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are to be asked to express an informed and considered view on the proposals to change the Constitution, the Parliament should have adequate time to debate the legislation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Prime Minister, in the interest of ensuring that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are allowed to be made aware of the great ramifications of the 2 Bills still under discussion in this House, reconsider, even at this late stage, the decision to use the guillotine, recognising that the matter involves much more than the simple proposition put to us by the Leader of the House that all we are being asked to do is to let the people decide? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would think that if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> wished to change their form of Constitution from a federal to a unitary system, the right way to do this would be for a government to come out and state plainly what it wished to do, give the arguments in favour of what it wished to do and finally, by referendum, put it to the people instead of seeking to do it by stealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was stirred up for the simple reason that the Prime Minister announced that we would have a poll of a handful of people - less than one-half of one per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will get a voice on this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am a supporter of a Government which realises the problems of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, a Government to whom the burdened heart may pour forth its sorrows, to whom distress may prefer its suit, whose head is guided by justice and whose heart at all times is expanded by benevolence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So, every Australian has the right to vote and the 2 Houses - the House of Representatives and the Senate - are chosen by the direct vote of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is taking upon ourselves the idea of authoritarianism in Canberra, the like of which was not intended by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at any time of their history, and I am sure it will not be their intention in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To give powers by the Constitution which were given in the Constitution at Federation is to pretend that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not understand and are foolish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He seeks to deny this Parliament the right to ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to determine whether individual citizens’ rights should be guaranteed in respect of the election of members of all parliaments throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On no occasion since Federation have the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> been given such a clear opportunity to gain effective and permanent control of the Australian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will also give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the first opportunity since colonial days to end the cynical manipulation of political power in certain of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us see whether the Leader of the Country Party is now prepared to back up his earlier statement and support this proposition to give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the opportunity to express their views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No amount of cunning or attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian electorate will succeed in deceiving the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on this occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pettifogging arguments that have been advanced so far against this far-reaching and basic proposition will not convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that they should not take the steps which will put the gerrymandering of electorates beyond the reach of those who seek a political advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are tired of being manipulated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it any wonder that they oppose giving to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the right to have a say as to whether there should be equal representation, whether there should be upheld in this country the concept of one vote having equal value to another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also a provision in this Bill which seeks to give to the High Court of Australia power of original jurisdiction, power to exercise a control over manipulation of Australian electorates, a power which will be a safeguard, a sentinel, on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No matter how much the Leader of the Australian Country Party may try to divert this debate and no matter how much the Leader of the Opposition may try to pull the wool over the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and, by pettifogging arguments, try to confuse the issue, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not be fooled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter what obstructionist tactics are adopted by the Liberal-Country Party in this House, the Constitution provides that the matter can still go before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Nothing is more fundamental to our parliamentary system and to our way of life than the very great questions that are now being brought before this Parliament and that will eventually be put before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This time he wants the Parliament to ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole to approve at a referendum a change in the Australian Constitution to give an advantage to the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was passed twice in this chamber in an attempt to give equality of voting to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, but decadent old men in the other chamber, comprising mainly the rump of the Liberal Party, decided that they would not allow the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have equitable voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it fair to say that until the Prime Minister tells us about the staffing arrangements of Ministers, which he has promised this Parliament to do but has not done, the people of Australia are entitled to know who these faceless men are who are not elected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but who cover up for Ministers in every way possible at huge public expense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want changes of the kind proposed in clause 2 (c) of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 2 (c) is an attempt to whittle away the federal system and the powers of the States; to take away power from the sovereign people of this country; to do so without adequate consideration of the meaning of the words and the consequences of the proposed change; to do so in such a way as to prevent proper public discussion; to do so by stealth; and to prevent the referendum Bill from truly reflecting the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the years, the demands of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to update their ageing Constitution have been frustrated by the over-rigid requirements which must be met before change can occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would not only mean that the referendum result would be more democratic, it would also give a better national reflection of the views of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All this legislation does is to seek the approval of the Parliament to give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the right to say whether their fellow men and women in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, including Jervis Bay, shall have the right to exercise their vote in referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would be very little difficulty in having the votes of Territorians registered and included in the overall vote of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not being informed of the actual purport of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is not informing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; it is misrepresenting the case not in the name of the Bill but in the form in which it has introduced the question in clause 2 (c). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sooner or later it will sink into the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that that is exactly what he is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to speak on this Bill because it is symptomatic of the type of legislation which this Government is bringing forward and, as has been mentioned by several other speakers on this side of the House, it seeks to mislead the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To seek to alter that Constitution in a manner which is not clearcut is, in my view, a clear attempt to deceive the people because when this matter comes before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for a vote there is nothing in the title of the Bill which refers to the 2 ways in which the Constitution is proposed to be altered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite certain that a majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be fully in agreement with the idea that all Australian electors should have the opportunity of voting in referenda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This goes to prove, I believe, that when the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> really wish to see an alteration to the Constitution they have no trouble in voting to achieve that end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were in favour of the question relating to Aborigines but were against breaking the nexus between the 2 Houses of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only would this in my mind be a more reasonable way, a more honest way, a more direct way and a more clear cut way of presenting the alternative propositions to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but also it would probably have the very real effect of giving the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the opportunity of voting in favour of the measure proposing a constitutional change to give electors in the Territories the opportunity to vote at a referendum and also to express their opinion on the second proposal contained in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It always strikes me as a sad and quaint thing that the Australian Labor Party rails so much against the ‘inherent conservatism of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’ and that it rails against the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for only being decent enough to pass 5 referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What it fails to see is that this is a measure very often of the wisdom of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the basic good sense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, who are healthy disrespecters of government and who, if they are healthy disrespecters of all government, are particularly healthy disrespecters of Canberra based government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are healthy disrespecters, as <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, of big government, because they are basic respecters of the rights of individual people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, the Australian Country Party completely supports that part of the Bill which ensures that there will be a vote for electors within the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory at referenda which will subsequently be submitted to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> need to take note of the degree to which that is the significant motivation which leads the Government to present this Bill to the House at this time, rather than any genuine concern about making constitutional change simpler and easier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said at the beginning of my speech, one can only wonder at the enormous persuasive capacity of our predecessors 80 years ago who managed to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - I suppose there were people like honourable members opposite representing them then - to federate into one nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, if honourable members read Quick and Garran and understand the constitutional principles and the realities of a federal and democratic system that guided the fathers of the Constitution, they must come to the conclusion that before a referendum is put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> they must be informed of exactly what is involved in the proposed change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is proposed in the Bill would not be in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that we should go to any great lengths to facilitate changes unless there is a clear and unmistakable expression of opinion on the part of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who are themselves qualified to vote - the people of this country in whom the sovereign or quasi-sovereign power resides - that a change is necessary or desirable or unless the Government has clearly and honestly come to the conclusion that these qualified people themselves desire that an amendment to the Constitution be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, it is a false presentation, and that presentation should be altered not only in the interests of accuracy and justice but also to permit the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to know exactly what is contemplated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are now entitled to express their view on this long-standing, well-founded, factual proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion, one of the main things for which the Minister for Defence  (Mr Barnard)  is to be congratulated are the steps he has taken to restore sanity to the discussion of defence matters in Australia and thus create a situation where fear and deception can never again be used to mislead the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for the narrow interests of a conservative government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The calm and rational defence analyses instigated by the Minister for Defence and his explanation of these to the Australian public has done much to consolidate the awareness of these developments amongst the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, although its long term importance has been overlooked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I believe that the bulk of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are fast coming to see the difference between sane and logical argument, and hysterical outbursts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that the present Minister for Defence has been able to do a great deal to foster this new awareness amongst the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In two major statements to this House and many other speeches around the country he has explained not only the strategic situation but has done much to show the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the means by which the current situation and possible future developments are assessed so that our defences can be rationally planned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard the speech the Minister gave to the RSL National Conference of the 29th October has a significance beyond what was said since, for the first time, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were taken into the Government’s confidence on basic matters of defence planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hollow rhetoric which in the past has been delivered as an excuse for defence policy will never again be acceptable to <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and future governments, of whatever colour, will have to explain far more fully the reasons which have led them to adopt defence policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In future, only such carefully reasoned arguments will be acceptable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who have, under this Government, witnessed for the first time what defence policy debate is really supposed to be like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking back over the record of this Government in its 11 months in office, I believe that there can be no basis for criticism by the Opposition or by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> regarding our actions on defence matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any one of those 3 positions can be taken by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but as far as I am concerned a man who is a Minister, if he is unsuccessful in Cabinet, cannot say that he presented some alternative point of view and really is sympathetic to the rural industries, because it just is not a fact under our Cabinet system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can recall cheap wheat for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for 6s 8d per bushel when the overseas price was approximately 1 per bushel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only thing that stops this principle being visited on other sections of the community today is the fact that this Government made a promise to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - I will deal later on in my speech with other promises - that it would not raise personal income tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that the question comes very ill from the honourable member because he was one of the Ministers who, over recent years, donated $400m to the search for oil and petrol in this country, mainly to foreign companies and left the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with not one cent of equity to show for that largesse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was a document singularly lacking in courage, populist in outlook and conceived with the intention of pleasing the Labor Caucus and its supporters rather than seeking the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Government must assume complete responsibility for its fiscal and budget policies, and their consequences, and for other policies of a kind which are continuously affecting the confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Government must accept complete responsibility for the change in the feelings of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and their decision when next an election is held, and I hope it is pretty soon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However to rigidly link the two would reduce the ability of the Government to attune its policies to match developing circumstances and the changing needs and desires of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-31-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Prime Minister make it clear beyond doubt to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the world that the policies of the Government are those stated and carried out by the Government, and not by the political head of the Government Party- that is, the  President  of the ALP? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If one examines the increasing expenditure on education undertaken by succeeding Liberal-Country Party coalition governments at the Federal level from 1962 onwards, one can see that not only the present Government but also previous governments reflected an increasing concern by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the upgrading of education, no matter where in Australia it was taking place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This program is an indication of the enthusiasm and earnestness of the Interim Committee in tackling its responsibilities, and indicates the wholehearted approach and the concern for the health care of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Commission will bring to bear on its tasks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Look, the Prime Minister is quite wrong and he is quite deliberately forgetting the undertakings which he gave to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> prior to the last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He thinks that he can bluff the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Opposition on this issue, believing that it might be the thing on which he can win an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his speech which opened the election campaign and which persuaded the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to vote for the Australian Labor Party the Prime Minister said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The circumstances of their election had nothing to do with what led the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to elect the Labor Government to office last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite have called upon their majority in the Senate, in the most undemocratic way possible, to thwart, frustrate and sabotage what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> thought they were electing, that is, a political party which had a better education policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we simply seek to do is to put before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the promises made by the members of this Government when they were in Opposition last year and seek to hold them to those promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As we have overcome other difficulties so the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> has been directed to the importance of the urban environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of this emerging consciousness by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as to the importance of urban development we have seen increasing attention paid to the policies of governments - national, State and local - in ensuring that the environment is developed in an orderly fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What encouragement have the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> received over the last 12 months of Labor government to believe in any promises or vague statements of honourable members opposite? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that in the course of this debate we have been able to rouse the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the dangers of voting Yes, Yes to give these powers to a Government that does nothing but think in terms of vague slogans while it is after the people’s vote and then puts the boot in afterwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his policy speech last November, the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  said that the Australian Labor Party was determined that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be restored to their rightful place in their own country, as the owners and keepers of the national estate, and the nation’s resources, and as fair and equal sharers in the national wealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the present situation of serious and worsening shortages of goods of all kinds, the worst possible thing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can do on Saturday is give the Government power to control prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While I believe that a Constitution such as ours must always be regarded as a document that is dynamic, alive and capable of being changed to meet the changing environment, changing economic and social circumstances, a changing culture, changes in our international status and relations and the growth of a greater national spirit, I do not believe that changes should be made to it unless such changes have received mature consideration by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly it has the approval of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in relation to a number of things which it said it would want to do, but that does not mean to say that it has a mandate and can use that claim to support the precise manner in which it wants to carry out certain pretty general policy proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand the application of standing order 250 and the procedure which the Prime Minister is adopting, the Prime Minister is seeking to pre-empt any opportunity of parliamentary debate on an important constitutional matter on which the Government wishes the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to vote at a Commonwealth referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is the case  -  1 am subject to correction across the table - what the Government does of course is allow no opportunity for the Opposition parties to debate the Bill in depth again and in fact force this matter on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he does agree with Professor Gruen on these matters, will he say so now so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be aware of the dangers of price control before they vote on Saturday? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Like all academic economists in Australia, and I believe the overwhelming majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, he believes that the national Parliament in Australia should have the jurisdication to make laws on prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If anything is to be done about prices and incomes policies in this country, it will be done on the initiative of the national Parliament, armed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with the necessary contemporary economic power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will be remind the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that even after the referendum is carried, despite the deception by people handing out how to vote cards on behalf of but not in the name of the Liberal and Country Parties, no item will be subject to price control until appropriate legislation is subsequently passed by both Houses of this Australian Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That, in the opinion of this House, Australia’s National Anthem should not be changed without a total vote of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on suggested alternative anthems including ‘God Save The Queen’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That, in the opinion of this House, Australia’s National Anthem should not be changed without a total vote of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on suggested alternative anthems including ‘God Save The Queen’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It specifically leaves that question to be answered by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most especially it does not attempt to impose upon all the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> an anthem chosen by a possibly unrepresentative minority - in addition a choice made without the opportunity of voting for the present Australian anthem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The choice of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, not the musical tastes of George II, should determine Australia’s National Anthem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not wish to comment on the 3 suggested alternatives, except to say that I find it extraordinary that a national contest was held, more than 1,000 entries were received; they were judged in almost obscene haste, and not one was considered good enough to put before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - an absolutely extraordinary situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, to obtain a true indication of the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and not simply the will of the Government, the present anthem must be included in the choices offered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not seek to delve into the nationalism or otherwise of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That can be tested only by a full vote of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, with the opportunity of expressing an opinion on the present anthem being given to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This House should make abundantly clear to the Government that it will not tolerate the arbitrary imposition of a national anthem on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The satisfaction of one man’s ego should be submerged and the genuine expression of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be allowed to declare itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there is no doubt about the way in which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally are feeling at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is really something that we have determined to do and the overwhelming number of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want us to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is rejected by honourable members opposite then that is their choice, but as far as I and the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are concerned I think the effort that has been made by the Prime Minister in conformity with his promise made at Griffith 12 days before the last election should be commended and we will implement it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All that the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar),  who moved this motion, and I, as the seconder, ask is that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> be consulted on this matter of importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many matters on which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are to be consulted by way of referendum both this coming Saturday and in the future at enormous cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when we move into an area of emotional feeling, such as is involved with a national anthem, I feel that the people are interested and concerned and that they ought to be consulted in the same way as they are to be consulted on these other matters which the Labor Government considered important to it, but which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> probably will not consider to be very important at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, in the opinion of this House, Australia’s national anthem should not be changed without a total vote of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on suggested alternative anthems including ‘God Save the Queen’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It refers to a total vote of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing in his motion to that effect, if we support this motion today we would be voting to require a total vote of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to decide the question - that is, every man, woman and child in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They want to spend $2m of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s money to have a referendum on an anthem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 26 January the Prime Minister announced that the public would be invited to submit entries for the words and music for a new national anthem and that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be consulted in the final choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has suggested that alternative anthems should be considered and put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who will decide which ones will be submitted to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in many cases, such a ballot paper would not be understood by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would that not appeal to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motion moved by the honourable member for Warringah deserves to be treated with a certain amount of ridicule because it is an impossible proposal embracing, as it does, every man, woman and child voting on every suggestion - good, bad or indifferent - which will be presented to and decided on by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at tremendous cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The action that has been taken is carrying out an unmistakable mandate given by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We oppose it, not with any disrespect to  Her  Majesty or to the anthem but because we believe in a really Australian way of life and we believe in an Australian anthem for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We propose to have an Australian anthem for an <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motion that we ‘are discussing asks this House to express the opinion that the Australian national anthem should not be changed without a total vote of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motion advocates that this should be done by a total vote of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, in other words,, by a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point involved in the motion is that among the alternative anthems included for the decision of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be ‘God Save the Queen’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The departure from what has happened for 200 years is a matter of enormous consequence and there could be not doubt in the mind of any sensible person that ‘God Save the Queen’ should be one of the choices for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is so, he chose a pretty good tune, anyway, and I would not substitute that choice with the Prime Minister’s choice, nor do I think that half the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would substitute that choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in their colonies and since Federation as well have accepted ‘God Save the Queen’ for 200 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>God Save the Queen’ is established, and it should not be disestablished except by a vote of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Practical benefits could flow to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> through such avenues as forestry, agriculture, pharmacy, recreation and aesthetics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr CHIPP (Hotham) N(2.47)- We are presently debating 2 Bills concerning health care for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> which the Labor Government hopes will become Acts of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We oppose the scheme simply and sincerely for the reason that we believe that if implemented it would be bad for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and therefore I move as an amendment to the Bill: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government says: To hell with the ex pressed wishes of 90 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to be covered voluntarily by a health insurance fund of their own choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is high time we stopped wasting our effort on this illconsidered, counter-productive, ramshackle and wasteful Labor health scheme, and got down to the real task which this Government is evading - how to improve the standard of health care of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this Government, with the clear mandate given to it by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> last December, will carry on with its responsibility to bring universal health care to all Australians and to remove from our society forever the fear of illness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the most celebrated frauds, among a host of frauds, perpetrated on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is trying to hoodwink the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into a policy of help that completely denies freedom of choice and freedom of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has begun to realise that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, most of whom have found the existing scheme completely satisfactory, have risen up in anger as they have come to understand more clearly the implications of the Government’s intentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because the Government has become conscious of the fact that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have seen through its barrage of propaganda that it has been frightened into throwing the public a bone in the form of the so-called White Paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the record of this Minister and this Government over the last 12 months, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be extremely unwise to listen to or to heed reassuring noises of any description. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everything else followed, particularly the large degree of uniformity, government control and dragging everybody and everything down to the lowest level which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have found so objectionable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should know the true reason why the Opposition is trying to prevent the enactment of the health insurance program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They could examine, as the Queensland Government is going to examine, the penalties for crimes of violence and have a look at the possibility of deterrents, because it is in that area that the greatest service can be rendered to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The referendum result on Saturday disclosed very good common sense on the part of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We proposed positive policies, and there can be no doubt that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> decided that we should get on with the job by adopting positive policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sooner it gets on with that job, the better it will be for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want the policy set out so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - the States and the consumers - can know what it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increase is likely to be much more than that and the consequence is that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will pay over $400m extra in direct income tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present rate of income tax is becoming so repressive that it is taking away all incentive from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot pass a law which says that there shall be no more inflation; one must go about this problem and formulate positive policies in respect of which the whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will co-operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, there has been no policy statement or recognition by the Government of the decision of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the honourable member for Scullin, who is a doctor, suggest that this is not an issue in which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are interested? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has shamed his profession by saying that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not interested in a debate on a matter that affects every person in Australia with respect to their health and health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this side of the House, we believe that subject to be a matter of ultimate importance as the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> showed on Saturday last in their distrust of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that we keep these questions in mind, because I believe the vast majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> recognise the existing scheme for what it is: One of the best, if not the best, in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will lose the services which they clearly believe the private and religious hospitals offer and which the people want and are entitled to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot support proposals for a scheme which would reduce the quality of health care, and which would - despite the Minister’s denials - take away the freedom of choice which we believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot support proposals which will lead to the taking away from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of their right to choose, if they wish, to enter private and religious hospitals instead of public hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is too simplistic to believe that a change in funding arrangements will automatically change the health care expectations of the great majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> now know the alternatives before them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> repudiated them for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the three years between those elections, we had the chance to develop our policies further and to explain them in greater detail to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> heeded those words. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, such powers are no more extensive than those which already exist in the case of the trading banks and the Government regards it as essential that the powers be available if it is to be in a position to exercise a fully effective monetary policy in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is time that the Government realised that it is on the wrong foot completely and that the people of this country, and of the world, will not put up with this parochial attitude of trying not to find petroleum products for the use of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said that $400m odd has been invested by the taxpayer in one form or another, such as taxation foregone and so on, and the question was asked: ‘What have the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, got out of it?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one puts these figures together as has been done by an accountant friend of mine, an income tax rate of 47.5 per cent, plus the royalty payments, gives the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - the taxpayer - about an 80 per cent return on their investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this basis the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> vote for us or vote against us but when they elect us to office we are entitled to incorporate any of that principle outlined in that policy document into legislative form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are starting to look beyond that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was inevitable because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> expect their growing sense of national identity to be expressed in the increased control and ownership of their natural resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Australian Country Party, at least, in the past has had some men of vision, some good Australians, who made sure that these pieces of public enterprise remained and were not dismantled as a previous Australian asset in the oil field - the 50 per cent ownership of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in Commonwealth Oil Refineries - was dismantled in 1952 by the Menzies’ Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today we have here an opportunity for an Australian enterprise to be set up on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for some wonderful purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Blaxland has said, we will be happy to go to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to show just how Australian in outlook members opposite are in opposing the concepts of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They realise also the scandal of the expenditure of $4 19m of taxpayers’ funds in this industry with not one share of ownership in our resources belonging to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will be proud to go out on to the hustings to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that $4 19m of their funds has been squandered without one share being offered to them and that when we attempted to do something about that situation by way of the Bill now before us the mouthpieces of business stopped us from doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a benefit which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have obtained by having a 68 per cent self sufficiency in oil production, thereby not having to import crude from overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is no good the present Government, in a fit of self satisfied smugness, telling the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that they have no fear of petrol rationing or that Australia has 68 per cent self sufficiency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> need to realise that this Government is denying to them the opportunity to sustain their way of life in an, energy hungry world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think this Bill will go down in history as something to which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been looking forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have waited in vain for a government that would speak out for this nation and ensure that the resources of the nation were husbanded, preserved and used for the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill sets out in detail to cover the various aspects of petroleum and minerals and assures the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the welfare of this nation will not be neglected and that we will not sell out our resources to foreign powers merely for a mess of pottage to meet a current situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We hear the timid squeaks of members of the Opposition, fearful that something terrible will happen merely because the Australian Government has stood up for the Austraiian people and is to assert the control of a section of our resources for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was an endeavour, at the last moment, on the day before the referendum vote, to deceive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, whether because of this letter from the economists or for some other reason, saw through the Prime Minister; they saw through what the Government was trying to do at the referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have read through both Bills carefully and have found nothing at all in them that could possibly be objectionable either to the Opposition or to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are always pockets of poverty around but, in general terms, we have built up a high standard of living and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> wish to retain that standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that we are dealing with a Government which confesses that in itself it is the creature of people who are not elected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but are responsible only to small groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - for this country - it has been a year of progress and reform on a scale unmatched in the records of this Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have done nothing that we did not promise to do: we have done what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> charged us to do when they conferred upon us their mandate in December last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How striking it is, how revealing, how salutary a lesson for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that the two areas of Government policy most fundamental to the people’s needs and aspirations - education and health - are the very areas where our opponents have resisted our reforms with the greatest determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet for all the legislation I have mentioned the Government had a clear mandate from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite the House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to compare this Government with its predecessor, to compare this Government with the tired, resentful, nagging and squabbling rabble who oppose us in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We regard it as a trust from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am confident that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - when next they are asked to choose between the alternatives before them - will endorse our record and renew our mandate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes the reports that we read of our speeches are not what we would have written if we had been writing them, but I think all of us would say that the job done by the Press is absolutely essential to the democratic process so that what happens here can, through the judgment and interpretative pen of the Press, reach all the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This program for the new session of the twenty-eighth Parliament is seen by my Government as a continuation of the progressive policies of reform which it has pursued vigorously and unflaggingly since assuming office, and for which it has a clear mandate from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740228_reps_28_hor88/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With confidence that you will fulfil to the utmost of your abilities the deep responsibility the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> has placed upon you, I leave you to carry out your high and important duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740228_reps_28_hor88/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what is being put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a matter of deceit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the situation is made more ludicrous because the 2 referendum questions on which the people recently voted and which might have had some appeal to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were overwhelmingly defeated because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were suspicious of the motive of the present Government, which is to bring about unitary or centralised Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To imagine that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would accept the new referendums is just kidding oneself beyond belief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government hopes that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, through ignorance of what they are doing, will become accomplices in the Labor Party’s plans to seriously damage the democratic processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The astonishing thing is that what is being put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> now is a proposal that takes us much further away from Labor’s long held principle of one vote one value than we have been, or would have been under the Government’s proposals in the Commonwealth Electoral Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the kind of distortion of the electoral system which this great champion of democracy, the Prime Minister, wants the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to approve at a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What an insult to the intelligence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party knows that many of the things it wants to put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in referendums will be rejected, as they should be, but it hopes that by lowering the threshold, by making it easier to change the Constitution, it might be able to get some of its changes through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> realise the dangerous course being followed by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The immediate consideration is whether these questions are reasonable ones to place before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We therefore recommend that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> vote firmly ‘no’ on this question of involving the Commonwealth in local government affairs, as we recommend a no’ vote to the other 3 questions that are before the House at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are frightened’ to let the people pass judgment on what is the best voting system which is all the Government is asking of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will now appeal directly to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who have been so frustrated for so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in this document that we must provide permanent guarantees of the rights and privileges of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask all those honourable members opposite who do not trust the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and say that they should not be given a vote on these great democratic proposals to stand and be counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, in part, explains why a total of 7 referenda proposals are to be placed before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in less than 18 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it tries - and this is the only way in which it can do it  -  to steamroll the measure through this House, thereby denying any effective democratic discussion on what are very fundamental constitutional issues to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition completely opposes each one of the measures that are presented here and believes that by presenting them in this form the Government is setting up a very valid reason for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to reject each of these measures when they are put to them by way of referendum later on this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister is dedicated to the destruction of the Senate and everything he says is said in bad faith and with a deliberate intention of deceiving the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740305_REPS_28_HoR88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to know from the Minister - he is not known as the Trappist of the Australian Parliament - precisely what question the Government proposes to put in the referendum to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite him, before he disposes of this Bill, to tell us in precise terms what will be the form of question put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and what explanation he proposes to offer for the extraordinarily long clause which will become a section in the Act that is, making an assumption that it passes through another place; an assumption which is more easily stated than, I believe, carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has received a clear mandate from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to do this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest this action will be the first step in a campaign by the Labor Party to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that there is no need for the Senate at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That brings us back to the real intention of the Bill, that is, the first step towards convincing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Senate serves no useful purpose and ought to be abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposal eventually will be put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill, more than anything else this Government has brought forward, nails the idea of centralism in the obscene way in which it is sometimes described by Opposition spokesmen because it seeks to have the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> say to the Australian Government: You can have power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 3 arguments of the Minister for Secondary Industry were: Firstly, that as a result of consultation with the States, this fifth of the guillotined constitutional amendment Bills has been presented to this Parliament for urgent passage so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can take a vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This particular consultation with the States, of course, was set out in a recitation of events beginning with the arbitrary dictate by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitiam)  at the opening of the Constitutional Convention of a range of matters which he said were going to be presented to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by way of referenda, irrespective of the Convention and the deliberations that were going to take place and irrespective of the concern of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a concept which this side of the House happens to support, but it does not support it just in a rash way - in a way which sees the passage of a Bill through this Parliament as the acceptance of the measure by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It rather sees it as necessary that there be meaningful consultation, that there be the passage of a Bill and reference to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for their support of a question on the interchange of powers which is acceptable to the members of this Parliament and acceptable to the States and, therefore, can be supported at the poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is a measure which should be passed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, but I do not believe it has any chance of being passed by its being hastened through this House in an unseemly fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would see the Government as trying to gain support at the polls for its Labor candidates in the Senate election, not based on any premise of providing order and good government for this country but based on providing a confused understanding of where it is taking, by way of change, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The letter was a request that this particular measure be deferred so that there can be not only a reconciliation of views and a final settling of the terms of the proposal to be presented to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but also a submission to the people in a more dispassionate atmosphere to ensure a reasonable prospect of its passage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>common sense nor the will to express its point of view in such a way that the legislation could have been supported by all members of this chamber and by all the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the proposal is now presented and as it will be submitted to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by way of referendum, it is doubtful whether the States will support it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740306_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as one who is concerned about the status of Parliament I do not see that the numerical record of legislation passed through this House  is  the  only  criterion by which we can judge whether a Parliament is undertaking its correct task  of  exercising adequate supervision over the excesses and abuses of a government by adequately examining legislation an ensuring that the legislation meets the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is concerned to achieve the greatest possible degree of human happiness, peace and contentment for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that one of the important features of debates in this House is that members on this side of the House should try to educate the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to let them know what is going on in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where is the party which offered the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a deliberate plan to reduce interest rates? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fine sentiments and cunningly deceptive policies, once offered to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, have been replaced by a dull catalogue of legislation enumerated in the Queen’s Speech - a speech which admitted that the Government regarded inflation as a most urgent domestic problem and then proceeded to dismiss that problem in a single line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave - In this, the first week of the new session of Parliament, I wish to report to the House and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on my recent visit to South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With confidence that you will fulfil to the utmost of your abilities the deep responsibility the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> has placed upon you, I leave you to carry out your high and important duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Speech almost concludes with a reference to the policies of the Government for which, it is said, it has a clear mandate from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People were amazed at the way in which foreign companies could come into Australia, take over and develop Australian resources, and leave a mere pittance for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The different approach taken to the long term needs of the Australian economy and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by this Labor Government can be judged by a resolution of the United States Senate dated 25 February of this year in which the Senate recognised that there is a direct correlation between the demand for and supply and price of fertiliser and the supply and price of food paid ‘for by the American consumer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the form in which the question last Thursday was addressed in no way contained the inference he imputed, but rather it was an attempt to obtain, to the satisfaction of this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, facts that it was necessary to bring to light. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not the intention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> or Government to sit back and rely on a powerful friend to safeguard and protect us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More importantly there is one imperative that must be hammered home to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - the Labor Party must be kicked out of office, and kicked out just as soon as it is practicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In order to provide such widespread benefits, Governments often have to impose extra taxes and often have to change the order of priorities, but let me assure honourable members opposite who fancy their chances in an election that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are daily becoming more and more aware of just how many benefits are being planned and implemented in their communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a program that I believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, when given the opportunity, will overwhelmingly endorse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an awareness by Government of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and Australian conditions, and a course of positive direction from which all Australians will benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now we have a new thrust in a new direction attuned to the contemporary demands and aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She did her best, but upon listening to it, it was very difficult not to realise that the Government really had no plans for this coming session that would in any way improve the lot of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those are the things of which we are afraid, not just us as a Party but also the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If any support is needed in arguing the case to the Governor-General I will go out, taking with me whichever colleagues the Government wants, in order to persuade the GovernorGeneral that he should allow such a course; that it is the will of the whole of the Parliament and that it is the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that we put the question to the test now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister, in a policy speech in 1972 as the Leader of the Opposition, said that the Labor Party would present ‘the most carefully developed and consistent program ever placed before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>*. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a brilliant piece of insanity, a piece of insanity for which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will pay for decades to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said: ‘We want the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to know the facts.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaving aside the fact that a reduction in the tariffs on imported goods could endanger the jobs of some Australian workmen, I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were entitled to believe that they would be able to purchase imported domestic appliances at a lower price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This would give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a good opportunity to say whether or not they wanted to give a mandate to the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that I have mentioned quite enough to show that the Government ought to be ashamed of itself and it ought to be prepared to face the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the very earliest opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker, you must have been astonished to hear the honourable member for Henty  (Mr Fox),  who has just resumed his seat advocating that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be given an opportunity to express their opinion at referendums on a number of matters which are of great importance for the national sentiment developing in this country, when over the last 12 months the honourable member voted against the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> being consulted by way of referendum no fewer than 7 times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the question of local government representation on the Loan Council and on the question of the control of prices and incomes - on no fewer than 7 separate occasions - the honourable member has voted that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s opinion should not be heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition, instead of facilitating such a referendum as one might have hoped, instead of letting the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a free choice and a free vote on the subject of whether they wanted in effect a 2-tier federalism or a 3-tier federalism, opposed at every stage the Bill we brought in to make the referendum possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, I find, are simply- no longer willing to leave to Canberra, or in the case of my own State to leave to Spring Street, decisions which they know should be taken in their own community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  very strong’ reference to the public opinion polls would lead us, and unfortunately the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, to have no hope for recourse from this present Government because the public opinion polls show very clearly that if this present Government had the courage to go to the people- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would reject very firmly the continuance of the Australian <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a Prime Minister who wants to orchestrate the business coming before the Senate so that he can falsely present to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> an argument that the Senate is obstructionist, that the Opposition in the Senate is obstructionist and is delaying and refusing the passage of legislation which ought to be passed because of the mandate granted by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is ample evidence of the attitude of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> towards those unfortunate victims in Queensland and in the northern areas of New South Wales of the recent floods, and for that matter the flooding that is still occurring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the moment there is no alliance between the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the American people because nothing is done to promote it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any one reading the Press today or listening to the public media over the last couple of weeks could be misled into thinking that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be asked in the next few weeks to agree to cut out elections in Australia or in some way to change the electoral laws to give serious advantage to one party or another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Australia we have a situation where the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have no basic guarantees that governments will hold elections other than for the Federal Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The cost of the defeat of this legislation will be felt by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for years to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have heard the Minister for Housing  (Mr Les Johnson)  speak about his 3  Ms -  manpower, materials and money - when he tries to demonstrate to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that he is grappling with this real problem of housing and when he tries to excuse his own abysmal failures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government proposes to ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to approve of various amendments to the Constitution by way of referendums at the time of the next Senate election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More progress in introducing new ideas into the housing industry has been made in the last 12 months than over the last 30 years, and I am quite sure that in the next 2 years we will see a greater number of houses being made available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at a much lower cost than has been the case up to the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All the things that this Government seeks to do will be implemented despite the Opposition and despite the Senate, because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> demand to have them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No longer are the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> prepared to sit back and take what a government is prepared to dish out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am quite convinced that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have the good sense and the responsibility to support these measures that we will place before them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they wish to put themselves forward to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as representing fair government, I think that in all decency the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly),  who is yawning his head off, should say that he is prepared to table that report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The way to democratic government is not sectional rule from one area of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want something to say about this too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me that at the moment the Australian Government wants to force companies owned by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to come under public ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a distinct honour for  Mrs Marcos  and I to be able to tender this dinner in honour of one of the most distinguished leaders in our part of the world, the innovating leader of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, who has brought into the Government of Australia a fresh new wind of innovation and a creative energy, symbolic and representative of the character and the strength of Australia and its people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These remarks could never be related to a political party such as the Liberal Party or the Country Party in terms of its foreign policy because when the Liberal-Country Party coalition was in government, it deliberately misled and unconscionably deceived the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was because the Liberal-Country Party coalition Government so misled the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it is necessary to keep on saying it so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not fall again into the trap of a foreign policy which is based on lies and deception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He insinuated - and this was a statement that was made by a representative not just of a political party but of the whole <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - that any change in government in Australia would be entirely unacceptable to the United States and he invited the United States to consider for itself whether is really wished to contribute actively to a shift in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are now getting back to where Australians can hold their heads up and be proud of a foreign policy that is not based on lies, that is not based on myths, but is based on the reality and the understanding of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the time of this, his first major visit, to South East Asia - and this is the tenth overseas trip that he has made since he assumed office some 13 months ago - certain parts of Australia were facing a very grave domestic crisis caused by flood inundations in Queensland and which was of tremendous importance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Speech by  Her  Majesty the Queen of Australia on 28 February set out in precis form what I believe to be a continuation of the policies that were initiated by the Government in its first year of office, the new policies to be initiated in this and the next session and also an assurance that the ideals, hopes and aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be effectively answered by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we are thinking of at the present moment is that if this Government is allowed to remain in office and to persist in its present courses, the security of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is vastly endangered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government has fought to put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the proposition that the Constitution, which was formulated 70 years ago, be amended to enable local government bodies to have access to the Australian Loan Council and to much longer loan terms - up to 53 years- and to borrow at the bond rate, a lower rate of interest than they are presently paying, and also to empower the Federal <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the House do not agree; nor, I believe, do the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has failed to fulfil the expectations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because of its administrative incompetence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> need to understand is that as a result of the actions of this Government we will not have the DDL; we will not have that deterrent or anything like it, even if the Minister - as has been fed out in leaks to the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister believes otherwise, let him say so or have heaped upon him the censure of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> which he and the Government undoubtedly deserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Federal Government wants ‘ to save the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and cut down on inflation let it cut out some of its bureaucracy and give the money it is paying into this great Department of Urban and Regional Development to the State governments as added funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The only way we can safeguard our future is by finding large reserves of oil, and the only way we can provide fuel to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at reasonable prices is by doing the same thing - finding oil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should ask themselves whether the prices at which BHP is virtually forced to sell steel are really good for the nation in the long run. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If BHP is not equipped to supply Australia’s steel needs, or if it is forced to export more of its products so that it can gain some compensation through dearer world prices, then the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will suffer either through shortages of steel or through having to import much more highly priced steel to meet their needs <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now is the time when he should be telling the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what they can expect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, we have seen the amiable colourful Minister when on his overseas tours successfully confuse the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, our Asian friends, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and  Mr Hawke,  the  President  of the ACTU, as well as his own Prime Minister and Government on immigration policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As serious as these and other specific policy issues may be, there is an even greater issue facing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is to those 20 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that I make my appeal today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must decide whether they want a socialist society with one centralist government or a free enterprise society where the freedom and enterprise of the individual is of paramount importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The acceptance by the Commonwealth of a far greater share of the financial responsibility for education and the doubling of the amount that was previously allocated for this field certainly has given the educationalists of Australia the means by which they can bring about what they see as the essential educational qualities of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not so long ago they accepted an alteration to the Legislative Council which should give us a fairer democratic system in South Australia and which should reflect the wishes of the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that the matters to which I have referred indicate that the Labor Government will push ahead with a program that should give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a much better life in future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final charge I would like to deal with is that the Government has ‘failed to fulfil the expectations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because of its administrative incompetence’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now we know that the Government’s whole education case is fraudulent anyway, because the Government has tried to have the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believe that all grants should be on the basis of relative need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite are so short of arguments and so short of sound reasons for attacking the Country Party that they must try by deception - while the proceedings are being broadcast - to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that this thinking was instigated by the Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the greatest concern of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in all occupations and at all levels of income is the completely unacceptable rate of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government’s actions last week mean that the Government intends a major change in the composition of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> or in the composition of skilled tradesmen in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the Minister’s claims and despite the statement of 11 October last year which was so full of words but of no substance, the Minister has not been candid with this Parliament or with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as Professor William Macmahon Ball pointed out within the last week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless the Minister makes quite plain the Government’s intention, the future direction of policy and its consequences for Australia and the composition of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and unless the Minister is candid in these particular matters he runs the grave risk of losing continued union support for the migrant intake and he runs the grave risk of arousing expectations in Asia, if this has not already been done by himself and the Prime Minister, that will not be fulfilled and which will lead to a worse relationship between Australia and our near neighbours than we had before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a plea for information to which the Opposition and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>idea, or wishing to suspend the easy visa system or wishing in fact to bring back discrimination, is out of touch with the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and certainly does not represent the bulk of his colleagues because I have representations almost daily on behalf of the constituents of his colleagues, urging tolerance and urging that in fact as much as possible there should be if not an open door a friendly door, a good neighbour policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will have to learn that it must devise policies which will be attractive to the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a policy that has been analysed and clearly understood by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It all boils down to the fact that the Labor Party fooled the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in 1972 with a slick promotion campaign which glosses over the misleading and wildly irresponsible promises contained in the pre-election speech which was delivered by the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next time when the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a chance to show what they feel they will not be fooled again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wanted to speak about the referendums because I regard the questions that are put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as deceitful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am particularly resentful that this should be done in regard to constitutional issues when we cannot put our point of view across to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an important matter because a constitutional matter is before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to have the points of view of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is just not good enough for an ample explanation of the Bills so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can make an intelligent and informed assessment of whether they are in the best interests of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He pointed out that the definitions or the long titles of these Bills are completely false and that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are being deceived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently the Government is hoping that in the ignorance of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, these constitutional changes might be made so that greater power will be in the hands of the central government and so that the Labor Government might entrench itself in office by a gigantic manipulation of the electoral laws, a gerrymander such as we have never seen before in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the formation of an independent Australia Council will inaugurate a new era of vitality and progress in the arts, that creative artists of all kinds will enjoy a new measure of security and status in the community, and that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole will have new and wider opportunities to participate in the arts and enjoy the emotional, spiritual and intellectual rewards which the arts alone can provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My introduction to this matter of public importance on the failure of the Government to implement its 4 main policies on housing for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is not a frivolous undertaking but pinpoints one of the more serious of the Government’s administrative failures since it became the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the nationalisation of the housing industry, housing finance corporations and other institutions which will have a severely detrimental effect on our way of life will find no support whatsoever from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Herbert  (Mr Bonnett)  who proposed for discussion this matter of public importance and those who support it, particularly the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lynch)  who spoke previously, deserve the severest censure for the hypocrisy and their attempt to mislead the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is those who sit opposite who would like the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to believe that the States should have the powers but the Australian Government should have the responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its thin veneer of concern for the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> has been readily exposed by the honourable member for Herbert  (Mr Bonnett)  who is the shadow Minister for Housing, and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lynch). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the honourable member for Farrer  (Mr Fairbairn)  for his very enlightening speech and the information he has given to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on the disastrous consequences of the present policies of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am saying is that the Minister for Minerals and Energy is deliberately misleading the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and is concocting an emotional issue which does not stand up to examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it is again about time that the Minister for Foreign Affairs took both this House and the Senate, let alone the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, into his confidence and told us what he is doing in regard to guidelines for aid programs on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government were to recognise that its own socialist philosophy was outdated decades after it wrote it into its platform it might also recognise that its attitudes to aid programs also is out of date and that it is about time it informed this House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the way in which it is going to approach the provision of assistance to developing countries at their time of greatest need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that there is far too great a tendency for funds that are quite altruistically directed by governments on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> towards the assistance of others to be dissipated through the creation of agencies and bodies, the employment of people and the creation of the trappings of office which seem to be part of such creation, rather than used in helping the people for whom, in fact, the aid is intended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would hope that whenever an aid program is undertaken the long term interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not be forgotten. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Agency and the Board will take up the challenge of reviewing the whole broad spectrum of Australia’s overseas aid to ensure that the countries that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> seek to assist by the allocation, hopefully of increasing amounts of money in real terms, will achieve the maximum results from the money so spent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that there is any room for doubt that the Government sees aid as a contribution by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the welfare of our less fortunate neighbours and that this is the way in which the people of this country want to see it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must be very concerned to learn that for the year ended 31 December last approximately 319,000 short term visitors came to Australia, and the short term departures for overseas amounted to approximately 460,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, above all, tourism is people - <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and people who wish to know about Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has the Government brought forward in relation to the referendum proposals shortly to be put before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government proposals show little appreciation of the importance of Anzac Day to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> throughout the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to refer to a matter that will have very serious implications for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian taxpayer in particular if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are saddled, after the Senate election, with a non-Labor majority in the Senate which takes the same attitude as the present non-Labor majority in the Senate has taken in relation to land acquisition in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seriously ask the House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to give very close consideration to this matter because if there is still a hostile Senate after 30 June and it takes the same attitude to this matter as the present Senate, the Australian taxpayers will find themselves up for $200m or something of that order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wish to convey to you and to the French Government the sympathy of the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at this time of sorrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our claims and arguments are given wide publicity in that democracy whereas in China no publicity can be given to the attitudes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When, now, we extend to the French people our sympathy on the death of their President we might perhaps, on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, offer concurrently some measure of apology for the way in which we have singled them out and the way in which our Government has co-operated with left wing elements in the community that have been singling them out for this treatment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One means by which it is proposed that these developments be introduced to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as soon as possible will be the development of an Australian urban passenger train. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor will still sweep the polls because in a short period the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have seen the benefit of good government compared with 23 years of maladjustment, malfunction and bad government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not sure who the honourable member thinks public servants are, but I would like to remind him that public servants are recruited in Australia and are <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and that they comprise a very large section of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would take that action because it is perfectly clear to the whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that there is something drastically wrong with conditions in Australia today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They positively encourage a growth in wage rates which they know cannot mean a real increase in the standards of living of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so the Prime Minister has today further misled and misinformed the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is reasonable for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to ask: Who is the Ambassador to Ireland? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of the gravest misuse of power and the gravest misrepresentation to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to this national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is but a small recitation of the whole range of policies which we would put before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is to happen, it can happen only by the freely expressed will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are deeply concerned about Government policies, about its attitudes and about the direction in which it is taking this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is instability, there is uncertainty, there is fear in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motives and the machinations associated with this appointment reveal such a decline in political standards that the Labor Government oan no longer have the confidence and the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, it did not even get a majority of the votes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Senate rightly uses its authority to check or prevent legislation which it believes is not in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the Senate is accused of blocking legislation and of frustrating the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what it intends to do in order to force the Government to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> so that they can make up their minds on whether they want to continue with a government that has caused so much disruption, uncertainty and confusion, or to return to the type of government which led this country along a sound and stable course for 2 decades. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only thing that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> gave  Mr Whitlam  was a mandate to form a new government; nothing else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, did the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> give the Labor Party a mandate for such a big swelling in the ranks of the Commonwealth Public Service? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It got into office by a very small majority in this House but not an overall majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> give Labor a mandate to centralise more and more power in Canberra, or to seek to change the Constitution to help Labor even to water down the process of bringing about changes in the Constitution? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will tell the people that we cannot, as a nation, continue our maltreatment of the natural environment; that in damaging the environment we are damaging our capacity to keep a kind of living that we believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> deserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can do this only if we have a responsible attitude to the security of this nation by maintaining our strong alliances with our allies and building up a defence service that will be capable of giving some protection to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> if it is ever called upon to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government put forward 5 proposals that it says the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be allowed to vote on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is not entitled to let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> be denied the right to think about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will reject these Bills not because of the provisions of the legislation but because we believe that the Government has lost the confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a right to cast their judgment today on the capacity of the Government to govern effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker, the reason for the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders in order to permit urgent discussion of these measures should be obvious to every member of this Parliament, realising as they should the importance of this scheme to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> no matter where they might be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A universal health scheme was a 1972 mandate endorsed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should permit those gentlemen in another place to take their minds off ex-Senator Gair, their distinguished colleague to whom they object so strongly today, and let them discuss this matter of urgent national importance before the elections so that the people will know which is the party in this country that stands against good health insurance for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and so that they will know what is Labor Party policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite should not forget that they are withholding supply and not allowing these things to be put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore having formally moved the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders I suggest that it will be carried if those opposite want to put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> one of the most important of election issues and to let those in another place know where they stand on this issue and let them know that they are against it and that they will not hide and run away from their responsibilities when they face the Australian electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a chance for them to show they are statesmen - if they think they are - by supporting this motion and by letting the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> be the ultimate judges of these health schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope they will be debated in another place before the coming elections and we hope that honourable members will see that this is one of the issues which must be discussed not only in this Parliament but also before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> whenever they are allowed to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A health scheme is caring about the health of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and how to prevent people becoming sick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be a real health scheme, one that concerns itself with the health of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the extremists are concerned, they spoke for themselves and they were rejected by the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the bucket over Australia from our neighbours and the world if we return to the racist policies of the past would drown us all as good neighbours for an entire generation, and I think that the bulk of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will reject that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will know where the huge resources of the Liberal and Country Parties are coming from and be able to judge who is supporting Australia, who is maintaining Australia - whether it is the Labor Party or those who are paid by big business and multi-nationals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am answering what the honourable member is trying to get over the air to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-14-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to get over the air to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what the true facts of the situation are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-14-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is regrettable that a person of your very high standing and position in Parliament should have brought himself to the situation about which the Opposition felt so very bitterly incensed, but I am afraid that we have to explain to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> just where we are going in this Parliament because of the shameful and shabby Government that we have at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-14-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, I am very pleased that the Western <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will now have an opportunity to elect 10 members to the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither the Prime Minister not the present Minister for Services and Property can play the Western <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for suckers because you cannot try on the people of Western Australia in acts of - political double dealing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are such that we believe that in presenting them again today it will give not only this Parliament but also the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the opportunity to know precisely where members on all sides of the Parliament stand on these important issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a Bill which we believe is fundamental to the safeguarding of the rights of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances I can see no reason why this motion should not be supported and opportunity given to the Senate to debate it once again, for this House to pass it once again and ultimately for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to pass judgment on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that the Government is doing is postponing the day when this Parliament can consider the Appropriation Bills, upon which so much of the future and so much of the rights of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must hinge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition sees it as being quite critical that early consideration should be given to those pieces of legislation on which we can best express and indeed can only express our very real concern at the manner of this Government’s administration, at the culpable way in which individual Ministers are diverting, the responsibility that they should exercise, and are acting against the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can only be justified by the fear that the Labor Government has of going to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the light of the actions of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  last week in trying to deny the manner of appointment of a former senator as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, and the fear of the Prime Minister of going to the people to justify the actions of the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  in relation to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation exercise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is seeking to deny the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> an opportunity which is their entitlement - an opportunity for their elected Government to give effect to the legislative obligations which it has, following a sweeping victory in a general election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They want to take away the right of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have a say in respect of these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opposition which have a vital bearing on the well-being of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are the Health Bills, the Trade Practices Bill and the Australian Industry Development Corporation Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder how many people realise that this piece of legislation will affect the financial prosperity of a very large number of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are now saying is that here is an opportunity for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have a look at the legislation which was brought forward and which has been rejected by another place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 3 pieces of legislation that are involved in this guillotine motion are matters of tremendous importance to the Australian taxpayer, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian elector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not like that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government realises that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not have a bar of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these projects will be financed by the recycling of the $50m to $60m hitherto paid to undeserving companies without in most cases an effective return and certainly without any interest accruing to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure a reasonable return to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from the development of mineral and energy resources, both through the domestic commodity price and by either the payment of royalties and taxes or production sharing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will certainly see that there is a reasonable return to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from the development of minerals and energy resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no sense that I can see or that these companies can see in not encouraging Australian resources to be produced by Australian-controlled companies for the use of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is surely past belief that anyone could seriously adopt policies that make it apparent that the taxpayers of this country have to’ pay exorbitant prices for supplies of petroleum which come in from overseas when there are unquestionably available in the ground today resources that any responsible Australian government must try to develop for the use of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of tomorrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem as it will affect the people of Sydney, unless something is finally initiated very shortly, is that no company can bring on train both the line with one authority and the carbon dioxide trains with the company concerned unless some logical guidance is given by the Government to remove uncertainty and restrictions, both financial and incentive, to try to make sure that people actively try to promote a very important energy product cheaply, for the use of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would expect the Australian Industry Development Corporation to be a central part of that election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition was not only unconcerned that its own Senate Select Committee had concluded after inquiry that AIDC and the Australian Resources Development Bank were far too insignificant to be considered a major force in the capital market and recommended that the activities of both these bodies be expanded; it was also unconcerned that the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were appalled at the sell out of Australia and wanted something to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does it want to stand against the Government and against the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as was clearly expressed in December 1972, or will it consent to give effect to the will of the people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want something to be done to stop the sell-out of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore in the promotion and co-ordination of investment of a free enterprise kind that the AIDC will find most of its work and its service to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This role will have the overwhelming support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Overseas Trade referred, as did the honourable member for Adelaide  (Mr Hurford)  to the tired argument about a mandate from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a situation which demands correction - those who oppose it do so at their peril because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the highest judge in the community, will judge harshly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government has abolished policies initiated by the previous Government which were designed to help and assist the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is what he thinks of democracy; that is what he thinks of this Parliament; that is the contempt he shows for the elected institutions in Australia which alone stand between the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and a wretched Government which will stand condemned in five or six weeks time unless the Prime Minister turns tail and runs again as he did last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our policies were the most comprehensive, well-argued and well-presented that had ever been put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will continue to implement the promises we made to the people despite the amalgam of opposition in the Senate because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are coming to realise that it is the Senate Opposition that has blocked the implementation of the most important reforms that we were commissioned to implement on 2 December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Progressive legislation that this Government has passed has been in the face of deliberate, blatant, frustrating tactics from the Opposition majority in the Senate, who were elected almost 3 years and 5 years before this Government’s policies were endorsed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This relict, this obstructive Opposition majority in the Senate continues to stall, delay, defer and defeat important pieces of legislation which a clear majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> firmly said, on 2 December 1972, were needed and ought to be brought into operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These senators are participating in a travesty of parliamentary democracy to thwart the wishes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, to turn the country into turmoil, to create an unnecessary double dissolution if they have the courage to go on with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are many features of its proposals which I find very disturbing and which I believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> also will find very disturbing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s proposal is that there should be a fund which is answerable to the Australian Parliament and, through it, to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not fools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister really believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as a result of this announcement, will forget everything that had gone before? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> forget the effect the Government’s actions have had on the morale of the Services, so that officers are resigning in droves and despite the payment of a very expensive re-engagement bonus the Army gained only 11 men last year and the target strength of 34,000 by 1976 announced by the Minister has now become quite unattainable? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could go on with this catalogue almost indefinitely, but it does most graphically make the point that the Government has only itself to blame if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> treat with profound scepticism the sudden conversion of the Government to an interest in defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should not be surprised if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> asked themselves what new threat emerged on Sunday and came to the conclusion that a group of frightened men on that day felt themselves threatened by a loss of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would expect us to take adequate care, but also to do our share in improving the conditions of trade for the lesser developed countries and for improving world trade as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would agree that we have been thoroughly justified in our actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the vehicle by which we intend to demonstrate to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that we believe power exercised by the Labor Party in office in the Federal Parliament has gone to an extreme which calls upon us, for the first time since Federation, to take measures in the upper House of the Parliament to ensure that these Bills are not passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it significant that the Commonwealth Auditor-General has produced a report, which has been tabled by  Mr Speaker  in this House, which draws the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the abuse of normal financial responsibility in the administration of the affairs of that Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does the honourable member for New England  (Mr Sinclair)  think that the petty, minor arguments and points that he raised tonight will be considered by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when they are determining that situation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1972 the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> said: ‘It’s time for a change’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will reject the Sneddens and the Anthonys who refused to give the Labor Government a chance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who sit opposite cannot afford to let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know the sources of their financial sinews and that is why these 2 open enemies of the Labor Party are joined today in an effort to defeat this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight I have made these few brief remarks in a courteous and, I hope, helpful way to indicate to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that those who sit opposite are the same collection of individuals as they have always been - disgruntled, disunited, incapable, wrangling and in every way incapable of governing this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that when Labor came to office there were about 120,000 people unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The education vote has been doubled and in every way, right throughout this country, tremendous prosperity has been brought to <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to follow the line set down on constitutional issues by  Sir Robert  Menzies and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When Labor faces the people in the immediate future after those frightened men opposite have brought themselves to vote against this Supply Bill, I ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to return the Whitlam Government because it has brought to this country things that the people desire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole thing was revealed only last week in this Parliament, about 3 April, when the enormous difference between the interpretation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and that of the Prime Minister became clear to this House and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to delay the House any longer on these events which led to this crisis in the democratic process of this country where the Prime Minister by his action and his colleagues by their actions brought us to a situation in which it was necessary for us to put the question to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>God forbid that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - if the Opposition parties become the government - should have such irresponsible people inflicted on them as their government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not destroyed only for the Labor Party; it is destroyed for the Labor Party and the Liberal Party but, more importantly, it is destroyed for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This action will give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> an opportunity to pass judgment on the Government in the manner in which I have already done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would expect the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to be very interested in the outcome of this matter: It will be a significant matter in the forthcoming election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has done a very fine job for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At any rate, we now have from the Leader of the Opposition - the Leader of the Liberal Party - an answer to a question relating to what public spending the Liberal Party would cut if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were foolish enough to return it to the government of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As is known by the right honourable gentleman, the now Leader of the Opposition and still to be Leader of the Opposition, because I am sure the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will see through him - if they do not do so his Party will after the 3 years that this Parliament would have existed - ‘this matter has been referred for consideration by Professor Pollard and  Mr Melville. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This man, the leader of this country, is going to ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to allow him to continue to lead this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In preparing legislation for the 29th Parliament, my advisers have taken .the view that the first responsibility of the Government is to carry out, fully and promptly, the program for change twice endorsed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the world-wide nature of this problem, the Government is confident that its measures can protect the Australian economy and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from the most harmful economic and social effects of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government will not allow the overwhelming decision of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the referendum of 1967 to be any longer denied or disregarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is remembered for his very exhaustive programs of meeting the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously he liked the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> liked him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Does the Treasurer recall telling the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> just before the election that ‘inflation was on the way down’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> turned him out when they had the opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is up to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to say whether they want that kind of situation back again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should recognise that a party which is supposedly dedicated to the abolition of the Senate - for that is what its policy says - is forcing debate of these piece of legislation from this, the principal elected chamber of the Parliament, into the other chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now obvious to the Parliament, and in due course it will become obvious to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that the Government is determined to continue to pursue the course of making a farce of this House of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that the Government does not want the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to hear a full debate on these issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential that this Parliament at this time be given adequate opportunity to relate what is proposed in the health care system which this Government is trying to force on to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the problems which are only just starting to reach such an acute form in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a forward step towards electoral reform in line with the Australian Labor Party policy and views of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has been unquestionably endorsed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and I commend the Bill to the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>In energy reserves the Prime Minister has clearly stated, both in Japan and Australia, that the Australian Government’s policy is to ensure that these energy reserves are, to the maximum, under Australian ownership and control in the long term interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the holder of an exploration permit is incapable of fully exploring the area held, the surplus should be returned to the Australian government in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, so that the Australian Government can, itself, participate on at least a 50/50 basis with the new farminee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst the Opposition in this Parliament is frustrating the Government’s endeavours to restore the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to their rightful place in their own country, as the owners and keepers of the national estate and the nation’s resources, and as fair and equal sharers in the national wealth, the foreign interests who dominate our energy business are continuing to acquire, through the State governments, control over some of the best and most accessible coal resources of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is almost as though there is some sort of conspiracy to ignore the past, to ignore the rightful place of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the national estate, and to deny the opportunities to our own citizens which these developments present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the Government’s view the creation of this Authority will be of great and permanent advantage to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be serving a national purpose in gaining for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a proper place in their own country and in the resources of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was just too much for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to swallow and they rejected that referendum proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is sufficient to say that the Australian Labor Party will ask the Parliament to approve a voting system that will enable minority government if first past the post voting is introduced; in other words a government that does not express the wish of the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite sure that it was an oversight his not telling the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> this fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, of course, giving him latitude, I am sure that when the big test comes of a possible joint sitting of the 2 Houses of Parliament, that will be the day when he will reveal the real truth to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the members of the Opposition could not see that point and they let the issue go to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, given the propensity that this Government has for allowing full and adequate debate in the Senate it could well be that, if we were to pass this piece of legislation, the situation could develop whereby those -who are senators or part-senators from the Territories would have a greater opportunity to discuss significant pieces of legislation affecting the wellbeing of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> than those who are their elected representatives in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do this as a matter of principle wearing the full garb of a responsible Opposition because we sincerely believe that if these Bills are passed they will represent a disaster to the health of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, present and future.If sections of the pro-Labor Press want to label us as obstructionist and if the Labor apologists in this socalled Press gallery again want to accuse me of being non-progressive or of over-reacting in opposing this scheme, if the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  or his Leader want to repeat their threats about the dire consequences of our continued opposition, let them do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If passed at a joint sitting of both Houses they will become law, and if they withstand challenge, are binding and operable on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have put up an alternative answer in our health scheme which is the antithesis of socialism and is best for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let him judge everybody by his own miserable standards and not try to impact those miserable standards on us or on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With the rise in inflation since then the costs to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the scheme today would be astronomic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has begun to realise that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, most of whom, as I say, have found the existing scheme to be completely satisfactory, have risen up in anger as they have come to understand more clearly the implications of the Government’s intentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was bcause they had become conscious of the fact that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had seen through their barrage of propaganda that they were frightened into throwing the public a bone - a bone in the form of the so-called White Paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the record of this Minister and this Government over the past 12 months, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be extremely unwise to listen to or to heed reassuring noises of any description. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everything else followed, particularly the large degree of uniformity, government control and the dragging down of everybody and everything to the lowest level, which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will find so objectionable if this scheme comes into being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have never had accurately explained to them what the Government is attempting to foist on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has also tried to discredit the present scheme in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by unscrupulous administrative and financial means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have served Australia and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s time we stopped destroying the will of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to invest voluntarily in high risk mining and energy ventures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s time we had a government that put the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> first, instead of indulging in shabby, unworthy, political hate-mongering against this particular industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s time we got away from the attitude of the 1920s and moved into the latter part of the twentieth century - a time when energy resources, particularly oil, will be vital to the future wellbeing and living standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Leader of the Country Party took this issue, along with other issues, to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the last election, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> judged him to be what he was and what is Party is - an apologist for foreign-owned mining companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament exists so that honourable members can look at the details of the Bills which are passed and which affect the lives and liberties of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is accumulating in its hands all sorts of dictatorial powers which maybe it has not used as yet, but which it is holding in reserve to use against the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> under the form of semblance of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we had been allowed to debate and examine the 54 clauses of the Bill on an  earlier occasion I imagine that there would have been some 20 or 30 matters which the Opposition would have brought to the attention of the Parliament and about which the Opposition might have been able to inform the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> before they voted at the last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government, using its numbers, using the deceit which it has practised on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, is trying to put through Bills whose effect is unknown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for moving this motion is the crying need for the Government to make a single clear statement to the House and, through this forum of the Parliament, to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on the Government’s analysis of the  state of the economy and on its policy to correct the critical situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If those intentions were stated the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be able to see the purpose of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clear consequence of what is that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must accept it as true and as stated until it is denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ever understand the state of the economy when the Ministers themselves do not know what is going on in the Government and what is Government policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it will not dawn on the Leader of the Opposition that that is the case he can be shown only when he puts up motions like this and they are defeated by the vote of the majority elected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One means by which it is proposed that these developments are introduced to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as soon as possible will be through the development of an Australian urban passenger train. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that it has the universal support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in proposing this matter of public importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister in IS short minutes lost any credibility that he ever had because he failed to alert the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the fact that he has been completely incapable of fulfilling, in government, the aims and ideals that he had as a member of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the Minister’s optimism is infantile if he thinks the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are willing to accept the Labor Party’s housing policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that in the process of updating legislation there may be omissions and modifications to legislation which we in the Opposition regard as being distinctly against the main stream of the requirements of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, may be against the purposes which this legislation is designed to accomplish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose was to have the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believe that the Australian Labor Party’s proposal about tax deductibility of interest on home mortgages would have an effect which it will not have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If out of the attack there comes some concrete proposition that will indicate how the Government has failed, what the Government did not do that it should have done or what the Government did that it should not have done, and more importantly what the Opposition would do were it the government, a debate of this kind would be immensely valuable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those facts have been sedulously concealed from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, I think it is important to point out that there appears to be strong evidence that national priority should be devoted to forward planning in our port facilities in association with future expectations of trade and to the provision of financial assistance to upgrade those facilities for the benefit of the Waterside Workers Federation and for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he wishes to do so he will be trying to change the entire social characteristics of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want to be their own landlord; they want to buy their own houses, not to have a landlord which is a Commonwealth government, especially when the chief of it lives in Canberra and is supposed to understand the problems of people throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> gave the Australian Government power to overrule the State governments in matters of Aboriginal affairs and to legislate on behalf of the Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Members of the Government Party not only have made charges against the individuals within the Australian Wool Corporation but also have suggested that the actions of the Wool Corporation - this has been repeated by the Minister for the Northern Territory in this House this afternoon - have been directly contrary to the interests of the Australian wool industry and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the formation of an independent Australia Council will inaugurate a new era of vitality and progress in the arts, that creative artists of all kinds will enjoy a new measure of security and status in the community and that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole will have new and wider opportunities to participate in the arts and enjoy the emotional, spiritual and intellectual rewards which the arts alone can provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that if the Government’s approach were made sufficiently clear to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> there would be comparatively few members of the Australian Labor Party in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If this message got through to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> we would be swept back into office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that an overwhelming proportion of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would agree with that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a federation such as ours, which is designed to express the unity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> it is vital that we have a court system for the enforcement of State and Federal laws which is as unified as circumstances permit and not one that is divisive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has approached this legislation conscious of its own concern and the concern of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that Aus tralians ought to participate as fully as possible in the development of their nation’s industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The AIDC as a whole provides the opportunity for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to be involved in the growth of the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are much more aware of the great sell-out of Australian resources and minerals, and much more vocal in opposing such a sell-out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> endorse the concept of the AIDC as an exciting prospect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the great advantages which legislation of this sort brings to the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is the way in which we can marshal the resources that are available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bank has been remarkably successful, but the one great pity I express about its achievements is that it seems to have completely lacked the ability to communicate with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in order to show them just how much it has achieved, how efficient it was and how competent was its management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has worried the life offices because they know they are trustees for the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, their own policy holders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For these reasons, together with the reason I have already mentioned related to savings, I believe that this Bill is contrary to the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> today can see for themselves very quickly just how much better this man and his Government have proved to be, when they bring in proposals such as these to increase charges - charges that we all have to meet and charges that underprivileged people, more so than others, have to meet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We require a plan and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> require a plan that will deal with all aspects of inflation and not fiddle with the problem in the way that these proposals do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We as the national Government sought from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the power to give funds directly to local governments so as to assist local governments in meeting these costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this situation is allowed to continue we will see a serious development in the mentality and attitude of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that I believe could ultimately be irreversible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot for the life of me believe that this reflects the general aspirations and capacity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put those points forward for consideration and I hope that they are taken seriously by the Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been given since the election is a blow by blow account of ministerial infighting over economic policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The propaganda machine of the Australian Labor Party has tried to make the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believe that our problems are all imported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> denied was the right of a Prime Minister to force a dictatorship on local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It stands condemned in the eyes of all thinking <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But to move from the basis of generalised observations and doctrinaire considerations about how health care ought to be delivered, to a massive scheme to change the whole basis on which the great majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> receive their health care, is an extraordinarily alarming procedure for a government to take in this age when the ideologies of yesterday ought to have died. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In consultation with the States, this Government will enter into a scheme to provide better and cheaper hospital care for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our scheme proposes to increase the amount of cover that the present schemes afford the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We wish to assist their vested interests by obtaining and maintaining for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the best welfare service available by way of a scheme whose application is practical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a right to know whether the Government, if it is successful in introducing the first stage of its scheme, will continue its development by introducing a second stage by which people other than those at standard or public ward levels will be prevented from gaining admission to ordinary public hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he has these figures it is his responsibility to reveal them to the Parliament and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we have a man, one who understands this and who has some practical experience in the medical field, saying that he has not got strong feelings about the proposals that one of the Government’s senior Ministers is advancing and has been trying to force upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for the last three or four years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Government’s plan will not hurt them but it will deny top quality medical care to the countless hundreds of thousands of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - men, women and children - who at the present time in certain areas have access to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, I suggest that the Government might make known to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> where it stands in relation to this case and in relation to cases like it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Government should - perhaps it will - associate itself with this protest publicly so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can know where it stands in relation to cases such as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, in so doing, I would express the concern that those who are participating in the Convention have expressed, namely, that the Australian Government itself should not pre-empt actions or decisions which might be taken within the Convention and by the Convention with respect to possible changes that should be submitted at a later stage to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by way of referenda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the honourable member for Wannon, the prospective Minister for Labor if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should ever be so misled as to elect to office the Party he supports, says that the second objective of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is designed to destroy the system of conciliation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is worth pointing out to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that they are not getting an extra $28m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not be bound by the static orthodoxies of the past, particularly let us not have the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> suffer from this Government’s incapacity to throw aside its inhibiting socialist principles and economic shibboleths. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us find new ways of doing things - of managing our economy - which will give full  expression to the great imagination, the great potential and the great energies of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a time when democracy is everywhere under challenge - in North America, western Europe, Japan - I call upon the Australian Opposition to realise at last the recklessness and irresponsibility of the role it has chosen for itself as a government in exile in the Senate for the past 18 months, a role re soundingly rejected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a mere 10 weeks ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assure the Prime Minister and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that as far as the Opposition Parties are concerned we will fight these issues right along the line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I only hope the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> realise this before it is too late. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that the Health Bills are designed to bring about the nationalisation of medicine in Australia - to bring about a more expensive and less efficient system of looking after the health and welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The measures we proposed during the course of the election campaign are today being recognised by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as being correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The workings of this economy are irrelevant to the objectives of this Government and indeed the aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By playing on the acquisitiveness and statusconsciousness of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, these operators were able to be extremely successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Faced with this dilemma the Government must ask itself whether it is going to have its program contracted and downgraded by an economic system which is irrelevant to and incapable of meeting the demands of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that only in this way will the economy become sensitive and responsive to the demands made on it by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> support the program of this Government and they do not believe that an outmoded economic system should be allowed to stand in the way of that program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer honourable members opposite to this progressive document because it may help them to understand what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will seek from them in this important area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> yet know what is proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if necessary we will go to the barricades because I do not think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want to see Canberra making these decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, or the media, have fully comprehended the significance of this Bill or the impact it will have on Australia, its people, its economy and its life style. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They come here because of their interest in politics and in improving the lot of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-85">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In referendum after referendum the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have upheld the principles of the federal system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How often has any government been able to go to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and get powers transferred from the States to the Australian Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that is an indication that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are adhering to the principle of federalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No Act of this Parliament should convey that power and privilege without first seeking the agreement either of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> or of the elected State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to be treated as though they have no sense, no understanding and no will to make their own decisions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will receive total cooperation from the Opposition if he changes his attitude, and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will benefit from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome the opportunity thus provided for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to see the workings of their Parliament at close hand, to consider the Bills now before us and to reflect on the reasons why this extraordinary Joint Sitting of Parliament has come about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has come about because despite two successive election victories by the Australian Labor Party, despite the clear endorsement by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the elections only 1 1 weeks ago of the Party’s policies and of the specific measures now before us, the Senate and the Opposition are still resolved to obstruct the Government’s program and to frustrate the will of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, in May this year, the Government submitted a referendum to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> seeking to have the principle of electoral equality entrenched in the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> saw through the proposal and rejected it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I venture to suggest that if this legislation had been put forward as a referendum proposal it too would have been rejected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not do so because he knew that if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had been able to examine that one single issue they would have rejected it out of hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it ought to be made quite clear that the Labor Party Government is seeking to have this legislation approved with one motive in mind, and that should not need any explanation to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Government has so skilfully and falsely presented the facts to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that many think that there is a difference of 40 per cent between country electorates and city electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now is the time to put it to the choice of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is to happen, it can happen only by the freely expressed will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s exceeded its mandate and I believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a right to reassess their point of view and to affirm or reject the Government that it put into office 18 months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ‘s a case now of whether the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> still feel the same as they did in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were a wake up to it so they threw its proposals out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A political party like the Country Party which rarely receives more than about 10 per cent of the votes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> has a disproportionate influence on the welfare of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has ignored, again as other speakers have said, the endorsement by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on 18 May 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian people</span> truly representative government and to give practical expression to the immortal words of Abraham Lincoln, which still echo down through the ages and linger in the minds of all democrats, namely: ‘Government of the people, by the people, for the people’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any Prime Minister who is prepared to come into this chamber, on an occasion such as this, and, mouth the fundamentals of democracy but who clearly is unable to provide leadership for the Australian democracy at the present time is not capable of maintaining the confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is of great importance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very glad that television has been brought to this Parliament on this occasion because it brings the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> right into this Parliament and allows them to see the merits and demerits of the Government case and the Opposition case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He either does not see or will not admit that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> choose to elect the senators whom they prefer and not those whom the Prime Minister wants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been subjected to extensive debate in the House of Representatives and in the Senate on 2 separate occasions in each place, and it has been before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is absolutely no doubt that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want a system which gives equality of value of votes for all voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ours is the only Party which truly reflects the thinking of the vast majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, if the Minister is successful in having this legislation approved by the Joint Sitting he will immediately look at the 1972 election results; he will look at the electorate of Bowman and at all of those other electorates which Labor is just holding by a whisker, and he will suddenly start bolstering those electorates which need attention so that when the onslaught comes from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the next election those people who represent these electorates will have a greater chance of continuing in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We oppose this Bill because it is another of those measures by which the Government, without expressing its ultimate intentions, is seeking to pull the wool over the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A little while ago in the House of Representatives we heard the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp)  say in respect of one of the measures that the Joint Sitting will discuss tonight or tomorrow- I refer to the National Health legislation which proposes a health scheme on which this Government campaigned and was elected; it was proposed first to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in 1968 and was restated in 1969, 1972 and 1974-that he and the Opposition would go to the barricades rather than yield one iota, one inch, to the will of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will have the voice but not the power, and not quite the term of ordinary senators; indeed not quite the term in a form which was rebutted by the Australian electorate in one of the referenda proposals which were submitted to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on 18 May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Constitution was drawn up, when it was agreed to by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, it was agreed to only after very sustained argument and discussion, and it was no lightly arrived at decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on the Government side believe that if we have to have a Senate we should try to make it a House which is a little more representative of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason, while feeling nothing but disenchantment with the Senate, as I think a growing number of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are feeling, I support the Government’s proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps those views are shared by other people, but not by the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that perhaps at this late hour, as the honourable member for the Northern Territory, he would have thrown some light on some of the curious performances that we have seen coming from his colleagues with regard the entitlements of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have had revealed to them a series of spokesmen from the Opposition parties whose main goal during the whole of this Joint Sitting has been to deprive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the right democratically to elect the Parliament of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that it is intolerable that any Australian, wherever he may live, whatever his ethnic origin or whatever his educational standard may be, should be deprived of the right to vote in the election of the Parliament of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition hates the very thought of equal representation of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the same way that it hates the thought of any representation of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that democratic government is the only form of government which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How wise subsequent events have proved the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were in rejecting this rash of referenda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of principle, because we believe that this health scheme proposed by the Labor Party would be a disaster to the health of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Opposition cares about is the health of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This debate concerns not only those people who are now living, but also those to be born, because once this Labor health scheme is impacted on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> there is no getting away from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that it was quite fair and proper for me to refer to the Government’s miserable record over the past 18 months to allow the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to assess what hope this health scheme has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition will not abandon its duty to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have not sunk home to the people who matter, the people who pay the medical bills- the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- because they have been caught up in this political propaganda war that has been waged by our political opponents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But,  Mr Acting Chairman,  the Opposition has deliberately set out to hoodwink the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Liberals have not told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, for instance, that the present hospital bed benefit of 80c a day for uninsured hospital patients is the same as the amount which was introduced by the Chifley Labor Government in 1948- never changed by conservative governments over nearly a quarter of a century- and they have not told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Labor Government wants to increase that subsidy to hospitals for uninsured patients from 80c a day to $16 a day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The dangers of the proposed health scheme on the medical profession, on the private hospital system and on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> make me feel very concerned about the fact that the Government should persist in introducing a scheme which is not wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his 1972 policy speech the Prime Minister said that the Australian Labor Party was determined that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be restored to their rightful place in their own country, as the owners and keepers of the national estate, and the nation’s resources, and as fair and reasonable sharers in the national wealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Anthony) has just said, that the Minister has become a living legend in the history of the Australian mining industry because he represents the turning point in the history of this nation against the sell-out of Australian resources, with which I will deal in a few minutes, to the statement of a full and effective responsibility of the Australian Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in relation to that mining industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is concerned that the industry should contribute more to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> than it does and it is convinced that something like the Petroleum and Minerals Authority for which this Bill provides is necessary for that purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important to adopt that approach because of the attempt by the Government, particularly by the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor),  who is sitting at the table, to conclude 3 things: Firstly, that the Government has some sort of a mandate for this proposed legislation, secondly, that the proposed Authority would be in real interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; and thirdly, that any opposition to the BUI is unfair or perhaps improper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just as the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> almost wholly financed our oil refining capacity in the 1950s via the manipulation of import prices for oil, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have almost wholly financed much of the mineral development of Australia in the 1960s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that 250 pieces of legislation, in round figures, were introduced into the Parliament last year and that the great bulk of them were passed into law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These 6 Bills found their way to this Joint Sitting and they are opposed even in this last hour by the Liberal and Country Parties, not out of wanton obstructionism but because this side of the chamber, representative of opinion held over a wide spectrum of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, believes that they are bad in principle and are likely to detract from the effectiveness of our parliamentary democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second basic proposition- if anything the more basic point- is the legitimate national sentiment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that Aus.tralians should be in the vanguard of the development of this country and that there should be a maximum of Australian ownership and control of our industries and resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the House  (Mr Daly),  who is sitting at the table, probably intends to threaten us once again by saying that if we have the temerity to move for the suspension of Standing Orders in order to debate these great national issues, these things that threaten the living standard of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, he will by the march of his numbers take action against us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A Budget will be presented in a few weeks time, but surely today would have been a wonderful time, by way of preamble to the Budget, to have a debate about how the people are feeling and for the Opposition at least to express what I believe is the majority view of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, who have just about completely lost confidence in this Government and its handling of economic and industrial matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> agree that a simplified voting method is essential in the interests of democratic elections, and that is precisely what the Labor Party is endeavouring to do, both by means of redistribution and the simplification of the voting method. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make that significant statement because it was the desire of all political Parties in Australia and indeed of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> after the last war to develop Australia at an undreamed-of pace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have witnessed a great era of growth that has generated the wealth that has improved the general living standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But what that report did not say was that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, during this period of growth, had their living standards lifted to equal the best in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the implementation of the recommendations against that background of consideration will be to the long-term benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think that when the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> elected the Labor Party to government they realised how fierce those costs were going to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst congratulating him and endorsing the remarks of the honourable member for Wimmera  (Mr King)  I severely castigate the other  speaker,  the honourable member for EdenMonaro  (Mr Whan)  who, when the industry and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were looking for flour to bake, gave them only candy floss, which, Like his promises, merely melts away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been hoodwinked long enough by the term ‘grant’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- I think this point was made by one of my colleagues- the Prime Minister was holding out to them the promise that a Labor Government would actually make grants available to the States free of interest to assist them to overcome the backlog. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is rather pertinent at this stage to have recorded in Hansard to support the arguments by the honourable members for Petrie, Parramatta and Boothby that 57.92 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> live in urban centres with populations of more than 500,000; 6.58 per cent live in centres with populations of from 75 ,000 to 500,000; 2.52 per cent live in centres with populations of from 50,000 to 75,000; 4.9 per cent live in centres with populations of from 20,000 to 50,000; and 4.21 per cent live in centres with populations of from 10,000 to 20,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It clearly indicates to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the different direction that would be taken by a Liberal Party-Country Party government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>and  Mr Hancock  or  Mr Laws  saying: ‘It is quite reasonable’, only to find some Australian Labor Party trained trades hall stooge saying certain things and making suggestions which cloud the issue in an attempt to distract the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from the real destruction which is going on within our community today? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he does not know whether profits were made on overseas money markets, does he not believe that he has a responsibility to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, to the Government and to this Parliament to ascertain whether they were or were not made and, if they were, how much money was made and by whom? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740925_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In saying, ‘We are giving to you, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, these magnificent benefits’, the Government is completely forgetting the fact that the taxpayer is the one who is called upon to pay for the sum total of their cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740925_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that they need to be recognised by all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as still being an independent lot because the Government is certainly not helping them, to the degree to which or in the way in which it would assert. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740925_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To me this is one of the central pieces of Australian history and it is a chamber that is, for that reason, of tremendous significance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my opinion this is the best way to provide a national economy in which a healthy, growing rural industry can play its part, not only to meet the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but also to meet the needs of the millions of people in undeveloped, underprivileged and underfed countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This financial year the funds- the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s funds- are coming entirely through one Treasury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was honoured by  Her  Majesty and I am sure that this House would join with me in recording a tribute to the very long and distinguished service given to this Parliament, to the people of Bennelong and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by  Sir John  Cramer- a person who always espoused the Liberal philosophy and always showed a very real concern for persons who came to him for assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members opposite may complain about it, but the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> elected it in 1972 and reendorsed that decision in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He won because the people of his electorate recognised that he was a strong man, a man who had a lot to give and a man who would represent his electorate and build for himself a career in the national Parliament where he could contribute to the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable members should remember that it is all right for such changes to be made in the Caucus Room and flung into this House, but if the Senate- the Senate the other House elected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- makes one suggestion or one amendment it is obstructionist and unreasonable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They announced proudly: ‘We are going to increase interest rates’, and this is the problem which has been put upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> through local governments, on State governments, and of course on those people who are borrowing for their houses, borrowing on overdraft, borrowing on hire purchase or personal loans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No Budget is beyond criticism but the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> deserve some better appraisals than the Opposition’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I finish on this note: There can be no doubt that today the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are becoming increasingly disillusioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that if a statement were prepared by the Government’s advisers concerning defence problems and the uncertain future that our nation faces it would be a frightening statement in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Budget has demonstrated clearly, there has been a failure to plan for the future in terms of dealing with unemployment and inflation; yet such a plan is what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> require immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have been criticised for our attitude to multinationals but I hope that some day the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will approve an assets tax being introduced in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not deserve this type of treatment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What ought to be remembered by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is that the social contract- it was a social contract- of that day has been broken by this Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The program is contained in the policy speech of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  for which the Australian Labor Party received a mandate from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at 2 elections- in December 1972 and as late as May of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So I wonder at the effort which the honourable member for Lilley has made in trying to hoodwink the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into believing that honourable members opposite are a real alternative government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I mention inflation and I am delighted to see that the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor),  who was to be the Acting Prime Minister, is in the chamber because it is of tremendous importance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to realise the farcical manner in which this Government pursues its administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite who attempt to lead people to believe that there is a simple, painless remedy for inflation are deceiving our nation, are building up false expectations and, by their refusal to face the reality of the situation, are sabotaging the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the years subsequent to that statement the societies have developed and have been trusted by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because they are strong and because requirements have been put on them with respect to their own asset structures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If not, will he re-present a factual 1974-75 Budget to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> so that they will know just where we are going in the current financial year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#debate-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The state of the economy and the poor performance of the Ministry were the main planks of our platform for the election on 18 May but the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were not then allowed to know the facts and they did not wake up to what was happening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I make no apologies for my unshakable belief in the right of individuals to determine their destiny in their own way, subject only to the rule of law, and I would defend an economic system based on individual and corporate enterprise which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know and understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again in this Budget the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been asked to believe that, provided the Government spends record amounts, in the short term the quality of life must improve, that opportunities for education must be greater and that better social welfare will result, while all the time the potential recipients of this mythical Government generosity are being asked to pay a greater and greater share of their income in taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government, through its ad hoc decision making, has failed to give any guidance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and has thus contributed directly to the deep disillusionment and discontent to be found everywhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last May the Labor Party gave an undertaking to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it would have no part of stop-go economic policies, that it would not tolerate unemployment, that only Whitlam could reduce inflation to 8 per cent by the end of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At that stage he recognised that inflation was an issue and he told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>: ‘We can cure inflation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was before, as a result of some aberration on the part of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, he became the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of declaring to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that they propose to destroy the system they have gone about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the Parliament, and I hope to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that this Budget is a design, marked by high purpose, to destroy this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What steps has the Minister taken to express the abhorrence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to any breakdown of the Geneva Conventions by any of the parties to the Cyprus conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister knows perfectly well that the information that he sought to give to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on this matter on his return was not factual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as things stand at the moment I am inviting the Government to recognise that there have been 2 savage breaches with respect to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first breach is represented in the fact that this proposal will bring a needless injustice to scores of thousands of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; secondly that it will bring injustice to people in that the proposal represents an increase in taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that they ought to look at the Opposition’s POliCy very hard because, whilst it may be a superficially attractive policy, it is a POliCY of funny money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While excellence is a worthwhile objective, it is important that our overall objective is to encourage the creative spirit in all the art forms among all the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view, and I believe in the view of the great majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, there is no better way of doing that than by having a system with a constitutional monarch as the head of state, as we presently have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the referendum on Aborigines in 1967 when the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> gave the Australian Government the right to legislate for Aboriginal advancement there has certainly been a big increase in the Government’s activities in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-This discussion of a matter of public importance has been initiated by the Opposition to highlight the urgent need for a comprehensive series of economic initiatives to restore stability to the Australian economy, to indicate constructively the package of measures which the Opposition believes should be introduced as a matter of urgency, and to provide the Government with an opportunity to give a clear lead to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to spell out in detail its policy intentions in ensuring the restoration of the stability of the Australian economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wittingly or unwittingly they are undermining the confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the Australian investor, in the long term security of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the unfortunate thing should happen that we become the Opposition again, I hope that that misfortune is tempered for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by the honourable member for Wentworth becoming the Attorney-General rather than  Senator Greenwood  who was a completely unfortunate choice for anybody who believes in civil liberties in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Individual members of that police force are given the advantages of a uniform system that is bigger and has better promotional opportunities, more flexibility and greater diversity of work, which will continue to improve the morale and efficiency of the service that that police force can provide to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the House that the most solemn pledge that can be made in this chamber to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is the pledge to maintain full employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 30 May 194S such a pledge was made to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that for the Minister for Labor and Immigration  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  who has a smile creasing his face, to contemplate the situation in Australia today for which he is responsible without any apparent concern is for him to commit the gravest fault against the memory of his own Party, but more significantly against his obligations to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the proud proclamation of the Australian Labor Party, made very shortly after the now 30-year-old promise to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and shortly after a full employment plank was enshrined in policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today we are in 1974, and the Opposition has policies that will be acceptable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just want to tell the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  that in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> vituperation and vilification are not the hallmarks of a fighter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Treasurer: Is he able to take any action to protect the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from the usurious conduct of such finance houses? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there any machinery available, such as the Prices Justification Tribunal, that will protect <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when they are required to borrow money? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he assure this House that the facts about the Broadcasting and Television Act are put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has  Mr Hawke  issued a statement that the Government would not be returned to office because it has lost the confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and has he followed this up by issuing a public ultimatum to the Government to take action on the economy before next week? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that what I have to say in this grievance debate is echoed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall endeavour to be constructive and let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister and his socialist Government did not reveal to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what the true facts were when the election was held in May of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the last month or two we have seen the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> react to this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the cost to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> has not been properly assessed or debated nor has its method of funding yet been decided or announced; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the sort of perilous situation this Government is putting before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation will potentially alter a significant part of the way of life of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> if it is passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is more important to me is that a large percentage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not now entitled to any compensation in relation to accidents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-33-70">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill seeks to give, and undoubtedly will give, to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> peace of mind and that basic and fundamental right to which they are entitled, namely, freedom from want that afflicts so many people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-33-74">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the argument of the Opposition is based on the cost of the scheme, the figures that I have set out show that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> this year will be paying in premiums twice as much as our proposed scheme could possibly cost for all those now injured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In government we shall ensure that housing for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> recovers the priority it enjoyed before Labor started to pull it to pieces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was very interested to hear the honourable member for Kingston  (Dr Gun)  mention how enthusiastic the socialist Government now is about <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> owning their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This harks a long way from the admissions made by the Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Les Johnson)  when he was first appointed to the portfolio and set himself out to make sure that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in fact did not get the chance to own their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that is something he should look at if, as the honourable member for Kingston has said, his Party is interested in <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> owning their own homes- something I doubt very much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The industry would have a chance of getting the shot in the arm it badly needs and in overall effect it would be for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be appraised of the fact that they have a hard working Parliament in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to control the hearts and the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by control of their housing needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are terribly important, I would impress on members of this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, not only to the industry with which they are associated but also to all aspects of life in our metropolitan areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should promote the exploitation of mineral, pastoral and other resources in northern Australia for the maximum overall and long term benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be exploited to the advantage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Prime Minister at the United Nations said: ‘We in Australia accept our responsibility to reassure countries which depend upon our resources that they shall have steady, secure access to those resources at fair prices’ the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believed that there had been a switch from the so called ‘keep it in the ground’ policy of the Minister for Minerals and Energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister is proceeding with his dream of establishing a national gas pipeline grid, although he has never advised this chamber or the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the details of any costbenefit analysis or feasibility studies on projects which will cost the taxpayers at least $ 100m during the next 18 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that the sort of administration that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are being expected to pay $5m for? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is his responsibility to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to make sure that coordination of policy does become a reality and that personal likes and dislikes take second place to the national interest which, above all, is the responsibility of Ministers of State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government and its few remaining supporters are trying to fool the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by saying that unemployment and inflation are world wide problems, particularly in the Western world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Never before in this place have I heard speeches from people so concerned about something which diminishes the educational prospects of so many of our <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as previous speakers on this side of the chamber have brought to the notice of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, this is merely a manipulation of figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member is correct in his deductions which are shared by the overwhelming majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though they have watered it down to a degree, that policy did show the people of Australia the real thinking of the Government to which they had changed and which the Labor Party had told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> it was time that they had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that what was going on then did not reflect the opinion of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position has been that we and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have never been able to be quite sure what the Labor Government was going to do next in any field and principally in the field of foreign policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No longer is it to be regarded as a body remote from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and designed to serve only the information requirements of people in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such demands to try to increase the availability of grain and other essential food Will fall heavily upon the shoulders of the United States, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, indeed upon the European Economic Community countries and upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is genuine in its claim to have a humane approach to the problems of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> it should give them a psychological lift by encouraging the exchange of Christmas cards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely we are entitled to ask and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to know from whence this threat is to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there were a threat I for one would be prepared to say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as would the Government: ‘We have to set the priorities in a different way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, God bless them, effective protection and assured security; and, secondly, at the same time expose the manner in which this present Government, hell bent on a snivelling subservience to every little tin-pot communist country, has emasculated the Army, ripped out its heart and wounded- as yet not mortally, but near enough to it- the proud morale of our defence forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on numerous occasions since have rejected constitutional changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No increase in wages can make up for the conditions in which a vast number of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I assure the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren)  that any moves by his Department to uplift the standard of living of a vast number of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will have my support and also the support of the Australian Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Through Film Australia, the Australian Government’s film production arm, to make, or commission the making of films, meeting the requirements of a Department of State or authority of Australia, films dealing with matters of national interest to Australia, and films designed to illustrate or interpret aspects of Australia or of the life and activities of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government can now see that these wrong policies imposed tremendous burdens of unemployment and misery on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government intend to make decisions itself about what goods the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do or do not need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-50-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Who takes decisions within the Government about what goods the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do or do not need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-50-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Government has taken certain completely new initiatives which benefit the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and which also require some necessary modification of the Public Service staff ceiling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The failure of the Government to permit debate of its foreign policies in this Parliament and the need to have such debate on international issues of concern to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing is being put to this Parliament; nothing is being put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason it is the responsibility of all governments, regardless of their political colour, to ensure that they bring to the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, through the Australian Parliament, the activities, the problems and the solutions which the government of the day sees as being best fitted to the interests of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not quarrel with the principle of the rights of a Prime Minister and leaders of a Government to travel overseas to ensure that they are up to date with trends and expectations of other nations, but what I do comment on is that on their return it is the right of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> through their Parliament to know what the Prime Minister and the Ministers have learnt by their experiences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is a democracy and if this Parliament is to be active as it is supposed to be in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> we need to discuss these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the worst features of this Government’s behaviour- and to this extent I say that the Minister is also slightly guilty- has been its treatment of the States and the way in which it has managed to circumvent the Australian Constitution and thereby impose its socialist and centralist ideology upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is of considerable interest to us and, I am sure, to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As recent State and other elections have certainly indicated, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a different idea of the mandate given to the Government from the idea which the Government has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The failure of recent referenda makes the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s view quite clear in relation to attempts to upset the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, I welcome the finance being made available which, indeed, is the first essential step to be taken to provide more housing for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we appreciate the fact that the Minister has sincerely endeavoured to do his best in this direction because of the general policies of this Government his efforts and the general progress towards home ownership for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> has been undercut. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are behind us and they proved by their overwhelming defeat of the referenda proposals that they believe in State rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am saying that they were muddlers and that the consequences of their muddle are now being felt by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from Perth to Cairns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have even greater admiration for the honourable member for Mackellar if he would use the time of this Parliament to bring to the notice of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> gigantic rackets of the type that I want to re-emphasise and which were referred to in three of the major newspapers today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the heady days of late 1972 the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were promised a new deal, a new horizon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decision after decision was taken rushing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the economy into confusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker, with this Bill the Government will make a three-pronged drive to improve the quality of life of our <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To do this we must provide an urban environment which includes all of the facilities and life style demanded by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and provides them at a reasonable cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These remarks would indicate to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that this Australian Government is the only Government that has ever done anything for local government Let me assure honourable members that non-repayable grants are made by State governments and that in Queensland in particular subsidies range from 15 per cent for roadworks and drainage up to non-repayable grants of 40 per cent of cost for sewerage works and up to 50 per cent for new water supply schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister whether it might not be in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, who are already paying nearly $ 1 ,000m a year for imported fuel, to adopt the policy of the Opposition Parties, which is that oil pricing policy should be reviewed now with a view to deciding what should be done after the expiry of the present agreement, having in mind the urgent need to stimulate exploration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if this is the kind of record that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want and of which the people in the Labor Party are proud, they can keep it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are growing used to and becoming familiar with the Government’s new programs relating to schools, pre-schools, kindergartens, health centres, hospitals, sewerage, drainage, sports areas, sports amenities and art centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government knows it to be untrue and I am confident that the good sense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will prevent their buying it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But today, stop-go in the strictest sense is a grim reality for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I sometimes wonder whether, in that inner Cabinet, there may not be a voice which says it wants to end unemployment but really is out to create chaos for the Australian economy and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government has assaulted the welfare and the prosperity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-34-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is evidence, and we should be following it up and seeing that the evidence is made available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the people of other countries in the free world so that they can assess for themselves the validity of Soviet protestations as to whether they are adhering to the treaties of the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the very first time in 25 years we have a government that has a positive policy on wages, a policy which, if adopted by the Arbitration Commission, will bring about the stability in the economy that the whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are craving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone from the Government side of the House, concerned as we are for the maintenance of employment and the living standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, will recognise that it is primarily through private industry, where three-quarters of the Australian work force are employed, that employment and living standards are maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of this Bill will enable the valuable contribution made in past years by the defence service homes scheme to the housing of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to be maintained and improved upon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the categories of the type I have mentioned- the purposes of a department of State, matters of national interest and matters designed to illustrate or to interpret aspects of Australia or of the life and activities of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are to continue to live in a democratic society it is fundamental that all areas of the media, in particular television and films as well as the Press, should be allowed to remain free from ministerial guidance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are faced with the problem of how much power they, as the elected representatives of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, should give to such bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a democratic power, and the rights of the Minister who is responsible through this Parliament to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be safeguarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>films that are designed to illustrate or interpret aspects of Australia or of the life and activities of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a quota system has been established the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to have not only the details in terms of numbers but also the policy justification and the exact composition of the migrant quota mix. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be significant problems that will remain for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to resolve in their own hearts and minds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government that occupies the Treasury benches is in power because of a fraud put over the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister also points out rightly that this 80 per cent recovery target was set by the previous Government, although it had never moved seriously to reach that target because it recognised that general aviation was not in a position to maintain the sort of services required by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and at the same time meet such increased charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think if we can achieve a situation- perhaps by the amendments proposed to this Bill- of ensuring that things like that cannot happen we will certainly go a long way towards protecting the assets of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and, naturally, of the country itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amount of money which is involved is probably not significant enough to have a serious effect on budgeting but it is Australia’s resources and the assets of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as opposed to the community and to the society, that are at stake when we are dealing with these unscrupulous company promoters and people of that nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not going to say that we will agree with it, but at least the Australian community, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian taxpayers will know where they stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government had not had the numbers, we could have guaranteed and assured the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that all of these things would not have happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by saying that it is all very well for some of those honourable members who interjected during my speech tonight to be critical about this matter because so much of the water resources in the southern or south-eastern part of the Commonwealth has been harnessed to the very great advantage of that area, but we want to see the other States deriving the benefit that can be derived within that framework in their own areas which, of course, would be to the benefit of all the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take this opportunity again to assure honourable members and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Government has every confidence in the positive, firm and clear manner in which  Sir Laurence  Mclntyre has consistently and frequently stated the Australian Government’s position on these very difficult matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter of public importance has been brought forward today to point out to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the dangerous situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a stupid system it is that those opposite try to justify and under which they want the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does that not prove to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what a phoney collection the Opposition is and how phoney are the arguments that have been brought down? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor)  informed this House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Government had invested $3. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are getting fed up with the idea that the Labor Party should be constantly looking for scapegoats that it can blame for the faults in the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is what the Prime Minister put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the 1974 policy speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has tried to deceive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by refusing to acknowledge our insulation from international cost rises, especially in oil, and in all the other commodities in which Australia has a tremendous price and supply advantage over other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In no case has the Leader of the Opposition or the Leader of the Australian Country Party, who followed him in the debate, in criticising destructively what the Government has done in the last 2 years said what he would have done in the circumstances if he had been elected to government in December 1972, had the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> made a serious mistake and returned him once more to government- an inconceivable situation, of course, at the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The continuation in office of the present Government will ensure that inflation is controlled and regulated, that unemployment is prevented and that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are fairly and equitably treated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was presented to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> only on 17 September- not very long ago- and it has already had 2 major revisions and a number of smaller ones. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Premier of Western Australia could very well join, in that minority of Liberal-Country Party Premiers, with the Premier of Queensland in seeking to divide the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- in seeking almost to want to create farmers republics or the re-erection of the State boundary fences- when it is in the real interests of the people of this nation that we ought to be developing as a nation, not as individual sections of a nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I pointed out in the Estimates debate, there are the costs now being imposed on the community of so-called education- $450,000 to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that another department, superimposed upon all the State instrumentalities, is in fact spending their money in a proper way, and what a great and wonderful job it is doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That argument is quite specious and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know it to be false. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So will die the incentive of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then represents the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However I will say this: The consistent assault upon the Department of Aboriginal Affairs as a waste of money is doing a great disservice to the Government’s approach and the approach of the whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the advancement of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a great disappointment, especially to the Opposition, that during this time the Government has failed to come forward with guidelines to advise the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of exactly how it proposes its aid programs will be carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no point in accepting students, for example, under the Colombo Plan unless we are sure that on their return they will be employed in the fields for which they were given training paid for by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I leave the judgment of their responsibility, or the lack of it, to the good sense and to the patriotism of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that the legislation introduced was not only impartial but also of far reaching benefit to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But on the overall picture, let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> realise that sitting opposite today are people who believe in rigged boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is possible for  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  to win on Saturday- and that seems very doubtful- he can put it down not to the vote of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but to the rigged boundaries under the Country Party, which continually criticises this Government’s reforms and will not give effect to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that this Government, for all its political debates and harangues on the hustings during 2 Federal elections has failed to deliver to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and companies the real goods on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to say on this issue, as they have on so many others, that this is a government of double standards which is prepared to preach one thing during election campaigns but which, on so many other occasions, has not been prepared to produce the real action to back the words which it has put down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More so than the Prime Minister’s speech, it was a series of platitudes designed to indicate to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that perhaps the Government was concerned about the control of Australian resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s basic aim is to ensure that Australia’s mineral resources are developed in such a way as to bring maximum benefits to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will assist the Government in ensuring that maximum benefits accrue to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We still do not have legislation which this Parliament can say honestly to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is up to date, covers the loopholes and is going to do the job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, we only see the odd Press release advising members of the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of action taken by the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  following advice from that Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Government has not told us, what it has not told this Parliament and what it has not told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is that, in the last weeks, it introduced into the Fourth Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations the following resolution which I was lucky to come across when reading reports, and reading them somewhat more avidly than, with the exception of the Minister for Science, who is at the table- no, let us just tie it to the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Senator Willesee)-  that Minister seems to read his own reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By and large we object to the way in which bad news which the Minister puts out as being good news is unfortunately reported and the true situation is not coming through to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So to that extent we think it is unfortunate that the things that we are saying are not being picked up by the commentators and reported accurately to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been drawing the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the current shortfall of dwellings which we believe at this moment is in excess of 50,000 and which we believe by this time next year will be as much as 120,000 or even 130,000- almost one years’ supply of houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately none of these things is being reported and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not know what is happening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that until the national health plan of this Government is in operation it is as well- it is a watchdog for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian contributors- that health benefit organisations have some sort of eye put on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would just sum up by saying: I believe that this Bill, brought in in the dying hours of the voluntary health scheme, as the Government sees it, is symptomatic of the deceit which has been exercised by the Labor Party in relation to the health scheme ever since 2 people called Deeble and Scotton came along and said to it: ‘We have got a nice tidy little compulsory socialistic scheme which you can sell to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and which will help you get back into office’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what I object to is this carping, cheap criticism of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in travelling overseas, acting on behalf of the Australian community and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: If inflation is the most serious and urgent problem facing the nation and if he believes that a united national effort is needed if we are to meet and overcome this problem does he accept that if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are to be united and determined in the fight against inflation they must be told the truth, however hard that might be, about the causes of inflation and about what must be done to deal with it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>February it can turn its attention to what should be the first concern of the Australian Parliament, that is, the security and continued existence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, of course, proper for the Government and everybody else to point out that the primary responsibility for dealing with inflation lies on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From these points of view even Canberra seems not to be entirely ideal and hardly to form a model for growth centres which will be based on a wider cross section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the points I want to emphasise to the Minister, because what I fear and what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must fear - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we are entitled to know and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to know what Miss Morosi’s qualifications are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am concerned on behalf of the great majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who I believe have an interest in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation proposes nothing more than an additional tax on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, most of such companies will be more profitable and the loss will accrue to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> through growing unemployment and the closing of avenues for the application of higher skills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am confident that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, when next they are asked to choose between the alternatives before them, they endorse our record and renew our mandate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have worked unremittingly to fulfil our undertakings to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these measures have been endorsed- most of them endorsed twice- by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But he is the one who has lost the confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>position side believe that the Senate has acted in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately at present this Government is robbing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the opportunities for the development it should have in achieving its future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  has, on a number of occasions, said words to this effect: ‘I give you, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, an unqualified commitment that the Labor Party is committed to full employment.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are genuinely worried because they know that if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> lose respect for the parliamentary system of government there is nothing standing between these traditions and the institutions as we know them, and street law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today, as the Government about-turns, as it makes plausible remarks and as it pours out rhetoric to the effect that it has seen its mistakes and is going to mend its ways, it is up to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to make a judgment on whether they really believe the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate is a fully constituted House elected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> elected the full Senate- not half of the Senate but the full Senate- in May last year they made a decision that a brake had to be put on the excesses of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Opposition faces the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on that issue it will suffer a worse fate than having Supply cut off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a big job to be done for the people of Darwin- not just for the people of Darwin but because all the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> expect us to do the job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What he wants to do, of course, is to completely take over the voluntary health insurance funds and to use their reserves, their assets, and their personnel to ease the transition of his compulsory health scheme which we know is opposed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- I wish to report to the House and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on my recent mission abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stress that point because, for some weeks, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> witnessed a persistent and often unscrupulous campaign by sections of the media to deter me from my visit, and when I was not deterred, to disparage what I did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has said to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>: ‘Throw off your shackles and be free’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only trouble is that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have no shackles to throw off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the Prime Minister to pretend that he has a great national issue- an issue of nationalismand that we have to be independent falls emptily on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for we are free, we are independent, and it does not make us the more so because we keep saying it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister’s role was to indicate clearly that he represented the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when he said to these countries: ‘Why have you reneged on your beef contracts?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is wrong with you <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was always the proposition that the Australian Labor Government would follow policies that were inimical to the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They always associated the policies of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with the policies of the United States Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It made me feel very proud, as an Australian, to see the reaction of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to those who suffered in Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sometimes am disappointed with the attitude of some <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, but the response in this particular instance throughout Australia was magnificent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might indicate that they were prepared by the Western <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and not by us- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To their chagrin, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> endorsed their decision of December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within weeks they were plotting once again to negate the popular decision of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that election the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> voted overwhelmingly for Labor candidates in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the growth of financial institutions catering largely for the middle income earners, there has never been a Government policy directed at the housing needs of that energetic and deserving section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- those above the level of direct need, but who yet require a marshalling of the resources of the community if they are to attain the high quality home which should be the heritage of every family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am confident that the vision and hope which have gone into the creation of this Aus.tralian Housing Corporation will result in a much more constructive approach to housing in Australia for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the legislation is frustrated, either here or in another place, let those who frustrate it explain to the Australian electorate the reason for their activities; because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will wish to know the answer to the question: What have you got to hide?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let me say this to them: The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not sneer, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not ridicule because, whether you like it or not, they are worried about present events and they are concerned about the role of foreign-owned corporations in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want to know the source of political funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not looking at whether we can educate the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on proper policies; we are falling for the advertising gimmick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be the responsibility of this Parliament to devise media laws and electoral laws that will involve the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in becoming conversant with the point of view of every political party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is very important that the Electoral Act of Australia and the media laws of Australia are structured so that the political parties are putting over a view which is doing something to lift the consciousness of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This BUI is not one which is designed to restrict the ordinary activities of decent <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, whatever their political persuasions might be, when they support the political party of their choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great deal of money has been expended on behalf of the Department of the Media in order to explain things to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- of course, in a completely impartial and non-political manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that this legislation represents a forward step in line with thinking in democratic countries which seek to keep politics free of the implications and imputations which go with money power poured into party funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Hayden  took the view that the previous work test was quite unacceptable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take the view that it is imposing somewhat upon the patience of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have yet another referendum thrust upon them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my astonishment the Prime Minister persisted and put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> 4 referendums in areas into which the various constitutional subcommittees were already locking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beyond that, one goes to the description of the proposal put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> last time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Bill became an Act and were submitted to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the proposal were affirmed there would be a new form of control over casual vacancies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument advanced by the Government for the acceptance of this Bill for its passage, the argument which the Government advanced during the course of the referendum campaign as to why the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should approve of the proposal, was an argument in both instances based entirely upon convenience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He failed to accept the decision of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and he continued to spout forth rather spurious arguments which have no basis in fact and which do not pertain to the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He refuses to accept the judgment and the decision of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister is totally incapable of accepting the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the wish of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we will oppose this legislation, reinforce the arbitrary decision of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and force the Prime Minister to walk the tight rope of people’s rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what the Prime Minister is endeavouring to do by saying that the proposed method of simultaneous elections- as I said, defeated at a referendum by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- will be cheaper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should not and, we submit, it cannot be changed merely at the whim of a person who, for his own political advantage and cheap notoriety in the short and long term, seeks to continually put propositions before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> which will have the end result of making all power reside in one House of the national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We submit that it is both unnecessary and unwanted and we ask the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  to accept the democratic vote of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, who told him in no uncertain manner that they do not want a bar of this type of legislation and they will not stand his meddling in the affairs of substance in a way which interferes with their basic rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Senate has a responsibility to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to stand up and fight for its basic preservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague from Moreton  (Mr Killen)  has outlined already, better than I could, the political unreality of a Government, which only 9 months ago received a rebuff in this proposal, attempting to crash through with this proposal- to use a description which has often been used of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)-  by presenting it to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government wishes to bring about this change of the law- the consent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be required- because the change is consistent with common sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By what basic law of natural justice or common sense should the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> be required to elect half the Senate from time to time but at times different from the times when they elect the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that there is an area for philosophical discussion whether or not the centralist administration of power or federalist administration of power is in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The prediction by the then Governor-General,  Sir Paul  Hasluck, that the Constitutional Convention might result in a monumental flop regrettably and tragically has come to pass as the product of this Labor Government being prepared to assert its interpretation of what should be the changes in the Constitution without reference to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and without their consent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was this not the tenor of their opposition back in April and May when we tried to put a number of propositions through this Parliament on which we wanted to seek the guidance and the opinion of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In return there was an implicit understanding, written as far as possible into the Constitution of Australia, that in no circumstances would that delicate balance of power between the Federal government and the State governments be disturbed except by the consent not only of the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but also by the consent of the majority of the States which formed that Federation and entered into that compact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Court is less representative of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> than are their elected parliamentary representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where does that leave the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know, the Opposition has consistently opposed what it believes to be an act of sheer vandalism, and has opposed it on both practical and philosophical grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that it is supported in this action by a majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and it sees no reason to change its attitude on this Bill which is designed to administer the final coup de grace to the voluntary health scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is introducing a health scheme which does not have the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, will have to pay for Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An independent actuary recently estimated that the cost of Medibank to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> through general tax revenue would result in an increase of approximately 7 per cent in personal tax rates in a full year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tragedy of the Government’s approach is that in order to extend coverage to all Australians it is taking away the rights and freedoms of choice of many <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and professional groups involved in health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government encourages people to drop out of private health insurance before the entire Medibank scheme is in operation, it will deserve the gravest censure of this House because it will be utterly and completely defrauding the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who will have no recourse to the array of choices of hospital cover, which they presently have, if they drop their nongovernment insurance contribution and are relying on the government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am interested only in securing the best scheme in the most economic way for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Opposition are most reluctant to discuss this Bill and to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> why they are opposed to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not want the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to know that it wants certain people to be disadvantaged and that it will sacrifice contributors to those funds on the altar of private enterprise health insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No wonder members of the Opposition did not want to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> why they oppose this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Medibank proposal was put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the Federal elections in 1969, 1972 and 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that basis, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> elected a Labor Government in the last two of those 3 elections and the Bill dealing with Medibank was enacted following its passage at the Joint Sitting of the 2 Houses of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party Government stands for a health scheme which will provide for the interests of all the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is inconsistent with the interests of lobby groups like the AMA or the voluntary health funds, we believe that the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must have priority of place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that this Government is deceiving and misleading the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with the same sort of deceit that has been perpetrated on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from time to time by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that the full facts of the way in which this Government is ignoring the proper workings of the Senate committees and the evidence and advice which they are prepared to give to the Government might be known to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> I think it proper for me to read from the speech which the  chairman  of that Senate Select Committee,  Senator McAuliffe,  delivered to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the issue about which I, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and many’ members of this Parliament, feel strongly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here is a very clear illustration of what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> think about the AIDC trying to borrow $20m and, if practicable, $40m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s understanding, its appreciation, its thinking about the AIDC is settled in that respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot understand why in the case of a man like the Treasurer, who likes facts to be known, he and his colleagues have ensured that the report of the Committee is not to be made available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of equal importance, the Government wants to get into the business of superannuation and savings in order to raid the savings of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to put them into this objectionable fund which has not yet proved its ability to be both viable and profitable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They could work as they want and use the savings of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in a way that could be disadvantageous for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people, especially those wedded to the concept of private enterprise, believe that the national interest can best be achieved by ensuring that the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, whether they be workers, manufacturers, employers, capitalists or anything else one wants to call them, are given every opportunity to develop in the best interests of individuals and therefore of the community of which they must form a part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that case was accepted by the great majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and I thought that it was a compelling case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think I made a comment that it was high time we gave up the double bed for the double barrel and that we had outdoor movies that were of a much more wholesome character than some of the rubbish that was being dished out to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- a feeble attempt to try to mimic the blue films that are being produced in many countries today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has created circumstances so that there are significantly disadvantaged groups of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, many of them in the area which this Bill purports to cover and for whom there has been no positive help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to be asociated with this debate as a protest against the treatment that is being handed out to a significant contributor to Australia’s overseas reserves, to an industry which has made a meaningful contribution to improving the quality of life of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally over many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australia Council should be what it purports to be-a body which, by its membership and the membership of its boards, reflects the aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Australia Council is to be established with the specific intention of upgrading Australian art and giving the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a better deal and a wider choice of opportunities it is essential that it be above all else down to earth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Council seek to identify that need in its purchasing policy or does it, in exercising its purchasing power, take a risk and attempt to buy a world famous art form such as ‘Blue Poles’ or House Under Construction’ with neither of which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> may ever identify? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These discussions put forward the Australian viewpoint that self-determination was a principal issue, a principal concern, for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and for the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that, as far as the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are concerned, there are several things that we expect of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, we on this side of the Parliament believe that the Prime Minister has a responsibility to remove the justifiable doubts that there are in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as to what his attitude is and what the attitude of the Australian Government is on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regard it as being a great tragedy that in this debate the Prime Minister himself has not been prepared to assert the Government’s attitude but that instead we have had an apology from the Minister for Science saying: ‘Really, don’t you worry, <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As of last October the exchange had not taken the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into its confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again the exchange has not seen fit to take the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the victims, into its confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever the Opposition makes points about legislation and warns of certain dangers the Government charges the Opposition with supporting matters- in this instance the stock exchange- which are not ethical and are against the interests of the bulk of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should know that if and when in the foreseeable future, or the far distant future, honourable members opposite become the government, the new Treasurer will be a man who has taken funds from mining interests but will not reveal them and will be legislating in their interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> require an end to this situation one way or the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Bill does not explain just who comprise this section of the community, but under clause 6 of the Bill it would appear reasonable to regard that large section of the community as very nearly one-quarter of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the House: What can be more divisive, more damaging to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, than a centralist socialist bureaucracy dictating its own terms by the device of regulationdividing the community into various groups who may receive a housing loan at subsidised interest rates and other groups who may not? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Never at any time did they reach a situation in which they were able to house <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at an economic purchase or rental price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We heard the honourable member for Bendigo  (Mr Bouchier)  talking today again, as honourable members opposite always do, about the fear and threat to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of nationalisation of the housing industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The States have made great progress in satisfying the housing needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While the Australian Government has these powers, previous governments have made no attempt to harness and direct those powers to the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I emphasise a point which has been made by others: We are an Opposition of compassion; indeed, the Liberal Party has as a specific objective the uplifting of all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This document has been produced at the expense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is supposed to be a Bill in which the Government co-operates with State governments to meet the housing needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Liberal-Country Party Opposition in this Parliament will go down as the people who exercised the methods of obstruction frustration, delay and deferment in its cynical campaign for power and in its cynical method of approach while it tries to settle itself down and to overcome its bitter internal fighting in order to present itself to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at a future election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those governments ignored that advice in their cynical disregard for the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Irrespective of what he thinks the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not so dense that they cannot see through the nonsense he is advocating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To buttress marriage by keeping divorce fault orientated does no more than turn the clock back to the 19th century, a situation which is simply not acceptable to the great mass of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is most important that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> understand that there have been some very significant changes as compared with the Bill as originally introduced into the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the vast majorityvirtually all- of ,the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would accept that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But equally, I judge, a period of 12 months is too short to give respect to the institution of marriage and the family as the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would require. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great number of people want to support this legislation and a great many who want to support it have some amendments; a significant number would like to be able to give some voice to general principles which they believe are important so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can see the general principles guiding this House in its examination of the Bill at the Committee stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is behind his threat that once again the Senate may set aside the verdict of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> twice recorded in favour of my Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must be able to look to their national leader for ethics of the highest standard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple answer is that they cannot be trusted, and the sooner they are removed from positions in which they are so demonstrably abusing and dishonouring the forms of this House the better it will be for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker, I believe that the Prime Minister deserves the confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the face of the tremendous difficulties involved in working on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, we do not need more institutions involved in housing finance but rather greater efficiency on the part of the existing ones to meet the very real demand of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>probably an indictment on all the governments that have prevailed that no Australian Government has yet recognised the apparent need to support the rental requirements of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, but this has been done effectively in other parts of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the fact that they have committed themselves as an Opposition shows that they are opposed to decent housing legislation for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now tonight we are told, under the false pretence of wishing to assist the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with housing, that the Opposition wants to move amendments to the Bill in the Committee stages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real truth of the matter is that the Opposition does not want the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have decent housing legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to decent housing and good legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is necessary only because of the tactics adopted by the Opposition which are preventing the Minister for Housing and Construction from putting through legislation to give a decent housing scheme to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This indicates that he has not done his homework and shows his contempt for the housing needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the House want to use this national parliament as a forum to expose to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> these erroneous thoughts and arguments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to grab every piece of power and to put it in one piece of legislation without indicating the purposes for which such powers will be used is beyond common sense and, I believe, is beyond the current mood of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I say to him is this: It is the  growing mood, it is the growing conclusion of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the financial instability which has been visited upon Australia has been brought about by the incredibly extravagant programs which have been entered upon by the Government of which he is a member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Buying back the coal is just one of the methods by which we can buy back the farm and restore ownership to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has made too big a mess of this matter to think that it could ever justify itself in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We heard the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  today repeat the sickening statement that Medibank has been approved by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on 3 occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One term that he has been using is ‘the rapacious health funds’ or the greedy health funds’, trying to conjure up the view that the health funds are same multinational company out here to rip profits off the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to plough them back overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main concern we have with the national health scheme of the Labor Party is that it will be a deterioration in the quality of health care provided to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even at this late hour on behalf of the Opposition I plead with the Labor Party and I plead with the Minister to stop this insanity because the Government will have not only an open-ended inflationary health scheme impacted upon us but something more serioussomething that probably would cause the most serious damage possible to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government agreed to the deletions when the Bill was returned to this House because other sections of the Bill were of great importance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister must have grave doubts when he has to spend that sort of money in promoting a scheme which he says will be so readily acceptable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition hopes that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be guillible enough to accept what it says. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think they have any conception of what the national Parliament is about and what is national responsibility in terms of a thing like the health of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Social Security cannot assure this House or the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the same will not happen to the national health scheme which is being proposed here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the Labor Party received about 50 per cent of the votes at the last election, the Minister thinks he has a mandate to carry out something that he can impose upon the whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I doubt if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the business sector in particular will believe it because the animal does not so easily change its spots. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, how can the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian business community believe in the intentions of the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I look forward- I am sure the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> look forward- to a lifting of those standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say that the Prime Minister has lost the respect of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and the people who were present in the Parliament and saw his reckless, ruthless demonstration of intemperate dictatorial authority can bear witness to the fact that he does not deserve to be Prime Minister of this great country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now allowing takeovers by multinational corporations, a practice which it claimed and has claimed consistently over the years to be detrimental to the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I warn the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Government is completely bereft of credibility and sincerity and is reversing its policies and its principles only in a vain and desperate attempt to regain some of the popularity that it has lost with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that if the Government succeeds in hoodwinking the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- God forbid that it does- it will have a change of heart immediately it gains some security of tenure of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is necessary to test the provisions of the Bill against this fundamental proposition which, I believe, is one which would have the support of the vast majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Railways are a major capital asset representing an investment of about $2,225m by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They shared, and encouraged the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to accept, a delusion about the nature of the conflict in IndoChina. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this immediate emergency, no government has been more active, more concerned and, reflecting the wishes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, more generous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And it is worth noting the real reason why the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> expect their Government so to act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have accepted the truth- the bitter truth- that the intervention into which they were led was disastrously wrong, that it only increased and lengthened the agony of Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have acknowledged the truth in the same way as the American people and the American Congress have acknowledged it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is worth noting, as the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  said, that the real reason why the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> expect the Government to act, as it has done, is not just that it may reduce the scale of suffering but that we have a special responsibility to Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In circumstances of conflict, a head in the sand rigid attitude of ideology, the advancement of ideology insensitive to the sufferings of men, women and children and the exploitation by the Government of the concern of” the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for human causes provide no excuse for a foreign policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, for some extraordinary reason one group in this community- the present Government; I refuse to associate it with the culture, character and conscience of the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- seems to be prepared to take the view that what is to happen must be allowed to happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will be told that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will have a real opportunity to make a finite contribution to the wellbeing of Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to honourable members opposite: Think of the tragedy you have caused to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both the American and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> now recognise that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could well be established that even though there are many individual cases of discrimination, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a basically good-spirited attitude to people from other nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But for the great majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> this legislation does break a new field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I therefore appeal to those who are not executives of the health funds but who are interested in providing reasonable health care delivery to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> not to be associated with the spreading of scare stories especially where pensioners are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because this legislation breaks new ground, because it introduces penalties and defences which will be strange to the great majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and many people of goodwill will feel uneasy about them, we think that a gentler, softer approach at the beginning is necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principle before us tonight is the claim by the Australian Government that it has the right, the duty, to deal directly with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, no matter whether they are Aboriginal people or nonAboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I imagine that he will refer me back to the referendum which was passed clearly and with great support by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of our visit there, every honour was given to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very disturbed at the moral attitude of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in relation to the acceptance of unemployment benefits when they are not really in need of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government stands condemned for its encouragement of laziness in the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have easy hand-outs- it is a case of easy-come, easy-go, which has resulted in no incentive being offered the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is work shunned by so many <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a cheap and nasty way to attempt to get the votes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by showing concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his wild and sweeping assertions he cast doubt on every one of them, almost suggesting that large numbers of them are guilty of fraud against the Commonwealth and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact I congratulate the Opposition on electing him as Leader because I think that he represents a view which is completely unacceptable to 80 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me just say this: It is fair that the Parliament should discuss the machinations within the Liberal Party and the sad fact that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can no longer go to the polls and make a judgment upon the quality of a leader of the Opposition and have any confidence that that leader will be leading those parties for any length of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at the tactics of the Opposition over the last few years and the disastrous influence in Australia of organisations outside the Parliament that have no responsibility to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s wishes, the Opposition’s promises to have the honourable member for Bruce as its Leader were cast aside and in the interests of shallow political manoeuvring the Opposition propped up the greatest hard liner in the Liberal Party because it believes that a hard, uncompromising line is a substitute for leadership and intelligence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Opposition will find out very soon that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not be conned by the subterfuges and deceptions which it seeks to put over them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not cop it and nor they should. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course they are able inasmuch as they take their orders from outside interests to which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have no recourse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Come what may, I know that, when the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> come to pass judgment, they certainly will not vote for anyone of those opposite who are in or out of the shadow Ministry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is trying to eliminate confusion and if it argues that the reason why this Bill has been brought in is to eliminate confusion, I think it is misleading not only this Parliament but also the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told that there are young, progressive Liberals in Parliament today, but they are telling the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that they are not entitled to have the name of the political party put alongside the name of their candidate on the ballot paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it does not oppose it, but it opposes this provision for the simple reason that it does not want the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to know who the Liberals are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must accept that there can be no restriction on the rights of people to group together, to form parties and, having formed parties, to offer candidates for election by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A basic freedom amongst Australians must be the ability for alternatives to be offered to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 4 proposals were all defeated by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So when we hear him talk later with sweet reasonableness, perhaps telling a few jokes and putting reasons for the amendments which are stated to be reasons of very high principle, we in this place at any rate, and I believe an increasing number of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, will know what value to place on what he says. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that both sides have been elected under the existing electoral law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is the philosophy behind this clause and this Bill, as I said you are fiddling with the rights of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and that is absolutely unjust. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First past the post voting was apparently dropped from the Australian Labor Party policy when it was realised that it was unacceptable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intelligence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is such that they are able to number ballot papers in many cases from one to three or from one to four. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Curtin says that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> reject first past the post voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest the honourable members opposite that they should not consider this matter on the basis of straight-out political opposition to what the Labor Party proposes but should seek to do for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what was done with respect to voting in the Australian Capital Territory and Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new honours system belongs to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the Government is trying to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it is good to have deficit financing, that it is good to have expanded social services, compensation schemes and all these things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for some years have been aware of the need for a higher standard of education for their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At long last the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will have a national body taking a national view of this tragic problem which is still killing over 3500 Australians and injuring 95 000 each year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now see that course coming to an end with the successfull acceptance by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the Medibank scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, however, the Opposition makes clear its policy to the Public Service and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- that on return to government we will have the oath and affirmation clauses reinserted in the Public Service Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether we as an <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, if we believe that regulations ought to be drafted that deal with the quality of goods and the safety matters pertaining to goods that are manufactured for Australian markets, ought to allow the export of goods that do not conform with those standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Council should try to provide some stimulation and satisfaction to the minds and spirits of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major problem, therefore, is that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be given the opportunity, through our institutions and especially through the National Gallery, to appreciate more than just the tradition of art which we have in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the facts still remain that Australians, as a nation, are not going to come to Canberra- only a small section does so- and therefore the national collection, which will be the heritage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and paid for by them through their taxes, must be taken, to some degree at least, to the State galleries as well as throughout outback Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I honestly suggest that our first responsibility is to give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> every opportunity to participate in and appreciate this high standard of excellence which undoubtedly we are going to achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want the Gallery to be finished as soon as possible to put this vast holding of art treasures before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the first possible moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole history of referenda in relation to amending the Constitution is that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are very reluctant to make any change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750416_reps_29_hor94/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be neither quick nor will it be easy and it will require courage from government and courage from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in accepting it, for they know that if they accept it, it will build their future but if they do not accept it it will lead only to the downturn of the very political and economic institutions of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should make it clear to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it is activated and motivated by their interests and from responsibility in government so that when the next election comes, which I will do all in my power to see we win, we will not be haggling over the carcass of an economy which has been stripped of its muscle and flesh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we will be doing is arguing a debate on the electoral hustings about which party will better be able to serve the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and make our economy as great as it ought to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the scene which faces the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the next 12 months? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not be faced with a Government which is prepared to offer restraint and to put the policies which should result in the economy being put back on to a more stable footing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no indication that it is prepared to change its heart and to introduce a Budget later this year or to introduce Supply and Appropriation Bills at this time which give indications to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that there is an air of responsibility about the economic management of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are looking to the Government for the answer because it is the Government that has the power to act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I charge the Minister with deliberately wasting $2m of taxpayers’ money through the flickering screen of television to try to inculcate in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> an acceptance of a system of health care which is nationalisation and socialisation of health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition was able to allow the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a type of medical scheme free of the 1.35 per cent tax on income which the Minister sought to introduce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All honourable members opposite preach the same gospel of despair and advance the same argument of criticism, the same negative, backward looking pessimism by which they hope to attract the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why the present Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  is destined to remain in that position for as long as his colleagues will have him; he is not going to be transferred by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from that side of the table to this side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Foreign Affairs should be on his doorstep at 9 a.m. putting the Australian Government view, which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> support, that we should be providing in Phnom Penh at the moment international forces which will supervise what will be called the peace, the international presence which will see that wholesale slaughter is not allowed to continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is right that a much clearer explanation should be given to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> before we agree to go on with the proposals mentioned by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750421_reps_29_hor94/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would gather from the second reading speech, which was entrusted, probably by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  to the Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones),  that the Bill deals primarily with transport, but this is far from the truth, as honourable members from this side of the House have conveyed to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750421_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition Parties will obstruct and destroy this legislation in another place because they are opposed to any legislation which comes before this House and before the other place which is any good for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750421_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think it would be very wrong of the Government to appoint a person who has not the engineering qualifications that are necessary to manage an enormous project like this which ranks so highly in the general image of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750421_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly, whilst the legal term ‘Common informer’ may still be appropriate, I do not think it is appropriate to use it as a derogatory term in respect of a person who insists that his parliamentary representative or parliamentary representatives of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> adhere to the law which governs this Par.liament <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope, despite the opposition that has been indicated by the Opposition, that the provisions of this Bill which state the rights of Parliament in the control of monopolies that are handed over to private groups will be exercised in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: As this is a major departure from existing practice, whereby authority has rested with the Treasury, will the Government make a statement clarifying its position and its intent so that the House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> might know what the Government’s intentions are? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is the case, why is it not good enough for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to know these facts? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister will not be able to deceive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Minister for Defence said that he had been going up and down the country telling the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the virtues of our defence forces, the honourable member for Riverina replied: ‘That would not take you long’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The beneficiaries will be the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Australian people</span> most certainly will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He took this course because he was not prepared to speak plainly to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of his policies and of his bias towards communist North Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the Prime Minister was prepared to support North Vietnam and betray South Vietnamese refugees is, however, incidental to the central charge against him- the charge of deception of this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the Prime Minister thereby hoping that he would find it easier to explain to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> his own underhand support for communist North Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It deliberately set about concealing this from the Australian Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he had done this, he could at least have been praised for some plain speaking and honesty in revealing a radical change of policy to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ‘Sydney Morning Herald’ was more blunt; under the heading ‘A Government we Cannot Trust’ it said in plain language that the Prime Minister had lied to the Parliament and deceived the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore this is a matter of utmost concern for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the cables had not become public- goodness knows what other messages have been conveyed- the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would never have known that their Government had, in the most secretive way, been double dealing to assist and encourage the communist cause in South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the issue of the Prime Minister’s efforts to withhold from Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the support that he had been offering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is this deception, this act which the ‘Sydney Morning Herald’ called lying, which has moved the Opposition today to censure the Prime Minister on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> whom he deceived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, his standing in the eyes of members of this Parliament and in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> has been badly damaged, if not destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>These people belong to the very Parties that lied and lied and lied to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about Australia’s involvement in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to the statements that were made for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about why Australians were in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Infamous documents were distributed to con the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the Parliament will support the proposition that the Prime Minister acted with great courage and in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in seeking to reach, even at that late stage, a settlement by negotiation of this long drawn out conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Perth made it apparent that the Government, in his own judgment, had failed to make it clear to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the whole standard of living had to be seen in the context of the national income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In almost every election campaign that I can recall, the proud boast of the Australian Labor Party has always been that it would be able to outbid all members of other political parties in their attempts to influence the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to induce them to believe that the Commonwealth of Australia will be able to provide for aU of them from the cradle to the grave simply if they vote for the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter what government sits on the Treasury bench, the fact of the matter is that when the economic truths are clear to the Aus.tralian people and when the degree of mismanagement, the degree of profligacy of the Australian Government over the last 2 years becomes known to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, there will be a great political retribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in saying this we all have to recognise that the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, including the Western <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, are extremely great. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The progress of a people- naturally, I refer to the progress of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- is very intimately connected with the progress of Australian families and the progress of the children in those families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the honourable member for Fraser now to say that the Australian Government is acting unwisely when it looks at the security of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless we can do this the very survival of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that whatever be the responsibilities of an Australian Government, its first responsibility is the security of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government sponsored the lie and persuaded the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the North Vietnamese were the victims, not the aggressors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why the campaign by the insurance companies is misleading and why it is necessary for policy holders all over Australia to take this into account is that competition is necessary in the insurance industry in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and in the interests of those people who work for the insurance companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These grants, I remind the House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, were made without public announcement and represent a further element of the conspiracy of silence which has surrounded the Government’s approach to the present unemployment scandal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In what must be the most gutless exhibition ever by an Australian Government, the Labor Government has run away from its responsibilities to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was he who persuaded Cabinet against the declared opposition of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Manufacturing Industry  (Senator James McClelland),  to back off and abandon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the last opportunity the Government has to make it clear to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to all those who have the care and responsibility of children that where children are being cared for in their homes, whether they are sick, whether the adults in that home are sick or whether the children are physically or mentally below par, those children are not to be disadvantaged because they are being cared for by their parents in their homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Did the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who voted this Government into office in 1 972 in the belief that it was no longer socialist give it a mandate to take away this grant? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The homes savings grant scheme is consistent with the Liberal-National Country Party philosophies of encouraging independence and self-reliance among <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On this issue alone I as a Liberal ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to decide what they most desire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One grieves to be present and to be an onlooker and to observe the shattering of the dreams of many <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am disappointed to have to speak on a motion such as this but I am very happy to join with my colleagues, the honourable member for Boothby  (Mr McLeay)  and the honourable member for Deakin  (Mr Jarman),  who gave a disciplined approach to solving the housing needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are alarmed at the rate of increase in building  costs,  estimated to be upwards of $100 per week or 3 per cent per month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> surely will not stand for that type of political activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has lost credibility and it will never recover from the wave of suspicion that it has created in the hearts and minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It indicates a groping ahead policy within the broad guidelines of denying our young <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the opportunity to be home owners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have tried to point out to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Government does not care about the low wage earner because it is allowing this man very limited tax deductibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a wonderful combination- increasing inflation, increasing Government paper output and fewer houses being built for more <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who want housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what is quite clear is that if we were living in an ideal world it would be nice to be able to say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>: ‘You can have both schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is like so many of the other diabolical measures and policies being perpetrated to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by the Whitlam socialist Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were not aware of the ways and the evils of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless the Government is meting out injustice to so many thousands of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by abolishing this useful Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should know these facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people who have been resettled and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be grateful for the skill and humanity which the UNHCR has brought to bear on such cases in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the AMP, through its touts, is to have its way we are to see that the superannuation for Commonwealth public servants is to be frozen; we are to see that other people in the community who are not Commonwealth public servants are not to “have the opportunity for national superannuation; that members of the public are not to have the opportunity for national compensation at a time when the rates they have to pay for third party insurance are rising so abominably and onerously; that other forms of legislation which this Government has undertaken to provide for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are to be stalled or repealed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It appears that the insurance industry, through its leaders, is now undertaking a program against the whole of the welfare programs which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> enjoy or which they expect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Furthermore, the plan will provide the cars that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make it quite clear to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what actually did take place so as to prove beyond all doubt how incorrect these ministerial statements have been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, last night on the adjournment debate time did not permit me to conclude my remarks in connection with a very serious problem that affects all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, a problem that grew up under the present Opposition when it was in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that I can make this statement on behalf of the Party that I represent: We will not let anybody stand between us and dealing directly with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter how obstructive some of the State governments and the members of the Liberal and National Country Parties in this House become, we will be able to get through to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> just the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the Australian Government supports this by guarantee, but in fact it will be done without calling upon the resources of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> through budgetary arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be remembered by honourable members that during the debate on the second reading I gave good reasons why I believed that it would not be proper or appropriate, and was certainly contrary to the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and of Australian industry, that we should not establish an Australian Government insurance office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> support those views in every single respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the life assurance companies fear that government intervention into the field of insurance jeopardises their POliCy holders and the dividends by way of bonuses, they have every right to let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know the sinister method being applied to nationalise the insurance industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should not try to fool the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as to its intentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is based on offering the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> more and more in the way of welfare and making them more and more dependent upon government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last gallup polls show that only 17 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> thought that the establishment of such body as the AIGC was desirable and that only 6 per cent knew that the Government had any intention of entering into the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  do not think that I have any compassion for the actions of the Government and for what its members have done to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The policies that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> hold in the private insurance area are their savings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>They have indicated that they will use their brutal weight of numbers in another chamber to hold this great measure back from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a measure which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> obviously want and demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude my very worthwhile contribution to this debate by saying that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know that the views of the 300 entrenched insurance companies, of the Opposition and especially of the National Country Party of Australia which has been most vocal in saying that this measure is not wanted by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, are wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The measure is one of those that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have thought about and have had put before them, and not only at the election in May of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely ordinary fairness and decency demands that such a personage should disclose his personal interest in the campaign in which he is participating against this Government and against the establishment of an Australian Government insurance office that will, after all, belong to and serve the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 2 year period, as a matter of judgment, gives proper respect to the institution of marriage, as I believe the majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would require and as clause 43 of the Bill requires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it is an affront to a substantial section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to say that a judicial separation will be denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not want the total picture presented to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As my time is limited, I want to emphasise that the only fair and reasonable way of handling this matter and of convincing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that there is nothing devious in what the Government is doing, is by having a cognate debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is no reason why the Government should take the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, their economy and their future, with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether the Australian Government Insurance Corporation will be a viable proposition or not will depend upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the business the Corporation attracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Government put its mind to protecting the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from the disasters which are mentioned in the legislation and let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> manage their business affairs it would be doing a good job for the private enterprise of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not leave the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the situation in which they are now in Darwin and in which they have been in all the floods- whether they have been in Tasmania, Brisbane or anywhere else- suffering major loss and not being compensated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is not acceptable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  should attempt to absolve himself from the moral responsibility of assistance to these people by passing the buck onto a United Nations organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In December 1972 and again in May last the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> elected an Australian Labor Parry Government which was, in its own words, to be a government of compassion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, its behaviour over the question of the Vietnamese refugees could only lead even a biased observer such as myself to conclude that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been sadly misled in their expectations regarding the policies of this so-called Government of compassion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People realise that their talents are properly made available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in government corporations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With an Australian Government Insurance Corporation the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can be certain that they will be able to insure against all contingencies on the best economic conditions available and that anybody employed by the Corporation will be treated with respect by his employers, by the Corporation, and will be serving the Australian public well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that, on the basis of first principles, the Liberal Party and the National Country Party must disagree, and because the ‘Age’ agrees with the Labor Party it must be right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But honourable members opposite have not given us one iota of evidence that in the party room, where this matter was decided, there was anything but an extraordinarily united stand on this issue- an issue which is important for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and an issue which, of course, is important to the point of anguish for all members of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The greatest gift that all Australian Labor Party members could give this nation would be to give up their seats, but I do not see them rushing in to make what would be their sole valuable contribution to the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable members opposite that the variation of 10 per cent above or below the quota was endorsed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at an election and was passed at a Joint Sitting of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, as a result of the Liberal Party again capitulating, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be denied these boundaries, but only temporarily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members can take it from me that, as sure as night follows day, ultimately these proposals will be accepted by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and by this Parliament, at a Joint Sitting if necessary, or because we will have a majority in the Senate in due course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have reeked with party politics and they have done everything possible to poison the thinking of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> against the country people and the National Country Party members who represent the majority of those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are not getting a decent representative administration on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; all we are getting is a presentation that one would think emanated from a Labor Party political meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition is well aware of these facts, yet it continues to attempt to mislead the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by false claims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It explains technical terms and I believe gives very important information to the House and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the scheme we are discussing optometrists will have a moral obligation to their profession and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because obviously greater use will be made of their services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The trouble is that the Labor Government has not realised that it is not a matter involving only a few people, a small industry, or an insignificant amount of money; the wool industry involves the lives and livelihoods of a large number of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps, in that way, the Acting Treasurer thought that the Exchequer and the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> might best be protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They ought to be trying to bring to the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian Government the advantages that private enterprise practices can achieve and the economies of scale that are derived from the size of purchasing power, efficiency in purchasing and expertise associated with the whole industry of purchasing which large companies utilise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Purchasing Commission will give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, through the Australian Government, just that power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can only congratulate the efforts that were made by the members of the committee of inquiry and, in all fairness, the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren)  deserves full credit for the efforts he has made to awaken the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to their responsibility to protect the National Estate, to conserve our resources and to conserve and protect where necessary our flora and fauna. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Government does to the National Estate what it has done to Fraser Island, to the Australian economy, to the rural industries, to the farmers and to the labour market, then the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have reason for deep concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true to say that for many years after the war, successive Liberal-Country Party governments were elected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on policies to increase our population, to broaden our economic base and to develop one of the highest living standards in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus there is reason to be concerned about the National Estate if the Whitlam Government continues to disrupt the Australian economy, fails to arrest inflation and unemployment and fails to stabilise the Australian economy to levels to which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> became accustomed under successive LiberalCountry Party governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most important tasks confronting the Commission will be to identify the sites that should be placed in the register, to develop adequate protection laws with the States to protect the sites and to educate the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to protect and respect the National Estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we should not forget that any gold for those people at the end of such a rainbow must be paid for in the long-term by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Their operations will be watched with great interest by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It may well be that members of the Government are being persuaded by their own propaganda that these measures are acceptable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These people were not persuaded by the mass of propaganda by which Government members have been persuaded that Medibank is good for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Medibank should not be forced upon an unwilling <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that any Australian will accept a Budget of that kind, but it is an example of the lack of understanding by the present Government of the sensibilities and the common sense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that that is what it is likely to do- to present the people with a budgetary deficit of somewhere between $2,000mand$4,000m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After less than 3 years of Labor Government the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s living standards are trailing behind those of other nations with similar economies who are members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What incentive have the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to work? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 objective of the platform of the Australian Labor Party- and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should really know about this- is: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If it does not cut Government expenditure it will load a deficit of $6,000m on the shoulders of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it little wonder that a government which has created its own disaster, which has sown the seeds of its own destruction, is now displaying inconsistencies and contradictions in trying to deceive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as to the truth of the real situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the people have had enough of the deceit, double standards and doctrinaire philosophies of those who are out to destroy an economic system that has given the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> such a high standard of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It came into office with a new program, a new deal for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are forced to ask: Where is the incentive for the worker, for the employer, for the industrialist, for the farmer or for any section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole of the device is to try to conceal from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the substance of the Government’s manipulation of electoral boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are vehemently opposed to the substance of the Bills and we believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> need to be told and deserve to be told about this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ought to understand that what is happening today, the course of action that the Government is following today, is yet another instance of a pattern of tampering with the rules of the electoral game which has been pursued by this Government since it took office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a very real sense it expressed the decision of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, because, as I have said, the BDI formed one of the grounds for the double dissolution and was therefore one of the issues put before the people at the elections in May last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And above all, it denies to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- Liberal voters every bit as much as Labor voters- the basic democratic right of equal representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Government is saying to this Parliament and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is: We want a redistribution that will allow us to obtain only 45 per cent of the vote and maintain our present number of seats and our position in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of Australia need to know that all the huffing, puffing and bluffing that is going on about a double dissolution and so on will not scare the Liberal Party or the National Country Party or bluff the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This smokescreen will not work, because I am sure that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will see from which side they are getting the fair go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Back came the Labor Party with the overwhelming majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> voting for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it is an alternative government by doing this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are waking up to what the Liberal Party is trying to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by issuing this warning: Last year when the Liberal Party thought it was going to win it took the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this matter becomes a double dissolution issue and goes to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the people will make the decision, and the Liberal Party will be the loser. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If that is not done it will be to the great disadvantage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It makes it abundantly clear that what the Opposition needs to do is to raise issues in this House as matters of public importance so that the Japanese may find out what is the real attitude of the honourable gentleman and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> may know what he is doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take the opportunity to point out that this is yet another indication of the aim of the Prime Minister to get his way, come what may, and in spite of what may be the clear indication of the vote of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and indeed of the sentiment of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by saying that there is no general demand by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for making this change to the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> already have to vote frequently because they are also called upon to elect members to the Parliaments of their States, in some States, for 2 Houses at different times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very few people will believe in the Prime Minister after his escapades relating to the cables that were sent to our embassies or officials in North and South Vietnam, which were shown to be totally different in substance and tone from the impression he tried to convey to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The essential constituents, ingredients and characteristics of a liberal democracy are certainty, continuity, a sense of responsibility not in the singular interests of a political party, not in the interests of the Parliament itself, but in the long term national interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think the Labor Government today represents the long term interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and I deny that it is operating and acting administratively or legally in their long term interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And according to those who wrote ‘The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth’, Quick and Garran, there is a necessity to ensure that the Parliament itself, whether in the House of Representatives or in the Senate, reflects the mature and long term views of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody who thinks or cares about the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can doubt that the Senate, particularly since 1972, has acted with the highest sense or responsibility when dealing with the many measures that have come before it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all there is a necessity to ensure that when considering changes you must always ask yourself the basic question: Is the change in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> or not? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have no doubt that on a mature view this proposed change we are considering would be contrary to the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was to ensure that the Prime Minister or the Government of the day could not intimidate or blackmail members of the Senate by threat of a double dissolution or by any other means when exercising their constitutional powers, to ensure that the Senate is a States’ House reflecting the views of the States and a House of review having all the qualities and power that a House of review needs to express the mature view and the long term attitude of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to constitutional change and the business of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to ensure that the Senate can act independently and in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those reasons I will do what I can to sustain the Senate’s prestige and power and to prevail upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to support our action against this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Presumably because Government supporters are quite certain that if they submit their case to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the normal course of events the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not be prepared to accept that case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, honourable members opposite try to get simultaneous elections to reduce the power of the Senate not because they really see the matter as urgent and not because the Constitution is inadequate but because they are intentionally trying to give to the Labor Government a security of tenure which its actions should deny it and which I am quite confident the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> equally will deny it the next time it goes to the polls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment which we have moved, that is, that the operation of the Act should cease on 1 July 1 976, is intended to put an end to the tunnel so that the Government and the Parliament can turn their minds to establishing a better, permanent arrangement to meet this constant burden which has been placed on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in general and on Australian exporters in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What must also be said, and said to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> very loudly, is that the blame for weaknesses in the disadvantaged schools program must be laid squarely at the feet of the State government departments and some local government bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Motor vehicles would be the only way by which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be able to move around and we would have the problems that have been referred to by the honourable member for Robertson who is the  Chairman  of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety which is doing such excellent work in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of that, we do not have a proper reorientation of Government policies; we have a band-aid approach to paper over the cracks and to try to hide from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the impact of the failure of Government policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That promise with respect to industrial unrest was a mirage and a myth as is so much else of what the Government has sought to do or promised the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it would do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Prime Minister has no confidence in his own Ministers, how can companies like APPM, how can industry, how can the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and particularly the Australian who is now employed and does not know whether he will be next on the list of unemployed have confidence in a government in which the Prime Minister himself says he has no confidence? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The taxation burden has to be reduced, and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> need to believe that a firm and determined Government is in power, not a politically irresponsible rabble such as we have seen over the last 48 hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now it has been presented to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a free speech issue; but should terrorists who have attacked and slaughtered innocent civilians be granted the right of free speech, especially when their speech and their actions are aimed at the destruction of a democratic state which we sponsored and support? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would hope that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would at last see the importance of this arrangement and recognise that the undertaking that is given to the industry in accordance with the present marketing plan is not being paid for out of the taxpayer’s pocket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The issues are vast and the welfare and prosperity of most of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> one way or another is involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We want the elected representatives of this country to be able to present their views and to act in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During this period the Government knew that the deception was being practised on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasised that we would press ahead with our programs in fulfilment of the undertakings we had given to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is very much a time to keep those achievements in mind, to put the record in perspective, to reflect on the basic strength and prosperity of the nation, the underlying strength of the economy, the real gains we have made in social reform and social justice and in the living standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever we hear criticism of this Government’s policies remember this simple fact: The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have never been better offbetter off in the money they have to spend, better off in their real incomes, better off in the range of services and opportunites available to them from this Government’s agencies and programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real prosperity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> lies increasingly in the quality of the services governments provide for the whole community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their benefits will soon be flowing to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the particular groups who need them- the low-income earners, the children, the sick, the handicapped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I leave the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to judge these tactics for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in this most secret of all secretive governments anywhere we will never understand what goes on behind the closed doors of this Government because it is not prepared to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> really what its concerns are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That again was a gentle misleading of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because in constant seasonally adjusted figures in the last quarter for which statistics are available private investment fell by $100m, as it has fallen for each of the last 5 quarters in real terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that was misleading the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then he said that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have never been better off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are matters which I believe need to be considered very carefully by this chamber and by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Equally, there was no aspect of our program which received more support from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in 2 elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-91-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw our opportunity through which the objectives so strongly supported by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the last 2 elections could be pursued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-91-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purposes for which we sought the loan command the clear support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-91-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have shown their clear support for our objectives in promoting Australian control of Australian resources, which in the final analysis is nothing short of Australian control over Australia ‘s destiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-91-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the perspective of these great objectives, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will despise the pettiness, the self-serving, of those who have chosen this issue to undermine the fulfilment of those objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-91-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ten per cent or even 50 per cent of the truth is as good a way of misleading this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a downright lie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 13 November 1972 the then Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Whitlam,  put the following questions to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>: ‘Are you prepared to maintain at the head of your affairs a coalition which has lurched into crisis after crisis, embarrassment piled on embarrassment week after week? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-129-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is some substance to the arguments which the Press has brought forward and which have produced a situation of crisis, as there is today within the Labor Party and the Government as a result of the Government trying to conceal or hide the facts from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, this Government and individuals in it are deserving of whatever criticism they get from the Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-139-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to you  Mr Deputy Speaker  and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that this matter cannot be shut up as the Prime Minister would like it to be shut up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-139-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that it is deceitful to come before this Parliament and try to tell us and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Government intended to get Loan Council approval. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-139-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the Senate is of the opinion that the Government has failed to give the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a proper, full and accurate account of the activities of its Ministers, servants and agents, relating to all dealings by them both prior to and subsequent to the Executive Council meeting of 13 December 1974, which authorised the Minister for Minerals and Energy to borrow a sum not exceeding four thousand million dollars in the currency of the United States of America for temporary purposes, and because the Government refuses to appoint a royal commission with proper and adequate terms of reference to investigate and report upon all aspects of the Government’s overseas loan activities, the Senate resolves: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-139-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would clearly show to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what happened to this money, this question of efficiency and this question of what was the best way to renegotiate loans, and not leave us in this muck raking exercise with accusations being made that with the former Government it was always right and with the present Government it is always wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750709_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-139-13">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Apparently the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  does not believe that it is futile to put referenda proposals to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, although I believe that certain branches of the Australian Labor Party’s organisation throughout Australia believe that it is futile to do so because the Prime Minister was criticised for doing so at the time of the last double dissolution campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-81-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have in this Bill an attempt by the Government to fasten this trade union dictatorship not just around the necks of the trade unionists but around the necks of all the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the attempt to make this kind of corruption permanent for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government- the sponsor of this Bill- has used the need for amendment as a means of launching a treacherous attack on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unions use that money ostensibly for industrial purposes, but actually, as all honourable members know- every honourable member on the other side of the House knows this very well- every year those millions of dollars are being used all the time in a continuous campaign of the big he to distort and to corrupt the views of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government proposes in this Bill, which I hope will be thrown out because it deserves to be thrown out, to still every political voice which would be opposed to the views which it puts forward and which it had the trade union megaphone to din continuously into the ears of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> not know the source of political funds in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that this message is getting through loud and clear to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They hold and hold firm- for the Australian Labor Party, for the Australian Government, for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must remember that we are in the curious position of being both developed, in the sense of a high living standard with a manufacturing capacity, and underdeveloped because of our massive raw resources which we need to put to the use of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to improve our standard of living and our capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, members of the National Country Party are supporting this Bill today only because they are afraid of the wrath of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who want Australia owned by Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the Foreign Takeovers Act of 1972, has continued up to the present time, merely shows the difficulty which the present Government has had, despite what it told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in December 1972, in formulating an effective foreign investment policy for this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the honourable member for Moreton and the other honourable gentlemen who sit opposite do not believe that the commander of an Australian force should be there by a convention but believe that his position should be there by a statute of this Parliament in which his powers are laid out by the elected representatives of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> so that in the event of a crisis he may thoroughly command the Australian forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there is nothing unusual in the legislation which lays down that the direction of the Services is under the control of an elected representative of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who sits in this Parliament and who is a Minister of the Crown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is disappointing to me that I have had to rise and support the honourable member for Curtin in bringing to the notice of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the very great discourtesies that have emanated from some ministerial offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are faced today with a blatant attempt by -this Government to eat away at the fundamental rights of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is most important that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are given an explanation of the Austraiian Government’s attitude towards the Palestine Liberation Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to an explanation of the Government’s policy on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 suppose one would have to be among the ranks of the most optimistic in Australia to assume that honourable gentlemen opposite will be in government at that time, but they are speaking on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at this moment and the assumption is made that an agreement already existing can be curtailed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is another example of the hypocrisy and the deceit of the Labor Party in government and its lack of purpose in stating the principles of foreign policy honestly to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that that is probably the message of tonight for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe they did a great disservice to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to Australia’s role in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those 3 extensions are where the left wing has either been done in the eye or the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are being completely hoodwinked by the assertions that the Government has been able to achieve some remarkable extension of Australian sovereignty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed in their manufacturing policy and economic policy they are denying the ability of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to produce the goods and the equipment which might be needed in the event of a future conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without any doubt, from this side of the House and from the overwhelming proportion of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the answer will be: ‘Yes, we will provide facilities and bases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember the debates in 1963 on this very important issue that affects the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is why at the time the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were so concerned, although Australia, like many countries in the Western world, was then still enveloped in the Cold War. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this legislation provides is for the Austraiian Government, on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, to have a greater say in the use of the base. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The damage that it is doing to the security of Australia will be remedied shortly by a change of government, and the United States and our other allies in the free world will know that once again Australia will have a government which represents the view of the overwhelming majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on this issue, which will not twist and determine Australia’s foreign policy in the interests of the communist powers to the control of the left wing, that minority pro-communist control, which apparently is still so potent over the thinking of the Government when it comes to foreign poliCY <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> went to an election on the issue and, in point of fact, the South Australian Government lost 3 country seats, if I am not mistaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot understand what the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> think they are going to get out of this, apart from it giving a bit of relief to the South Australian Premier’s budgeting problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But he has misled the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on this point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the simple fact is that the Prime Minister has misled the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that Don Dunstan on being returned to office can say that he has a clear mandate from the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to go ahead with the Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is now an overriding obligation to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the truth about the budgetary situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that, and I believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would support us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an approach that will encourage the best energies of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  on behalf of the Liberal Party and the National Country Party, has offered to this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> an alternative to the Budget presented by the Treasurer  (Mr Hayden). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the decision the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have to make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was sustained in my political life for over 20 years by one firm belief and that was that the vast majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are good and decent people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of everything the Opposition has poured out in the Press and over the television and radio in recent months, 85 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have never been better off than they are today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the main I looked to the Western Australian Press which most Western <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believe is orientated to the Liberals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> recognise the sorts of proposals that have been put forward by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it will not be lost on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the cost to the community as a whole will be the cost of the Budget as it stands plus the savagely increased charges introduced by the Postal Commission and the Telecommunications Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not so simple as to believe that a charge made by a Government instrumentality will not affect their pockets or their net incomes, simply because that charge has been divorced from the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, it will mean that the cost to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of providing unemployment benefits for these people who are thrown out of work as a result of the policies of this Government - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure the honourable gentleman that there are many competent Australian journalists who would be prepared to undertake the risk to observe the conditions at first hand and report to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1974 the Prime Minister regained office by telling the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that Australia was the only country where inflation and unemployment were under control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This year the Prime Minister told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that no improper actions had been taken over the loans affair and that he would make a full disclosure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Australian public has become tired of this Prime Minister and his team of exhausted volcanoesdiscredited, lacking punch, lacking policy, rejected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and manifestly unable or unwilling to put forward the solutions required to set this country right once again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why was this not told to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition implied, when making his speech the other night, that they would abolish our proposals in respect of these commodities and that he would therefore give to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> another $1,1 91m in concessions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you have a man like that writing the Opposition’s speeches on the Budget, and he has been writing the prospectus and other things for Patrick Partners, why would not this Fraser Budget be a misleading Budget for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All that we can do today is to send our best wishes and the best wishes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to  Mr Somare  and his Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Papua New Guinea’s imminent independencethen it is of very real concern to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is, of course, a very real problem in the lack of responsibility by Ministers in this Government and the concern that I wish to express is one on behalf of all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, costs to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have escalated because of production lost through prolonged industrial disputes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The preservation of the security of Australia as a free and democratic nation and the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, promoted through a sound economic policy with justice to all sections, are the paramount responsibilities of this national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget that has been brought down by this Government does not do anything towards providing that real and necessary objective in the interests of the nation and in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as that we have included Medibank in the Budget, which covers all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for medical and hospital care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By reforming the income tax scale with the pretence of benefiting lower and middle income earners, the Government is just hoodwinking the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is entirely in tune with the wishes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when they voted for our Government and for the major programs by means of which we promised to make good the neglect of 23 years of mismanagement prior to 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In many respects it has taken until the speech delivered by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren)  for this House to recognise just how indebted this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  last Tuesday night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In contrast to the Treasurer the Leader of the Opposition was honest enough to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> just how serious the economic situation is at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless there is a significant transfer of assets from the public to the private sector of the order outlined last Tuesday night by the Leader of the Opposition we will just not get that economic recovery which all members of the House, I hope, will work towards, and which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want and are entitled to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that is very cogent evidence of the real concern of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about the problems that we presently experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That speech gave to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a clear choice between 2 philosophies and 2 approaches, a choice that none of us on this side of the House equivocates about or is ashamed of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He rejected in his speech the proposition that governments have some inalienated right to determine how the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> shall spend the money they have earned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody will argue that government services are not essential, but we argue very strongly that what has gone wrong with this Government is that more and more it has tried to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> how they shall spend their own resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We reject that type of approach because it encourages a mendicant mentality on the part of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- a handout mentalityand discourages those in the community who want to make their own decisions about the way in which they will spend the resources that they earn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that when we are in power we wm be trying to achieve with what will then be the Opposition a genuine bi-partisan policy on what is probably, unhappily the most vital problem in front of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is really the message that the Leader of the Opposition is trying to put across to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I leave those thoughts with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and remind them of the record and attitude of the Opposition and its leaders prior to 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> now know that an Australian Government can provide these basic amenities and that we are doing it <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not the sort of thing that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> love, my dear sir. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> be the judge of that sort of comment; let events prove whether the Prime Minister’s assessment of the situation was sound or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should understand also that the Frazer philosophy is that these things can best be provided by each individual for himself or herself rather than by relying on the Government to provide them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> realise that we are going through a testing time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The response of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the offices already in existence proves that they welcome the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the regrettable features of his speech was that he saw fit to avoid completely any mention of the unemployed, the suffering that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have encountered as a result of the inflation rate which has wracked Australia in the last 3 years, and a number of other factors with which we are all familiar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are prepared to sit down and to study fully the ramifications of the recent Budget they will recognise that the benefits which are claimed by the Treasurer  (Mr Hayden)  to be existent and underlined by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  are really nonexistent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is trying to increase its actual income from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal-Country Party Opposition, as a result of 3 years in Opposition, has learned some of the lessons that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were hoping it would learn in 1972 when they tipped us out of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> simply want sane government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a tragedy for medical research in Australia and for the future health of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because that $8m provided last year was already a reduced level of research expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed if the Government so truculently claims to have a mandate to implement virtually any whim or dogma, surely it should accept that it has a mandate or contract to keep its word and to keep faith with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> whose vote it courted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have gone out of our way to indicate that when the Government secures higher prices and profitability for the extractive industries the sum of the rake-off comes to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By this legislation, some of the money paid in levies will be returned to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, where it belongs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They belong to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some of it must come back to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> be the judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The actual yield to the Australian Government and through it to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, will be an estimated $69m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would hope that this upturn will continue and that in a few months time, by the beginning of next year, we will see a reduction in the number of persons unemployed, a slowing down in the rate of inflation and a return to the stable conditions which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His parrot-like reiteration of patronising but rather lumpy opaque references to the performances, philosophies and policies of the Government proves conclusively once and for all to listening Australia that the Labor Party’s initiatives are both suffocatingly narrow and a recipe for lowering the quality of life of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In clear unequivocal statements, the Leaders from our side of the House detailed the paths that we will take to restore Australia and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the dignity and credibility that Australia had until December 1972 both within this country and overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are strongly and resolutely opposed to the Labor Party’s preference for social welfare and wealth redistribution instead of production and productivity, and to its preference for irresponsible Government spending instead of the meaningful and rewarding jobs which we plan to give to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having heard  Mr Fraser  speak last Tuesday week I repeat that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must know exactly where they stand when they are looking at the fortunes of either of the main parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore there feU upon the newly elected Government the mighty task of adjusting some of the inadequacies meted out to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> during 23 years of dominating, suppressive Liberal rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Quorum formed)  Our young men were sent to fight and often died in a war that was directed and governed by powers outside of the interests of the majority of the Vietnamese and <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- a war in fact that was perpetuated by capitalistic interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was done in the face of endless rabid criticism from the Opposition which having involved the people of Australia in a bloody inhumane battle, could only offer platitudes and criticism for the Labor Government which was, as the greatest number of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were, conscious of the depth of the humanitarian needs that dominated the Vietnam scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  referred in a recent Press statement to the report of the Henderson inquiry and to the dreadful things which the present Government allegedly is perpetrating on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had to backtrack on the pensioners, on its pre-school policy and in just about all those areas of glamorous reform that it offered to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are asking for $2 and $6 a tonne in respect of these coals so that we may siphon off a sum of $130m to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who deserve some benefit from the windfall gains of American companies operating in the coal export trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thereafter it will be possible for the Government to treat with  Mr Clunies  Ross to see that his estates can be acquired by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on just terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we have 2 drilling rigs which are ideal for the purpose and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a very large stake in them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> might have a hard look to see what they are faced with if the alternative government on the other side of the House came to power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are sceptical of their politicians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is time the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> realised the difficulties under which members of Parliament labour arid the difficulties under which they confront increasing inroads on their time, increasing slabs of power in legislation, and increasing delegation to statutory corporations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to open government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we correct in assuming that the Treasurer puts before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the suggestion that in this country we can run Medibank at a cost of approximately $100 a head although in Canada the cost of running an equivalent scheme is approximately $300 a head? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to know the answers to those questions based on estimates and experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is to the eternal shame of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that so Utile was done in the past 200 years to better the lot of the Australian Aborigine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we should be one <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> irrespective of the colour of our skin or any other characteristics which we might possess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What worries me and what should worry the Government- but that is not the point; it should worry the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- is that the Aborigines in the north of Australia, whether they be in Western Australia or in the Northern Territory, are being debauched by a flood of money which they cannot sustain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that very shortly the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will wait with breathless anticipation for a new policy on the Australian Capital Territory from the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second myth that we must get away from is that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can derive greater benefit from the nation’s mineral resources by the direct participation of the Australian Government in mineral development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that a good start has been made and the Minister has put the development of these policies on a course which no Liberal-National Country Party government will be able to turn back at any time, because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not tolerate the selling out of Australia’s interests to foreigners or to anybody else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that he misled the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> fall for this 2 card trick, they are mighty simple. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe he did not but there is a good reason for explanation to this Par.liament and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> why AGL was not told the facts and why ACTU-Solo should have been given this privilege. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the real kernel of the battle that has been going on in the High Court of Australia; that is, the States have been standing up not for the interests of Australia or of the people of their States but for the interests of those people who currently hold the wealth in minerals and energy resources and they clearly are not the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A very important reason for this sad state of affairs is that in the region which I represent efficient industries have been developed which supply vital foods to <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are owned and operated by dedicated, hardworking Australians who believe that they have products which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> really want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government stands condemned in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for what it has done to destroy housing policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, the Opposition has the effrontery to indicate to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it is concerned for local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some 3000 businesses have gone out of operation this year and no twittering on the other side of the chamber will prevent those facts from being known to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the many records which this Government has established since December 1972 one record which perhaps has escaped the notice of the House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is the amount of litigation in which the Commonwealth Government has been involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> rejected this naked grab for power and an Australian Labor Party Government was re-elected with a comfortable majority in the House of Representatives and increased numbers in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognised that in certain areas it would be unpopular, but a government that is responsible has to make decisions on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, on behalf of the taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our Constitution requires that after there has been a census of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> there be an electoral redistribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sooner or later the High Court of Australia will have to do exactly the same as the Supreme Court of the United States of America and tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what has to happen so that in future we will not have redistributions at the behest of the National Country Party which will favour country people and result in smaller electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will not take the advice of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who have rejected referendums seeking to interfere with the electoral laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly has no real respect for the democratic rights of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, especially those who live outside the great cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is doing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a great injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the honourable member for Port Adelaide and Government supporters cannot really blame the result of the last Senate election in May 1974 on anything other than an expression of will by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the kind of system that honourable members of the Country Party want to force on this countryloaded, rigged and gerrymandered boundaries all designed to keep in power a party which cannot get a majority of the votes and which represents less than 10 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What we would like to know is why honourable members opposite think they cannot win the votes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and repose to a fair and just electoral system in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This legislation has the endorsement of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and of the joint sitting of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Will the Government ascertain what action it can take to avoid this impost being placed on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He has the misconceived belief that because Australians have indicated some difficulty in absorbing and understanding the monumental advances made by the Government towards a new way of life- despite the Government’s facing with the rest of the world in the last 3 years some of the most difficult problems that have ever been encountered- the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want  to  return to the dead hand of ultraconservative Liberalism which they unceremoniously rejected in December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In respect of the disclosures made by the Leader of the Opposition in his new document, ‘Fraser’s Federalism’, there is no doubt that should this policy be inflicted upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> we would see such a ridiculous situation with the collecton of tax and the administration of a dual system of taxation that not only would people be paying double taxation, as was clearly explained by the Treasurer  (Mr Hayden)  yesterday in answer to a question, but also in some instances people could be paying 3 lots of taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The implications of the proposal by the Opposition are vast and are frightening when it is considered that members of the Opposition expect the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to be prepared to accept their ill-considered, ill-conceived document, and they expect the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to give them an opportunity to put such a document into effect should their style of government again be inflicted upon the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Might I say that it is important for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to remember that the man who proposes this document is the man who in recent years was prepared to destroy 2 party leadersthe Leader of the Opposition in recent months, and previously, while the Opposition was in Government, his Leader, the Prime Minister of that day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are to sit back and allow their system of government to be capsized at the will of an Opposition wanting office regardless of the performance of the freely elected government of the day, this country is approaching a system of anarchy and this is something that the Opposition has always professed to despise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be leaping up and down in fury at the attacks that are being made upon them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In just  Vh  years this situation has been completely reversed- a fact which does not give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> any degree of joy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the Government: Get off the backs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and give them a chance- resign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Violence is the last thing this Government wants, it is the last thing that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want and it is the last thing that the members of the Australia Labor Party want, but if that ultimately occurs it will properly be seen to be the result of the actions of the present LiberalCountry Party Opposition in this chamber and in the Senate and it will be on their heads to carry the burden and the guilt of having divided a once proud nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe it is fair that an organisation, in making an application for a scheme to assist the Government in alleviating the unemployment situation in this country, should have to bear the brunt of additional costs for a scheme that it was only carrying out on behalf of the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matter is on the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When this Government is ordered by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to go it will leave behind it more Aboriginal families unhoused than when it came to office in 1972 so full of promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet today, after the Australian Labor Party has been in office for 3 years, the Opposition seeks to tell the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that all the problems associated with the needs of housing <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For argument’s sake, the fantasies of the honourable member for Boothby  (Mr McLeay)  here today and his valiant efforts in the last few weeks to propose something in an effort to con the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into believing are almost equal to the fantasies of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say that honourable members opposite will not succeed because they will not succeed in pulling the wool over the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ever again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some honourable members opposite certainly will have it before too long because when the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> next get their chance to speak I think there will be one or two honourable members opposite who will not be around this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to the fullest information and they are not getting the fullest information from the media of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would bring again before the Committee, the people and the relevant Minister the very real contribution that I believe the acquisition of satellite communications could make to the total communications network offered to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How long were the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to continue to subsidise the postal services to the extent that they did? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have moved this motion with the object of bringing home to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the appalling fact that this Government, and more precisely the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  with his henchman the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor),  will be judged, if their shabby history is ever recorded, as the architects of disaster for an industry which was the envy of the world, an industry that established us a Mecca for huge development and for rich investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second myth which we must get away from is that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can derive a greater benefit from the nation’s mineral resources by the direct participation of the Australian Government in mineral development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask for the support of this House and I ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to pay heed to this motion that I have moved; that is, that this Government should be condemned for its failure to encourage exploration activity to extend Australia’s known minerals and energy resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that if that same problem were here today they would have said that mineral resources belong to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, particularly when the resources are offshore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On what basis would one oppose legislation which was designed so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> might own and develop their own assets? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the efforts of the Minister- despite obstruction- a very genuine effort has been made to guarantee the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ownership of their own resources even if they have to buy them back, although it is a tragedy that such action is necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there must be a fair opportunity for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to own their own assets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remarks will be made during that debate but I cannot help but say that in the area of legal aid, as in many other areas, unless all political parties in Australia are prepared to accept the need for co-operative federalism, the need for a partnership between the Federal Government and the State governments, we simply will not be able to deliver to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the sort of services they are entitled to receive and there will be increasing dissatisfaction and discontent in the Australian community about the inability or incapacity of Federal and State governments to co-operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless we can create a climate of partnership, a climate of co-operative effort between the 3 arms of government in Australia, we are not going to match the aspirations and expectations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What an amendment like this proposes is to present to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a realistic and hopefully acceptable means of ensuring that the politics of confrontation can be minimised in working to meet the contemporary and future needs of government in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What was seen at that time was that there should be a whole package of constitutional amendments which would be put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we need to do is to look at this Bill and to ask: ‘Should this legislation be passed so that a referendum can be conducted of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of us who have taken an interest in the Australian Constitution over recent years, I believe, have come to the point of view that there is a great need for reform, and the referendums which have been put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> recently are an example of the desire of this Government to effect reforms to the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that if there are any difficulties as mentioned by the right honourable member for Bruce they can be quickly ironed out so that we can put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a very clear and decisive referendum proposal which will be carried overwhelmingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until the referendum in 1967 dealing with the breaking of the nexus and the changing of the powers as they applied to Aboriginal people in Australia was carried a referendum had not been put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the Attorney-General or any other member of the Government to represent to this House or to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that we are opposed to it is completely irresponsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the type of argument that the AttorneyGeneral invites the House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to accept in respect of legal aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the Opposition is concerned he is not going to be able to get away with that; he is not going to be able to misrepresent our position on legal aid and he is not going to be able to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that we are opposed to the provision of adequate legal aid services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have, however, moved an amendment that the Bill be referred to a joint committee of both Houses of the Parliament because we believe that the Bill as presented may not be the best or most efficient means of providing legal aid to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much has been said about the survey of the Australian Nationwide Opinion Polls Pty Ltd which is allegedly a document which says that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> support the programs proposed by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I dare say the survey was taken at a very considerable cost to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in order to provide justification for the Australian Legal Aid office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members turn to page 40 they will see that most <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when they consider the Australian Legal Aid Office are under a misapprehension as to what it is able to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The document clearly demonstrates that if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> understood the purpose of this Bill they would not support it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is important to the totality of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to the respect of the legal system which we all uphold for the legal aid system that we implement to be one which will genuinely give this quality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can never understand how people who claim to have the interests of Australia at heart object to a government’s trying to borrow money to develop Australia’s mineral and energy resources so that the benefit of those resources will reside with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but prefer to allow the multinational corporations in foreign countries to come into this country and spend the same amount of money to get a stranglehold on Australia’s mineral and energy resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Budget presented to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> this year is a dishonest and grossly misleading document. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we have seen by the latest figures, the Government stands discredited, dishonoured and despised by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How naive and how stupid does he think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are quite intelligent enough to number a ballot paper if they want to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Otherwise the opposition will continue to try to convince, persuade or con the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that this is the best system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Really, the argument that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> cannot mark a piece of paper one to three or four or five - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be able to work it out as they did in respect of the ballot paper for New South Wales Senate candidates at the last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> showed what they thought of such a proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It shows a very strange order of priorities when we have to involve ourselves in contesting a principle which has been contested so often before and about which our views are so completely known, when there are matters of great moment before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister is to introduce a former Bill which has been split into 6 segments and make 6 highly political speeches about them, of course the Opposition has to explain to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> why it takes the view it does in opposing most of the measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Humbug, cant and hypocrisy will not and should not in any way confuse the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We live in a very sophisticated and well educated society and I think it is quite insulting to the intellect of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to believe that they do not know for whom they are voting and for what they are voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right result is the one which is closest to the clear wishes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a theme that through unemployment, through inflation and through the slowing down of economic growth has resulted in a slowdown in the development of our urban areas, in the diversification of these areas, in the provison of more homes for those who want them and in the general upgrading of the facilities available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the cities and the towns in which they live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Knowing that it has done wrong, knowing that it has harmed the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, it is trying desperately by any unworthy manoeuvre to avoid an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When there is a universal judgment around Australia that this Government stands condemned for its actions, especially over the last 12 months; when there is a universal call around Australia for this Government to go to the people for an election, this Government has to use its synthetic temporary majority in this House to try to claim that it has the confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This House regrets the failure of the Prime Minister to apply the same standards to himself as he has demanded from his Ministers and that having misled the Parliament and the people he has refused to resign and subject his Government to the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Senate which must account for itself before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have made it perfectly clear that our proposition is to defer the Budget until such time as the Prime Minister is prepared to face the real judges- the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- as to who should govern this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Senate is doing is allowing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to decide who will be the government of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is not more unmistakable evidence that the Government had doubts about itself and has a lack of confidence that it can win the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s support than a motion in this place seeking support for the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does he not go out into the real arena and face the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and see whether they will give him support? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How long are the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> going to put up with this uncertainty and with this man doing anything to remain in office knowing full well that this is his last chance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he is just going to delay and delay and cause the hardship that the Treasurer  (Mr Hayden)  is trying to threaten the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with -  ( Government supporters interjecting). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is going to be delay and double elections as a result of the Prime Minister refusing to face the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> then it is they, the members of the Labor Party, who will suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government realises that it has lost the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is time that the Labor Party as a whole, if it has any wisdom, made a decision which is in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and of preserving our parliamentary institution as well as its parliamentary party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why I and my ministerial colleagues stand solidly behind the Prime Minister in this, the most important fight of his life, the most important fight that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have ever fought in their lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the sort of man who is now putting himself to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as an alternative to the present Prime Minister, a man who will tear to shreds all of the conventions that prop up the institution of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, however, we feel quite justified in stating before this House that a government which declares itself to be in favour of a policy of open government, which declares itself to be in favour of advising the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as much as it can on the reasons why actions have to be taken, should inform this House and therefore the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as to why the Prime Minister considers it necessary to change the administrative arrangements concerning the conduct of the affairs of ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish merely to make it quite clear that no State can maintain its sovereignty unless it has a system of internal surveillance such as ASIO to defend the state against those persons, both within and without, who want to see the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> lose their freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the present Opposition came into power it put the security organisation under the control of a military person- I think it was  Colonel Spry-  who was not trained to the same degree as a member of the judiciary in the freedoms and rights of the British people, which applied also to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That this Bill be not further proceeded with until the Government agrees to submit itself to the judgment of the people, the Senate being of the opinion that the Prime Minister and his Government no longer have the trust and confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because of- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That this Bill be not further proceeded with until the Government agrees to submit itself to the judgment of the people, the Senate being of the opinion that the Prime Minister and his Government no longer have the trust and confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because of- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a very serious problem and it is brought upon this House, upon this Parliament and upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by the rapacious ambitions of just one man who is prepared to hold Australia and the defences of Australia to ransom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rights of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must be established- now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past few days the  j  <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have already demonstrated ( that they grasp clearly what is at stake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government, so long as it retains its majority in the House of Representatives, will continue the course endorsed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in May last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will stand up for the rights of this House and the rights of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even when the Labor Government was returned at that poll the Opposition parties still refused to accept the judgment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate is now asking for the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to throw the present Government back to the polls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since then, what other conventions have the Opposition parties broken, which they think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will accept? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Opposition parties are asking the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to accept the way in which the Senate is constituted at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  argument crumbles to the ground when we ask him: ‘If you are so confident why do you not go to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and let them decide?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>course he is panicky and he is hysterical because .he- is frightened to face his masters, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is trying to back him up on what is now a completely illegal stand by saying that the Senate has not got the power to force the Government to go to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This man cannot any longer be trusted by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today he has not got the courage because he knows only too well that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> now know their Prime Minister; they know that he is not a man of integrity, that he is not a person fit to govern this country any longer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This power was not put in the Constitution just to create some inconvenience for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Government should win this issue and create a precedent, this great safeguard, this great protection for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be taken away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be destroyed because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not allow the Senate to have its authority taken from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It no longer will be able to apply the brake and the restriction which there must be if there is a government with an obsession to push its centralist and socialist views on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will take this Government on if it wants to corrupt and break the Constitution because in the long term the message will get through to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the honourable member for Moreton said that while we have a majority in this Parliament we should not be forced to face the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the behest of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not supported in this great issue only by Australian Labor Party members of Parliament or the great majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If as the Prime Minister said, honourable members opposite were to read today’s Melbourne  Herald  and other newspapers they would find that they have completely miscalculated the temper of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian People</span> do not want an election every time a Senate seems to be different from the Government of the day in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite sell their principles, like the honourable member for Moreton in order to seek power by any means no matter what that does to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter what might happen to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on this issue, the full responsibility lies with those opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is the one who is leading this Government, who has allowed this shadow of dishonesty to descend upon it, and he is the one who must take responsibility for the burden that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are apparently at his hands going to bear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where was he when the former Government, which he now supports, lied to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That shows a reckless disregard for Australia, for the Australian economy and for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But they will not fool the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will find that they cannot snatch power in Australia and that the only way to gain election to the Government benches is to wait their turn and to submit themselves at the proper time for election by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their proposition is that the Government should make it easy for them and that the Government should deny those who elected it and should now give the Opposition the opportunity, if it can, to mislead the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are turning out in their tens of thousands to voice their opposition and their disapproval of this wanton vandalism which the Opposition is trying to perpetrate on the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has been elected twice by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is a man who destroyed others and he himself will be destroyed, if not by his own party, by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who will not tolerate vandalism and will not tolerate irresponsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one has told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what is wrong with trying to raise money overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He cringes from the bar of justice which will pronounce his guilt and his disgrace- the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian ballot box. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At such time as we do meet the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> we will not have to meet them on the basis of what happened in 1900 when the Australian Constitution was passed by the British Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition will meet the results of what it is doing in this Parliament today when it meets the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in 1975, or at some time in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He would, I believe, endorse and applaud the appointment of  Mr Justice  A. E. Woodward as the new Director of Security, and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ought to be reassured that there will be no telephone’ tapping warrants issued in Australia unless  Mr Justice  Woodward makes that recommendation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the present time the market shows that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are very favourably disposed towards 4-cylinder motor cars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 4-cylinder engine industrial development will be a great advantage to the Australian industry, a great advance for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, a most welcome addition to South Australia and an advantage to Chrysler. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those opposite are breaking down all the tenets of the Constitution in an endeavour to wreck a government that seeks to make known to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the forces behind the Opposition parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no change in our position and there will be no change because there is no other way in which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can be given the opportunity to judge the Whitlam Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will do this because there is no other way that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can be given the opportunity to judge this disreputable government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purposes for which we sought the loan command the clear support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no longer tenable for this Government to say that it commands the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it believes that then let it have the courage to go to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and test it at the ballot box. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe- I put this to the House with the same sincerity as the views expressed by the Minister for Overseas Trade- that this Government and its leader, the Prime Minister, have misled this House, have been guilty of dishonesty and have misled the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the basis of the Opposition’s case- a case which we put to this House and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- that the behaviour of this Government and particularly the behaviour of its Prime Minister and 2 former senior Ministers was so abnormal as to justify the Senate using the power which has been given to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to the House also that there is no attempt by the Opposition to gain government other than in the only way in which any party can gain government in this country, and that is by obtaining the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ask for one thing, and that is for the Government to test the stand it takes, to test its record, to test its credit with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the belief of the Opposition and, I am sure, the belief of a growing number of people throughout Australia that the Government is unwilling to test its standing with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude my remarks by saying again that the Opposition says to the supporters of the Government that ultimately this dispute must be resolved by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that there is a clear responsibility on the Prime Minister at least to dissolve the House of Representatives, to dissolve both Houses if he so wishes, that it is a deadlock between the 2 Houses of the Australian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751022_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Prime Minister realise that the promise of open government was one of the main reasons why this Government was mistakenly elected to office by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- a mistake that they are anxiously waiting to rectify? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  said at question time this morning, the primary obligation of this Parliament is to pass the Budget and to see that people are not inconvenienced and caused suffering and hardship because of any actions of this Parliament, particularly by a government which has the confidence of this House and of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and because of actions of those in the Senate who are stopping the passing of the Budget without the courage to reject it- just deferring it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only thing that stops us from bringing in effectively a full curtailment of office holders’ facilities is the inconvenience which would be caused to members of the Opposition because we want them to have every opportunity to put their infamous case to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as long as the Opposition turns us into another Portugal, which is the sort of thing that is happening in the crisis which it has created, there will be no cure, there will be no stability, there will be no hope for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to steadily overcome this world malaise from which we are suffering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The memories of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not so short. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Senate being of the opinion that the Prime Minister and his Government no longer have the trust and confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because of- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751023_reps_29_hor97/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister interpreted figures before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in a way which was entirely false. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has resulted unfortunately in a tendency for so many of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to conclude that the nation begins in Adelaide and ends in Brisbane and that there is not very much on the other side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that sense the loan which is now before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> I believe it may have closed yesterday and the loans which will be before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> within the next number of month represent as big a problem here as did the famous loan which was negotiated during the height of the Depression and which involved the proposition whether repudiation would be a fact of Australian life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Senate is doing is giving the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- our masters- the opportunity of deciding who should continue to run this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we have this Government dishonestly trying to present to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the belief that it is the Senate which is going to cause hardship to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate is acting in a way which is trying to protect the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> against a disreputable government- a government which for reprehensible reasons should be compelled to go back and face the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Look, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are seeing through the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is punished by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is what will happen if it has acted correctly and acted according to the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The second reading debate on these Bills has been totally aborted because the Government has refused to present to the Parliament in a fit and adequate form one of the most significant of the measures that lie before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-12-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> recognise the degree to which they are being misled by a government of this character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-12-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret that the petulant actions of the Opposition in this House and in the Senate have stifled proper consideration of the financial arrangements between the Australian Government and the State governments, that they have made it difficult for further advances to be made, that they have further clouded the issue by holding over the head of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the threat of a system of double taxation whereby they will have to pay tax under what has become accepted as the Australian taxation system and the State governments will, as they wish, be able to impose extra taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to know where he is getting his alleged leaks, how much is being paid for them, who has been paid or will be paid and who has footed the bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not fools, and they are entitled to know who brought  Mr Khemlani  to Australia, who organised his trips, what was the inducement and who paid it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I challenge the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would like to know the answer and I am sure that this chamber would like to know the answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 and 2, which are inter-related with the legislation before the chamber, are blocked in another place the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> need to be told that I was also asked by a very responsible person why the Australian Government wanted to replace existing foreign equity in our resources with Arab equity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of Australia at a referendum decided that they were not going to trust this corrupt, inept government to distribute funds to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An examination of these tables is a most enlightening one and serves to direct the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the real truth of the situation- the kernel of the matter- that the Australian Government debt has decreased in proportion to the debt applicable to State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, these are figures which cause very great concern and give great alarm to the average person in the street who is very concerned at the ever-increasing debt that is being perpetrated on the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the various State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the figures on inflation that the Government is putting out to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> this is the sort of rise in costs that we are seeing at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We stand by our belief in the fundamental rights of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and we are prepared to guarantee these rights by the creation of a Government vehicle to support our policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate not only has the constitutional power to refuse or to fail to pass a money Bill; it is, when circumstances justify it, the voice and instrument of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the voters throughout Australia may well indicate by very substantial majority their rejection of the Whitlam Government and yet that Government could gain a short term victory, and that would not indicate the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today the Leader of the Opposition came into the Parliament not to speak on the Bills before it but to apologise for the waning enthusiasm of his supporters in a campaign that has been condemned by all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eighteen months ago we took the Opposition to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and did it like a dinner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let there be no doubt in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Senate is stopping Supply by deferring it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although there are a few brilliant brains opposite not one of them could convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that we were the ones who had stopped the supply of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to this Parliament and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>: Have those doctrinaire members really made that discovery or is it just expedient for a short time to pretend to do so? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it is of tremendous importance not only to the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory but also to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole, and particularly those who live in the Northern Territory, that this measure be as wise and as effective as we can possibly make it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister now no longer believes that the Senate should have this power, is it not for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> themselves to decide whether the power is to be taken away from the Senate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, these sittings are for only one reason; that is, to see that the Budget is passed in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, accepts responsibility for their active and progressive rehabilitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can no longer be any doubt that the Opposition’s policy of blocking the Budget, of stalling the Budget and of going on strike in the vote on the Budget, has been rejected by an overwhelming majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because this Prime Minister is frightened to face his masters, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- and remains frightened to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That this Bill be not further proceeded with until the Government agrees to submit itself to the judgement of the people, the Senate being of the opinion that the Prime Minister and his Government no longer have the trust and confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because of- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Continuing to hide from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the full extent of the damage done to the economy and the inevitable hardships to be caused to its people; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that it is another decision that has been taken by the Prime Minister without prior notice or consultation and that it is another example of the dictatorial nature of the Prime Minister causing harm, mainly through economic mismanagement, not only to the employment of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and of businesses throughout Australia but also to our educational institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751106_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when added to that are the scandals, and the incapacity to set standards, this Government deserves the contempt of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the contempt of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And, of course, in so doing he would sell out the rights of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by the selling the people ‘s House down the drain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said 3 weeks ago that it would be my duty to make the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> aware that the Leader of the Opposition was, in his own description of the right honourable member for Higgins ‘unfit to be Prime Minister’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has tried this tactic several times recently but I am afraid he will have to get some new people into his ‘dirty tricks’ department if he thinks this will have any continuing effect on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us hope that if he wants to change this position and there is a referendum the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will see through it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will measure them for what they are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will smash the Senate all right and he will smash it right over the heads of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> if he can get his way; and he will smash the economy while he is at it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Democracy will be hurt if an arrogant, irrational Prime Minister destroys the Senate’s power to force a failed, incompetent, corrupt and disreputable government to face its masters- the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No other decision open to me would enable the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to decide for themselves what should be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would like only to add that I appeal to the good sense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to understand that a most difficult situation has developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751111_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that the Leader of the Opposition, by his innuendo and inference, demonstrates once more that he still fails to recognise the verdict of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on 13 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-4-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should learn some humility and that the judgment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is more important than that which he sought to impose on the previous Parliament and which he apparently still intends to endeavour to impose on this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-4-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They lie with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-4-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that as a result the Australian Constitution will be observed and the rights and interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-4-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having robbed the bank of integrity and obtained a majority in this House does not make the actions which preceded the election proper any more than the verdict of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in 1966 reflected what was proper and subsequently proved correct in those days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-4-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the decision of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the elections last December for both Houses of Parliament, my Government believes that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have given it a strong directive to bring under control the highest unemployment for forty years and the worst prolonged inflation in the nation’s history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at a referendum of May 1967 indicated overwhelmingly their view that this Australian Parliament has a special obligation to make laws for the advancement of the people of Aboriginal race; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760217_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is fair to say at the outset, on the basis of the judgment made recently by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that there has never been in the history of this country a government which has broken more promises in so short a period of time than did the Australian Labor Party in government in the course of the past 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government will not turn its back on the clearly expressed demand of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that inflation must be dealt with in a firm manner and must be dealt with now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have little trust of this Government after the short time it has been in office and, again, very little to reason to trust it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Should I say that he is showing himself, for his own personal gain, the enemy of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There will be no more grave, no more crucial decision taken by this Government than its deliberate breach of faith with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on wage indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is a government which will win not the trust but the abhorrence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When asked by a puzzled interviewer how the Government could so readily abandon quite firm promises to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>  Mr Fraser  said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that statement the Prime Minister bestowed on himself a licence to mislead the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conservative Premiers in 4 States deliberately set out on a course of frustration of the expressed will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, twice expressed in 18 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should never be allowed to forget the shabby intrigues, the misuse of power and the blatant denigration of honesty, integrity and morality which were used by power hungry men to achieve their tawdry ends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is our responsibility now to pick up the shreds of an economy which the Opposition left behind and to try to do something about creating an atmosphere in which Australian business, Australian commerce, <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in general, can get on with the job of utilising the great wealth and great resources with which we have been blessed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But now what the Government is doing- and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be made well aware of it- is robbing the pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>my Government believes that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have given it a strong directive to bring under control the highest unemployment for forty years and the worst prolonged inflation in the nation’s history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This brought about many problems for us as an <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We only have to look at the record of the former Government, as the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> did, to see it- inflation of record proportions; unemployment of record proportions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret that our colleagues opposite can so glibly ignore their record upon which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> passed judgment not so long ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It Will be able to offer to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> solutions to many of these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it to be the most desirable reform that any government could put before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will make governments truly accountable for the first time for the money that they raise from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also has to be seen in terms of the willingness of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally to give up something themselves to support other people in other countries whose circumstances certainly are not as good as our own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When governments are building welfare housing they do not have a responsibility to provide luxury waterfront accommodation at a welfare rate at the expense of other <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think honourable gentlemen ought to recognise that such projects should be the subject of further study- that is all I am saying- so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will know they are getting value for money, and so that those people for whom we have the responsibility to provide because they cannot provide for themselves are properly accommodated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Prime Minister give me details of his strategy in creating the super department by the amalgamation of the Departments of Environment, Housing and Urban and Regional Development and then pulling out its teeth by excluding it from the Economic Committee of Cabinet thus excluding this new department from having any say in Cabinet on economic aspects even though it is responsible for fixation investment in the cities of Australia which represent 85 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that at present the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> understand the very deep crisis into which this country has been plunged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> accept the desperate and almost dangerous state of the economy I do not believe that they accept that as a justification for the desperate and almost dangerous state of the defences of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is an issue which is not far below the surface with the vast majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Governor-General’s Speech is the first step towards achieving that objective for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and their sorely troubled but still magnificent nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part of the legacy is that 43 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> now have no respect for the Constitution or the parliamentary system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They reserved the right to select what they thought the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had endorsed, and in their view that was virtually nothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> fell for the line pushed by the Liberals and the Australian media that Australia alone could have been isolated from the world economic crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately time does not permit me in this debate to speak at length on the fraud that has been perpetrated on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by the policy of federalism under which the new Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  proposes to provide more money for the States and local governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to pay out the money of all the good working <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to provide benefits for the unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we see the election issues have been distorted in the way they have been conveyed to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The media barons who sponsored this Government into office want the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to forget the events of Remembrance Day 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Opposition will not rest until the facts are known and brought into public view and the guilty men exposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it needs to be remembered by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that every step taken by the Whitlam Government to bring under control the rapidly increasing inflation it inherited from the McMahon Government was bitterly opposed by the conservatives, the Liberal and the Country Parties, which are now in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was the verdict of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to honourable members opposite that until they get rid of the endemic disease of procommunism of one kind or another which has been with them since 1955 they will never be trusted for any long terms of office by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When he goes among the migrant community- in view of what he said, obviously he has not been there yet- he will find that it was not until the advent of the Labor Government in 1972 that the migrants in this country were elevated from a position in which they were brought here to do the dirty tasks, the unpleasant tasks and to fill the gaps in the factories in jobs which <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were a bit loath to take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will be an example of co-operative federalism which will benefit the Latrobe Valley in particular and ultimately the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His Excellency the Governor-General in opening the first session of the Thirtieth Parliament on Tuesday last stated that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have given the Government a directive to bring inflation under control, to create employment and to raise productivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> expect the Fraser Government to proceed with my Government’s legislation to secure land rights for the Aboriginal people and to override discriminatory laws in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the servant of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must carry this fight forward with us, and never be guilty of forgetting the injustice that was meted out to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on that day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now with the economic measures of this Government, I see a return to the social desert for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, a return to the 50s and early 60s- to the time of Menzies ‘ rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel privileged because I stand here having been elected to represent over 100 000 people of the electorate of Evans, an inner western suburb electorate of Sydney which contains a crosssection of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and therefore represents the aspirations and hopes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those noisy elements in our midst who would agitate for a sweeping away of our traditions do not represent and articulate the real feeling and aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore necessary to let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know that one of the principal reasons for the 50c increase in patient contributions to pharmaceutical benefits was the financial insanity of the previous occupiers of the Treasury bench. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one of the matters that brought the former Government into a great deal of disrespect in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may have been good reason for trying to standardise titles but the cost to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the continuous seeking to rename authorities and to bring about new titles for organisations was tremendous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is part of our heritage and the title, the name, is part of our heritage and it ought to be seen that way, particularly as nobody was prepared to go to the trouble of putting to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that we ought to change the title as it is known in the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were never asked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe this is important because the security organisation works in our own interests as a country and it will work in our own and our best interests only if it has the confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and if we can allow it to continue to function without it having to reveal what it is doing and the way in which it is undertaking its task, so destroying its capacity to undertake that task properly and in our own interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That requirement is the obligation- I believe the electorate and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in general feel this way also -on governments, when elected, to maintain full employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to why they felt so deeply as to the loss of the obligation to have full employment, I shall read 2 sentences from the obligation which governments undertook over 30 years ago in this place- to maintain conditions whereby the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> could have work and could have jobs if they decided to want work and decided to want a job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the weight of the public purse, the weight of the finance that had to be surrendered from each earned dollar to government in one form or another caused the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to say: ‘No, we are not going to persist in this kind of situation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I know that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are so intent upon money and so keen upon what is called ‘the smell of money’ that that is likely to be the direction in which we are to go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that as 1975 drew to a close a vast majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> wanted to be rid of the Whitlam Labor Government before it did more and perhaps lasting and irreparable damage to the country’s economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal and National Country Parties acted rightly in responding to the wish of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attempt of the former Prime Minister to prevent the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from voting was an undemocratic action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we come to the elections in 1978 I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will re-elect the Fraser Liberal-Country Party Government to keep Australia that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is imperative that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, regardless of which government is in power, acknowledge the need for the government to give urgent and generous assistance in many forms to Papua New Guinea, and to give that assistance now, otherwise we might find ourselves expending all sorts of large sums of money in regrettable episodes in an effort to retrieve a situation which could develop from our failure to support the present Papua New Guinea Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have had a relatively full employment situation and a full employment policy for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been demonstrated and judged by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to be a shambles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was it a terrible crime against the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to see that they got a better education? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Opposition can argue their heads off or go black and blue but there is no refuting the fact that there is this form of belief in the mainstream of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, it would be quite stupid if they ignored the obvious attraction of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to this sort of policy and did not describe to their local government areas, to their people involved in main street pressures for creches, for child care, for what have you, that these sorts of things will now have an ingredient of local government, an ingredient of the people making the decision and producing the pressure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among some of the cliches used were: ‘we must encourage self-reliance and common sense in the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’; ‘we must all work hard’; ‘we must be independent’; ‘we must stand on our own feet’; and ‘we must assert our great Australian individuality’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  feeble lamb’s bleat of trying to defend the indefensible was a poor response to the lion’s roar of the verdict of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on 13 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government believes that since resources are limited the crucial choice between government and private spending should be as far as possible an explicit choice, a choice which is clearly presented to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will appreciate that tax indexation is a far more effective way of protecting their earnings than seeking ever higher money wages which are soon eroded by higher prices which often lead to more unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was undertaking a cruel and deceitful fraud which inevitably led to disastrous inflation, but which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were able to perceive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commission is a long-established, highly respected institution, one whose actions and their consequences are closely watched by all the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>His Excellency,  the Governor-General, in his Speech, said that we aim to develop a role for government which places more reliance on the common sense and reason of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We do not believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want a government that takes over from them their responsibility for decisions concerning the manner in which they live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is to observe as we do in our prayers our duty to God, to stand up for the things which are right, to serve the people who have elected me here, to work for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as long as I am in this Parliament and above all to support and care for the traditions of this honourable House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want no part of foreign interference in our affairs, irrespective of the country of origin of that interference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I venture to say that immediately the Government reintroduces those licence fees, and if the Governor-General has the propriety to dismiss the Government for a serious deception of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, this Government also will go out on its ear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party must now realise that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> demand responsible government with the minimum of interference to people and to business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had given the present Government Parties a strong directive to bring under control the highest unemployment rate in 40 years and the worst inflation in our history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To believe, as they obviously believe, encouraged by the numbers of people they have in this chamber, that the overwhelming majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> support them is to delude themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government consistently lifted the expectations and hopes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and consistently dumped them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It lifted the expectations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to impossible heights and dashed them one by one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is obliged to do this for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What about the infamous proposal of 13 December 1974 to raise $4,000m for ‘temporary purposes’, the using of that phrase to avoid having to seek Loan Council approval and the proposed raising of those funds against a promissory note that would ‘lave put the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into hock to the tune of $ 19,899m? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, here we are now and the 2 Loan Bills before us are presented as monuments to the humbugging of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and of this Parliament by the then Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the tragedy, and that is the tragedy upon which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> made a judgment on 13 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is easy to suggest that there was nothing wrong with the business, that all that was wrong was the terrible Labor Government that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I join in this debate to support the excellent argument advanced by the Government and to reveal to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the shallowness of the argument of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 13 December last year the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> told the Opposition members that they did not want them to pocket the money which rightly belongs to rural producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not want a bar of the Opposition’s policies of export taxes on primary production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an excellent principle if we want the public health of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to remain at the optimum level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did not indicate the real truth of the proposition to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thenattacks on the working population by way of their wages policies, their proposed industrial policies, their increasing of unemployment as a fear weapon and their police repression of the Party of the Labor movement will not be tolerated by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike our predecessors, we intend to use the Parliament as a forum for economic debate and as the avenue for putting our economic program before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is little doubt in my mind that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were most frustrated and even scared in some cases of the trend the Australian nation was following under a Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> realise what was happening to this country as a result of inflation, unemployment, lack of confidence on the part of industry, with business after business running down and primary producers experiencing the worst period since the depression in the early thirties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  these honourable members must realise that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have spoken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sooner they forget this particular line, the sooner the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will begin to regain their confidence in the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly they want to forget their acts of constitutional violence and their action in discarding the conventional rules of political behaviour in this country and, more especially, they want the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to forget them too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be hoped that this shall be regarded by the Parliament as a national heritage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and will be funded accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The capacity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to participate effectively in the decisions of” government has been weakened  by certain trends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is something which is not generally understood by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it is a difficult language but to <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> any other language is difficult, including Queenslandese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a great deal of misunderstanding and misconception by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about the people of Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are quite noted for their capacity to travel to other places, and for the way that they do travel, but seldom do they travel north along the route to Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am afraid there still are a lot of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who caricature the Japanese culture as being that of the geisha house, mixed bathing, sukiyaki and the Datsun motor car. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That sort of information should be disseminated generally among the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking in terms not only of US$6m but in terms of much larger sums, a continuation of work for <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the retention of this important Australian industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since that time private overseas firms coming into Australia in place of bringing their own capital from their own resources, have in point of fact drawn resources from the Australian banking system, that is, drawn their resources from the savings of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, as I have said, it seems to me probably that over this period, although sometimes we raised loans overseas they were not as big as the sinking fund payments overseas plus the increase in indebtedness of foreign firms to Australian banks, because we allowed the foreign firms to mobilise the savings of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> which should have been kept for the Australian entrepreneur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the servant of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential that not only should the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> be aware and kept informed of the world around us and the circumstances, which change daily, but that the men and women who are elected to this Parliament with the fundamental responsibility of leading the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and of setting a standard of excellence and an appreciaton of the problems which this nation must face, should ensure that this Committee has indeed a real role to perform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must use this excellent opportunity to put our house in order so that if the time arises when a threat is upon us we will not be seen to be doubly guilty for having failed to discharge our duty to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> while the boat was not rocking but while we were waiting for it to start to rock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such plans would not involve excessive costs and would be capable of assessment by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as worthwhile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1967 referendum certainly gave, on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, an imprimatur to any Australian government to grasp the nettle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They may have been unrewarded by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for their services in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he please let it be known not only to the permanent building societies but to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole that the permanent building societies do have this right under section 8 (c) or (d) of the Reserve Bank Act and that it can be exercised with the discretion of the Reserve Bank authorities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> decided on us as the Government of this country on 13 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What about the usurping of the contract with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not going to put up with that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government expenditure was contained at a level which was sufficient to prevent erosion of many benefits the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had reaped under the Labor Government but which gave the private sector room to expand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the chances that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would benefit from the policies of the Labor Budget have severely diminished since 13 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The world recovery, which becomes more and more evident as each new set of indicators is released, becomes more and more remote from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> following each successive action of this Government in the area of economic policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has conducted a campaign of myth and half-truths to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that they are being harmed by the efforts of the public sector to improve the quality of their lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were misled into voting this coalition into power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These monetary policies of this Government, unless quickly modified, seem certain to deny the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the solid, if slow and steady, economic recovery that the last Labor Budget planned to give them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, if the Government revoked all policy decisions it has made since coming into office and allowed the policies of the last Labor Budget to run their course, with some inevitable adjustments to the money supply in the light of unfolding events, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> could yet enjoy the fruits of the worldwide recovery which threatens to escape them or at least threatens to be postponed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And finally, among these crucial issues, is the question of whether we, as a people, can find a renewed faith and commitment to our capacity to provide a decent life for every person while- at the same time- encouraging the very best that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can offer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I cannot conceive anything less likely to inspire the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to ‘a new idealism’ than . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought he had a strange capacity to con the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into believing that it was the second political coming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the attempt was correctly made in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The overwhelming rejection of the Labor Government was brought about by that Government’s gross underestimation of the intellect of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and that is putting it in the most courteous terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet it is just this relationship which will be crucial in the years ahead in determining the ability and value of the Parliament as an institution capable of reflecting the needs and aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party and the Labor movement together will do their part to make the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> truly aware of how the calculated actions of the conservative parties last November have seriously endangered the effective operation of democracy in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so far the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been fooled and confused by the machinations of the media as to the true colours of this Government, honourable members should recall the mention I made earlier of  Sir Robert  Menzies’ achievements, what he promised and what he did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want idealism to play a more important part in our politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have shown that they know this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have shown that they are a wake up to the situation under Labor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know full well that expenditure in this country has to be cut, that the rate of increase has to be cut. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I for one, as a member of the Australian Government, exhort and implore him to break his silence and to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> exactly his reasoning and his motives in dismissing the worst government since Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The sooner that straitjacket is cast off and the sooner more funds are made available in an area such as housing, where there is an underemployment of men and resources, the better will the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> be satisfied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no better way to improve the way of life of those we represent, as I said earlier, than to improve their housing, than to seek to fulfil the needs in this housing area, to improve the housing of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, rather than wanting to own their own homes, want security of tenure of premises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All I suggest to him is that he accepts democracy and the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the ballot box. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We witnessed many classical attempts to hoodwink the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and nowhere was this more prominent than in the welfare housing group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That type of dishonest approach to a delicate, sensitive and deserving section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is abhorred by all decent Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is pertinent to remind the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that in December 1974 the then Prime Minister, the  Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The great mass of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> showed quite clearly that they agreed with the Labor Party’s reforms in the field of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is extremely important that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> understand exactly what is going on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take issue with the Minister for Post and Telecommunications  (Mr Eric Robinson)  on the conflict and his obligation to come clean with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eventually the Minister or the Government has to make a decision on whether the ABC is going to be shackled and not able to act as an independent organisation in presenting to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that which they desire to see. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Well, on their showing at 2 recent elections the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not like the look of them much either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a recognised need to inform this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> how moneys granted for education purposes are spent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are the people- the good, sound <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- who turned to the Liberal and National Country Parties in 1975, and in few places was this turn more evident than in the electorate of La Trobe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the expectations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of shorter working hours, more pay and a much bigger slice of the cake have forced up the whole cost structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These people pointed out that these bounties are not handouts to farmers as the people who sit opposite try to inculcate into the hearts and minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These excellent debaters, full of logic and forthrightness, pointed out that these subsidies for phosphates and for nitrogen are consumer subsidies to enable the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have access to cheaper foodstuffs than they would have had otherwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe it borders almost on a diabolical act when those who sit opposite endeavour to portray to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> through this national Parliament that they are against the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> getting cheaper foodstuffs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How pleasant it was to find that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in December recognised that there was no point in receiving what was in fact counterfeit money- diminishing value money, bits of paper that were worthlessbecause in fact unless we have a thriving rural sector, a rural sector that is dynamic and going ahead, we cannot have a sound basis of prosperity in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How disappointed the 40-odd per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must be who voted for the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- At a time when we have more than enough economic and social problems to keep us fully occupied, it may seem untimely to ask the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to give some thought to longer term population goals and growth rates, including the desirable size and composition of our population at various stages up to the end of this century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This applies both to policies involving government services to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, such as education or social welfare, and to policies in which population is treated as a resource, such as the gearing of manpower to economic development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr CONNOR  (Cunningham) (8.36)- I enter this debate with considerable emotion and with considerable sympathy for a gravely underprivileged group of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one of the oldest men in this House, I well remember it and the scars that it left on the body politic of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only a government as obtuse, as backward and as benighted as this one would attempt to continue with the policy it has tried to foist on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ruminated on these words at a time when the dark shadow of arrogant Labor socialism was looming over us all, when increasingly we were being told what was good for us rather than being asked, when social causes were being confused with mindless vendettas and power-drunk men were thrusting the course of Australian life in a direction that their own prejudice dictated rather than in the direction that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will take decisions in accordance with the best interests of the health care of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this there is the possibility of raising the standards of living of all the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the  Deputy  Prime Minister has done a service by bringing to the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the importance of this tremendous resource. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> need to consider is whether we have the right to deny other nations access on fair and reasonable terms to our resources and, if we did that, would other nations feel that they had the right to seek, by whatever means they might consider appropriate, to try to get that access. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He tried desperately last November to incite the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to violence by using exactly the same ploy then as he is using now to try to drum up hostility in Japan to our Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is not working in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> surely we have the right, indeed the responsibility, to look at it and to change it if necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is no doubt in my mind that the transfer of wealth from the profit area to the wage area of the economy produced the great area of social satisfaction and greater quality of life for a large number of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly the honourable member for Chifley wants to see what happens in Parramatta in isolation from what affects the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole and he wants to try to say that this issue ought to be seen in isolation from the important matters that face Australia, such as our economy and employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the policies which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> asked this Government to implement we are going to see a transfer of resources from the public sector of the community to the private sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think the people of Parramatta can properly demand- and I am not demanding it for them- that a Government centre be built at great cost to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> which will be empty at completion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would want us to apologise for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this scheme is a tragedy not only for the many public servants who have served the people well over a long period and who want to retire in good health at age of 60 years but also for the Public Service itself, because the clock is being turned back on the considerable progress that was made under the Labor Government to make the Public Service a highly competent and well motivated organisation serving the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that it is in the interests of the members of the Public Service or the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to turn back the clock on the progress that already has been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The primary purpose of the visit will be to celebrate the silver jubilee of Her Majesty’s accession to the throne and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be pleased to know that the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will be able to visit each State, even though their time in each will necessarily be limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although they in turn made smaller, 4- cylinder cars, they seemed to promote more their larger, 6-cylinder and 8-cylinder cars which were not overly popular with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the area of housing policy most <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have indicated that they have one thing in common- a firm aspiration to be home owners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This statement is based on an assessment of the physical problems of housing, involving, firstly, an investigation of the size and nature of the need, judged in terms of the aspirations of all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, after considering demographic factors, and then an assessment of the physical resources available to meet that need, such as materials, manpower, land, technology and organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be argued that we know too little about the means by which people finance their home purchases or the relationship between their incomes and the rents they pay, but we do know that the vast majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, given the opportunity and the encouragement, will aim to be home owners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One must comment, therefore, in this debate on the initiative which was undertaken by the FraserAnthony Government soon after December of last year to decrease interest rates by 1 per cent This decision, taken with the whole package announced by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, gives positive proof that we are concerned about the housing needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and that we totally oppose the philosophy of the Labor administration which said that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would have to get used to the idea of living in smaller homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If politicians themselves have no respect for the electoral law how can the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> respect their politicians? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were worried about the way in which the previous Prime Minister imposed a national anthem on the country without taking any real notice of the feeling of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Eighty-five per cent of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> live in urban communities, but always in the past, under Conservative Governments, the rural areas, the sectional group which the Minister represents, take the cake and give the crumbs to the city dwellers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can do without that kind of expertise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I use that expression advisedly because that is the expression with which the Press and the Liberals have been able to con the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into accepting that the 270 000 unemployed are all bludgers when there are no jobs available for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not know yet that many of them are going to lose $6 to $8 a week because of the Government’s decision to restrict this scheme to people who are buying their first house, and then for only the first 5 years of purchase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I give it due credit for the money it has spend but the question is now: How does this Government, without getting into partnership, propose to develop what it, in fact, owns and ought to be developing on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that the present Government has come closer than ever before to presenting a set of guidelines for overseas investment which are basically unemotional and which reflect the requirements and aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must ensure that the Trade Practices Act remains a true guardian of the interests of consumers and of genuine and healthy competition in the business community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not believe the interests of the Parliament and of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be best served by establishing an  ad hoc  expenditure committee, without taking into consideration how that committee will supplement and co-ordinate with the activities of all other committees of both houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the people of Australia will recognise and appreciate the hard work and dedication of those in this industry because there is not much reward for the dedication on the part of the many people who are committed to the view that they should try as hard as possible to bring a good quality product to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to assist Australian exports by providing a top quality beef product which will attract additional export income for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will have to bear part of the responsibility for the recent and imminent tragedy in East Timor, because a silent group of Foreign Affairs officials has skillfully sought to protect their own pet project of a certain kind of relationship with the Suharto Government of Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have had some difficulty in obtaining an understanding of the issues involved in the East Timor situation and in obtaining the facts about the tragic events that have occurred there, particularly since September of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their presence in what we now know to have been a very dangerous war zone can be explained by the possibility that they, like most of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, did not and could not know that such a ferocious war was taking place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> look at the industry from that angle, I believe that they might find that the contribution they are being called on to make, if that is the way to look at it, is fully justified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In deciding that  Waltzing Matilda  should be played for Australia at the Olympic Games at Montreal, did the Prime Minister take account of the findings of this the largest opinion poll ever conducted in Australia- it was 30 times as large as any polls ordinarily conducted in Australiaor did he consider that the personal wishes of himself and his colleagues should override the preference so recently and clearly expressed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever final decision the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> make, I am sure that it will be a decision that is intrinsically their own and something that will be remembered and be of value for a long while. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only serious criticism I want to make of the speech of the honourable member for Hawker is first of all to remind the House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that- it may not have been the fault of the honourable member for Hawker- the Whitlam Government made great play of its contribution to the reconstruction of Darwin, but the reconstruction of Darwin in terms of the Government’s responsibility has not proceeded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it does mean that the Prime Minister and the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony),  who is a member of the National Country Party, ought to do something to help Whitney Todd, at least the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would say: ‘For goodness’ sake, pay your debts in this respect’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said on Tuesday, there is no doubt in my mind that people in high places in the Foreign Affairs Department conspired to mislead the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that his reference to codifying the Constitution and making it clear to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be looked at by the Government and that it will not be possible for those pseudo great men, interpreters of the Constitution who wish to misrepresent the facts, to put the GovernorGeneral into a position where his situation is falsified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has not escaped the attention of thinking people in this country that the main reason for this savage attack on the Department of Urban and Regional Development is petty, high-handed revenge by the LiberalNational Country Party Government on concepts and efforts that were basically good for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me say for his information and for the information of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Government has resolved to maintain bulk billing, to the advantage particularly of pensioners and low income earners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This was further borne out by the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  in this House yesterday when he produced figures to show that allegations by  Mr Hawke,  who claimed that 57 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be worse off as a result of the total package, were completely wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> elect the present Federal Government for this? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at a referendum of May 1967 indicated overwhelmingly their view that this Australian Parliament has a special obligation to make laws for the advancement of the people of Aboriginal race; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That kind of situation can no longer be countenanced by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why it is a matter of high priority for my Government that not only must things like land rights be recognised; programs for bicultural understanding must also be implemented, reach a high level and pervade every section of the community from the children to the elderly, because only when the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> understand Aborigines, their traditions, their culture, their spiritual affinity with land, can they understand what is involved in the granting of land rights and why. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is this need for creating a situation where doctors have to be mindful of their fees and mindful of their costs, as patients also need to be mindful, and indeed the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have to be mindful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Liberal and National Country Parties were overwhelmingly endorsed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> last December we faced a set of economic circumstances which should never have occurred in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet that Government did little in those whole 3 years to counteract what was obviously the cancer in the body politic of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason we have emphasised on many occasions the fact that to help Australia to get out of the present malaise, it is essential that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> get into the market place, unlock their bank accounts and spend their money because by spending their money they will establish the cyclical effect which will ultimately result not only in increased investment in plant and equipment but also in increased employment- and that is the main objective of the exercise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The economic indicators show that consumer confidence is slowly returning to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Never before has any government within weeks of its election got down to the job of solving the problems of the Australian economy with such determination- problems not of our making but certainly ones which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> elected us to solve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Government made the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believe that governments could do everything. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has virtually reduced  Medibank to a shell, after promising the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it would not interfere with it in any way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Maribyrnong  (Dr Cass),  the honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  and the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden),  I believe have effectively pointed out the Government’s betrayal of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also believe that social welfare programs such as the Australian Assistance Plan must be pruned to realistic levels before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> lose their initiative and independence altogether and settle for a way of life based on handouts, as they were encouraged to do by our predecessors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe that it touches on the critically important residual economic problem now that the Government has dealt with so many other problems which face the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and Government today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a decision of the highest level of authority, of the highest level of common sense, and designed to be in the best interests of the unions and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> still did not learn properly last year is that the support scheme is not a scheme that encourages the Government to put in a great deal of money and leave it there; it is a scheme whereby the Government lends money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is ironic that the Government which now sits on the Treasury benches was elected to government because it told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and in particular the 5 250 000 employees in the work force: ‘If you vote for us we will hand control of the unions back to the members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will respond positively to the speech of the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Since this Government took office- since the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> put us into office convincingly- the Government has been extremely active in continuing its effort to try to get greater access for primary products to the European Economic Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s intelligence agency and the Minister’s own Department know the truth- and I stress that,  Mr Minister-  yet this House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> continue to get evasions from the Government and lies from the Indonesian generals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opposition speakers who have spoken today about increased deaths on the road as a result of this Bill, in my view, stand condemned in the eyes of this Parliament and in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, given the opportunity, have welcomed Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The private doctors in this country will want to retain somewhere between 50 per cent and 60 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as private patients. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides the widest choices available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is no good the Labor Party trying to say that we are taxing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given time he might have come to the party with an ingenious scheme such as we offer the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> today, providing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with the widest possible choice, imposing a system that directs most of the subsidy to the disadvantaged and calling upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the higher income levels to pay a greater proportion of their health costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime I look forward to discussing the matter with my counterpart State Ministers and I am sure that we will be able to report in the Budget session a far more practical and sensible agreement which is based upon proper legal terms in respect of the modified Medibank proposals and which will provide health security to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will he table the report and ensure that copies are available to the many interested <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> anxious to see it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-52-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On occasions, Australians, whether they are exporters or consumers, will have to pay for having industries which the great majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want and which it is in the national interest for us to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within 6 months of taking office this Government has welshed on the firm and unequivocal commitments it made to the Aboriginal people and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally about Aboriginal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In passing, let me mention that that matter in itself demonstrated the very great indifference which the Liberal and National Country Parties displayed at that time to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally and to needy people in particular, since the failure to grant Supply caused disruption to many Aboriginal programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That will have a marked impact on the attitudes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to Aboriginal advancement as well as entrenching government activity, acknowledgement and recognition of the special interests of Aboriginals in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am somewhat critical of the non-attempts that have been made to persuade the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the census is a desirable instrument or gathering information for Government policy making purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that an analysis of those speeches of members of the Opposition will make known to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the undeniable fact that the Opposition is pledged not to allow Australian families and their children to own their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We completely reject that as a proposition, but it is interesting to note the change in attitude of the Labor Party now that it realises that one of the reasons it was beaten on 13 December was the fact that it did not give enough emphasis and encouragement to <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to own their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No wonder the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> now believe that Australia is once again a land of opportunity in which we can all plan ahead with confidence and with optimism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the serious consequences of the manner in which the Labor Party when in office downgraded matters of defence was the reaction of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is encouraging to note that informed sources, informed observers, now claim that all this has changed, and not since the Vietnam war has there been a greater defence awareness amongst our <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amount of interest by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the Cadet Corps was clearly in evidence when more than 1000 letters and submissions containing constructive suggestions were received by the Millar Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Government led the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to believe- and it did them a great disservice in so doing- that there was no foreseeable threat for 15 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> might as well start to realise the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only when the decisions have been made, and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have had clearly explained to them their role that we can expect to receive the full co-operation of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does the  Telecommunications Act  1975 provide that the Australian Telecommunications Commission shall perform its functions in such a manner as will best meet the social, industrial and commercial needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for telecommunications services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-54-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is strict adherence to the principle compatible with the Commission’s duty, as outlined in Section 6 ( 1) of the  Telecommunications Act  1975, to perform its functions in such a manner as will best serve the social, industrial and commercial needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for telecommunications services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-54-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can count themselves immensely fortunate to have had him as a servant over such a long period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760817_reps_30_hor100/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does it suggest that the sacrifices by a very wide section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be in vain? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was not a word about the Government’s stated intention of driving SO per cent or 60 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> out of Medibank and into the private funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it has any concern for the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, it will admit its mistakes and think again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We took that action because 70 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had already taken out extra insurance above standard Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must know that only 20 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- mostly those on the higher incomes- seek that form of insurance; 80 per cent of the people covered by private funds are insured at intermediate ward level of hospital cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, we recognise that 70 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are already privately insured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a very poor political debating point for the Leader of the Opposition to try to hoodwink the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by saying: ‘Now you have to pay for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the good sense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will regard that as a most absurd proposition and will reject it immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was contrary to the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, 70 per cent of whom maintained private health insurance and showed their confidence in the private health funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has the overwhelming support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and, from my own experience, I know it also has very considerable support in the rank and file of the trade union movement itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not an attitude which will commend itself to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who are looking for a lead which we have provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the ballot box has proved to be a futility, as it did late in 1975, and when a political party seizes power by violating conventions and by lies and misrepresentation, and when it arrogantly and blatantly breaks its elections promises, which is what the Liberal and Country parties did in respect of Medibank, the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, particularly the working class people in Australia, have every right to use the methods of passive resistance to manifest their anger and indignation at what has been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-25-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps in many ways we are looking for quite a remarkable person, but nevertheless the people of Australia and this Parliament have every expectation that we shall find somebody who has these very rare qualities and who will be able to serve this Parliament and through it the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have now seen the first Budget of the men who rejected the last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ostensible justification for all this muddle, this manifest self-contradiction, all this insensitivity, all these burdens on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- the justification of this Government’s whole economic strategy- is confined to a single word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is how it responds to the clearly expressed wish of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in 1967 that this Parliament should have responsibility for the welfare of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that until 1967 the Constitution prevented this Parliament making laws or appropriations for people of the Aboriginal race in the States, but by an overwhelming majority in 1967 the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> determined that this should be a Federal responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this is done in order to abdicate responsibilities specifically conferred on the Federal Government by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take the opportunity of congratulating him on giving the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the first real chance in 3 years to see economic stability return to our great nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fortunately the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and free enterprise got a reprieve from the insanity of the former Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have already seen the disastrous effects of trying to spend our way out of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I did not think the Opposition would have the audacity and the cheek to come before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and condemn itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Budget would have to go down in history as the greatest fraud perpetrated on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by this fraudulent Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He made no attempt to set a strategy for sound economic financial management that will benefit the great majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Almost every  speaker  on the Government side has repeated the proposition that this is a tremendous benefit for all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We always will remember that approach which was taken by the conservative forces to throw fear into the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This first Lynch Budget, or Fraser Budget as it might be called, is a genuine and sincere effort on behalf of this Government to roll back a very heavy stone which the Labor Government rolled on top of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, Australian private enterprise- business, large and small- and primary and secondary industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Labor Government was going to thrust its scheme upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and Australia would have had to find the money to fund it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No Budget of the Federal Government, including the Budget now before the House, can be successful unless it has the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> remain indifferent and ill-informed of what is happening at home and abroad, the time will surely come when our life and our country will be taken from us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us be Australians first and let us have a national union of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us all lift our standards higher and let us aim higher in harmony together as <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that this is true insofar as the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is misleading most of all because,  9Vi  months after the Liberal and National Country Parties took over the government of the country, it seeks to persuade the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the sorts of problems that we have in this country are not world problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He could not get away with the sort of speech, misleading the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that we have heard from the Prime Minister tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, not only were the people at the last Federal election misled into believing that the people who are now in control would manage our economy better, but in speeches such as the one to which we have just had the misfortune to listen to in this House tonight, they are still seeking to mislead the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the same way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the only country in the world, that I know of, that has larger unemployment now than 9 months ago; yet still, 9 months after they took over, the Prime Minister of this country rises in this House in a Budget debate and seeks to persuade the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to mislead the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into believing that the Government’s strategy is working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Budget is either going to reduce the services to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that are normally given by the States or it is going to force the States to increase their charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is another example of a deception perpetrated on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Payments to State and local governments, after repayments of loans have been deducted, amount to $9,077m, which is a net increase of 7 per cent The Treasurer’s claim about a higher percentage is based on his treating previous unemployment relief schemes, for which the honourable member for Reid  (Mr Uren)  and the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  were principally responsible- I refer to unemployment relief schemes such as the Regional Employment Development scheme which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have applauded so much- as if they did not exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> voted approximately 9 to 1 in favour of uplifting the conditions of Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were trying to get justice for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, to ensure that they got a proper equity out of God-given assets like bauxite, coal and iron ore.

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have now seen the first Budget of the men who rejected the last . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will probably not be until 12 months of operation is completed that Medibank Private will be able to determine the most economic package that it can offer to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the other funds have, of course, offered more at a lower price for the higher tables but 80 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who privately insure will insure for shared room accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> listening to this debate to think hard on that group of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is first and foremost to put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- I have in mind in particular the rank and file of Australian unions, if not their leaders- this fundamental truth: It is the big wage rise of the employed man that costs the unemployed man his job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We put this to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It had an enormous amount of trust placed in it, but it is using its policies as breeding grounds for the division of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 shall quote a few things from it which prove that the Prime Minister was misleading the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Whitiam Government set about its business bashing operations in 1973, it laid the foundations for much of the mess the present Government has to try to correct and which it will correct with the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To continue to say, as the Prime Minister did, that no aspect of the Budget demonstrates the Government’s concern for people more than the attack on inflation is to delude the supporters of the Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also recognised the national government’s responsibilities on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to support the disadvantaged within our society, the aged, infirm, the women, Aborigines, the poor and the dispossessed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The doctrinaire policies espoused by the  Deputy  Prime Minister are causing calamity and crisis that can only increase and which are already reaching proportions which will cause very great suffering among the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, this debate is about this year’s Budget and this year’s Budget clearly deserves to be rejected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The central purpose of this Budget is to combat the high rate of inflation and to restore full employment and economic activity, and that in itself is the greatest social benefit this Government can, and will, confer on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I would like to do in the time left to me in this debate is to try to convey to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> just what this obscure phrase ‘the indexing of taxes’ means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend these massive, novel, farreaching initiatives to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it seems to me that to interfere with the creative talents of a lot of Australians is a step in the wrong direction and perhaps a suppression of the creative ability of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer was at great pains in his second reading speech to say that a 5 per cent increase in the 1976-77 State Government Loan Council program was being unfairly criticised by many States and many <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This statement is particularly clarified when we recall the infamous Arab loan dealings- conduct which lead to a great act of courage and statesmanship from a great Australian, the Governor-General,  Sir John  Kerr, who acted completely correctly in fact and in law in allowing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to be the arbiters in the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us be clear that Medibank Private is competing very effectively with the private health insurance funds in the table which will be taken by 80 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who insure themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To ensure that there will be fair competition the Government decided that all charges that the private health insurance funds have to meet in the States would be the subject of a notional deduction from Medibank Private and this would be reflected in the premiums that the funds could offer the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been honest enough to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that until such time as we control our rate of inflation long term economic stability and prosperity will not arrive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been honest enough to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that there is a critical nexus between unemployment and inflation, and that there is a critical nexus between the unwillingness of people in Australia to invest and the high rate of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been honest enough to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that until such time as a responsible wages policy is developed in Australia we cannot have the economic recovery that we all so devoutly want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We promised above all at the end of last year that we would create an Australia in which individuals once again played a leading role, that we would create an Australia in which private enterprise held pride of place, and that we would create an Australia in which the individual efforts and initiatives of ordinary <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be the device by which economic recovery could be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been a reforming government, a government which has kept its promises and a government which I believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will continue to trust in the measure that they demonstrated in December last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the first time for such a long time that I have sat in this place and not heard taxes put on to the beer, for example, of the working man, the wine for South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, various liquors, cigarettes, motor cars, and other goods, and I do think that one ought to congratulate the Treasurer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not opposed to measures to bring down the inflation rate, but we feel that matters of human concern to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should also be receiving consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the overwhelming vote of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the electoral massacre of the Labor Party, the Leader of the Opposition has displayed unparalleled effrontery, stubbornness and incredible arrogance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australian participation in return for extended leases so that the Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would always be in increasing participation in income and management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If in response the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> could accept productivity as their goal and if they could adopt a different approach to self-help as an alternative to Government handouts, we would be on the way back to recovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Labor Government was thrown out of office by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> last December the number of unemployed had risen to 328 000, which is close to 5 per cent of the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time in 3 years the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been able to see that they have a government in Canberra that is accepting responsibility and that possesses the competence and the expertise to restore the nation to prosperity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I share the concern of the Government and of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that we continue to have a large number of people unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I propose that it should be designed merely to communicate to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the fact that this Government has a coherent economic strategy which can and will work, but only if it has the active support of all members of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We, as a Parliament, must get the message across to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to get behind the Government and ensure that this plan works for the benefit of the whole community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have publicly expressed on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> my sympathy for their loss, and was first to sign the book of condolence in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-In no area more than Aboriginal affairs has this Government demonstrated to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the sheer hypocrisy of its election promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government’s shameful exploitation of Aboriginal unemployment and housing initiatives, its callous indifference to Aboriginal legal aid, nutrition programs and aid to Aboriginal health centres is an affront to the integrity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was hoist by its own petard; it was caught in its own web in misleading the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about the importance of deficits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were misled by the Liberal-Country Party coalition prior to the election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, none of what was said then has come true, and I think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> now realise that rape of democracy which took place last November in the name of economic sanity was a furphy and that all they are getting out of it is growing unemployment and a level of inflation which is higher than they could have expected under a Labor administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will cop their lies continually, they are quite foolish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is a cavalcade of broken promises by a dishonourable government that cannot realise that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can trust nobody if they cannot trust the Government of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rationale is to force the work force into submission, to impose through the fear of mass unemployment and the terror of poverty, a reduction in real incomes and in the standard of living of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Budget may well be fair representation of Fraser ‘s philosophy but it is not the philosophy of the Australian Labor Party, nor in the long run will the philosophy appeal to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to expect a Budget which enshrines the principles of economic security, education opportunities, equality through social welfare, security of employment, and wage and income levels commensurate with skill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not accept a budget which deliberately reduces the effectiveness of the Prices Justification Tribunal and the Trade Practices Commission- the 2 bodies doing the most to protect consumers against inflationary price rises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not accept a budget which deliberately sets out to attack the level of their real income, and offers nothing but higher prices, higher interest rates, greater unemployment and recession in its place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How often has the reality of our programs when announced been met with silence and stony stares as Opposition members realised their efforts to mislead the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can only undermine their own credibility in the electorate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Cop this one- Jack Mundey, the communist, the one who is the friend of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the one who stands for democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The time has come for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to make a stand on behalf of democracy and to tell the rabble rousers on the Opposition benches that they do not want any more of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is time that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> spoke up and said: ‘We do believe in democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any honourable member who would lend his name in support of this function on 20 September, who would lend his support to the publication of this document or who says that the $3,600 worth of damage that has been caused to Commonwealth vehicles is justified stands condemned in this House and stands condemned in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I am here to do is to remind members of the Opposition that as their pre-selection is determined by unions in most cases, they have some responsibility to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and that is all that the Governor of South Australia meant to convey by his remarks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am quite certain that the great majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> hope to be given an opportunity to entertain and to make at home sailors of the American fleet who will be in many Australian ports after that exercise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have shown in unmistakable terms that they do not want this to happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government should not be allowed to snow the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into believing that this will overcome all the massive problems associated with the 400 000 unemployed in Australia today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What we have tried to do is to minimise the impact of chronic illness on the level of premiums that 70 per cent; of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will have to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the honourable member want 70 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to be paying more premiums? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope he understands that the concept involves justice for 70 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who seek private insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both the ALP and the ACTU proposal ignore the fact that 70 per cent of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are now covered for hospital benefits and choice of doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody could claim that it would be just or fair for this 70 per cent of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- as envisaged under the ACTU proposal- to have to pay a higher rate of income tax to help meet health costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was certainly expressed to us by the trade union movement which felt that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, or a percentage of them, who wished to stay with Medibank should have that right to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that we should conclude this debate, take whatever procedural steps are necessary to have the motion put and then proceed to deal with the Appropriation Bills, and in due and proper time we can conclude the debate on the residue of the Government’s program relating to health insurance which we intend to have passed by this House so that it can go to the Senate and be implemented for the advantage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on 1 October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Budget and its effect on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would only be rivalled by the horror Budget of the early 1950s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, one of the Government’s main hopesfrustrated as they have been- for economic recovery is that somehow the bulk of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will accept lower wages yet spend more- spend themselves out of an economic depression and receive less money for their daily stint of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole saga of events that have taken place since the proposal was originally put forward have served to confuse, to abuse, to violate the interests of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in respect of health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why should we not have a plural system and give an abundance of opportunities to <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> if they want them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Opposition refused to let Parliament operate sensibly and in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He needs a couple of years but in the meantime he needs to have this measure passed by the Parliament in the interests of the medical care of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He seems to take the attitude that whereas <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally accept the proposition that many things that are important to individuals and to the nation at large should be financed on a capacity to pay principle- I am referring to such matters as social welfare benefits, child endowment, widow pensions, age pensions, even the defence of the country and many others that come under the administration of State governmentswhen it comes to health we ought to depart from that principle and revert to a philosophy whereby people have to look after themselves and whereby a levy ought to be paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that in respect of many important services that sustain the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> individually and in a corporate way we acknowledge the principle that people should pay according to their capacity to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was shattered, we all know, by the vote of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on 13 December last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I rise with pleasure tonight to support the Budget introduced by the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  and to reject completely the amendment moved by the Opposition, an amendment which, in the light of the performance of the Whitlam Government while in office, can be described in no other way than as hypocritical and designed to hoodwink the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even in the 8 months that have elapsed since the change of government there has been a significant reorientation of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> away from the public sector and towards confidence in the private sector, but there are still the uncertainties that, of course, are the reasons for our introducing a number of continued stimuli in those sectors in which they are needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It did it in such a fashion that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are thoroughly confused as to what the situation is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> made up their minds on this question on 13 December last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been conned in the last decade or so by the Australian Labor Party and by ALP-leaning academics, one of whom I understand is to be the next member for Bonython. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer the Minister to a statement he made in the House yesterday that he would bring to the attention of the Australian Broadcasting Commission the desire of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to view the forthcoming debates between  President  Ford and  Mr Carter  in the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be a long haul, and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> realise that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to stress to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the key factor in getting this result has been the moderation achieved in the wages-prices merrygoround, the futile process of wages up and then prices up, prices up and then wages up, in a futile attempt to get ahead, and in the process weakening the economy and creating- or, as things are now, maintaining- the high and totally unacceptable level of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> support the Government in its view of the futility of pushing for big wage and salary increases which result only in higher prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, along with a former Treasurer in this place, perceive this truth that the big wage increases for people in employment are what cost the unemployed jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Government and the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can see, but not the Opposition and some union leaders, as distinct from rank and file unionists, is that we need a breathing space, a brake to the futile wage- price spiral in order to set the stage for renewed growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take it that we regard it as a desirable objective because it is the only means by which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can increase their purchasing power, their standard of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it did not indulge itself in the mad chase to cut Federal spending then much more of the 1975-76 Budget allocations would now be serving the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe it is absolutely essential in Estimates debates dealing with social security, repatriation and health to indicate to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that this Government is a government of concern for the elderly and the unfortunates in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That situation was brought about by the Hayden Budget which was introduced last year, in which concessions which were previously granted were taken away from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We realise our responsibility to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and we accept the challenge of that responsibility we have to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think I need dwell on that because most of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> understand the problem, even if the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant)  does not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1975, that year in which the moneychangers and accountants- the men with a passion for interest rates seemingly as dionysiacal as the passion of some men for ‘other things ‘-were to have their terrible day of triumph, a man dressed in the clothes of a bygone age, dismissed one of the greatest prime ministers this country has ever had, and then had the colossal effrontery later to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that history would vindicate his action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the fault of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, if he likes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what has been recognised in the United Kingdom and what I believe is recognised by the great majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is simply this: There is a nexus between wage increases and company profitability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that they are day by day winning greater support and recognition by a larger number of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, I believe, to the eternal shame of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that so little has been done for our Aboriginal population over the past 200 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable gentlemen opposite have stressed again and again the sound instinct of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as shown in referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Griffith in concluding his speech referred to a gallup poll indicating what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> was that this national Parliament was responsible for the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I believe that the reason for the emphatic decision of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> was the plain view that Aborigines are entitled to a new basis of treatment, and that new basis of treatment is compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that one other reason why the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> gave this Federal Parliament power to deal with Aborigines was that they believed that at the national level there could really be a scientific attack on Aboriginal needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recent public opinion polls continue to support that decision by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and endorse the high regard in which he is held by the overwhelming majority of all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can he assure the Parliament that no attempts will be made to terminate the service provided by Telecom in receiving and conveying messages from East Timor to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally, in line with the wishes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, administration has been tightened up, with lower allowances for such items as travel, consultants fees, advertising and the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, those who practise and preach the principle of free enterprise then have to say that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should forgo the $2 a barrel on all new discoveries of oil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why do we hand back to them in the form of a royalty money that rightly belongs to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I cannot understand why those people who sit on the Government benches now want to turn over to private individuals the development of the natural resources of this country which are not the property of those private individuals; they are, in fact, the property of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who are denied the opportunity of ownership of any of them because these people claim ownership of those resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have listened to tedious debates in this House arguing over a couple of hunder thousand dollars, yet right underneath our nose the major interests and the major assets of Australia are being filched from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It relates to the employment of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in industry, a matter which was debated earlier today and one which must be in the minds of every honourable member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is one area that has not been mentioned this evening that is of great concern to me and, I am sure, to honourable members on both sides of the chamber and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- that is, drug abuse, particularly drug abuse pertaining to the young. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that my remarks will bring some truth at last to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should have a good range of dairy products, including cheese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister is wedded to concepts of federalism that pre-date Federation, that will entrench State bureaucracies, that will strengthen the domination of local government by State bureaucracies to the detriment of true regionalism and the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw what happened under the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition when he had one  of the  most dynamic ministeries in Australia, one that helped fulfil the aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> which had been held back for so long- for 23 years of Liberal-National Country Party misrule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed the Leader of the Opposition is the greatest convicted centralist in Australia, having been convicted by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on 13 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A poll has shown that 90 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> favour government support for the performing arts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we have only the record of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to go on, the hopes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for government assistance in this important area are certain to be dashed; only their worst fears can be fulfilled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to know which of the many policies on record can be restated and which cannot be restated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister is treating foreign policy as a joke and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with contempt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let the Prime Minister at least explain candidly and clearly to this Parliament and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> exactly what he has done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government throughout 1976 has been negligent in its responsibilities to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in not pursuing the full facts surrounding the tragic deaths of these 5 Australian journalists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again the Prime Minister has let down the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in his unprincipled fumble towards appeasement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The so-called 4-point policy of this Government was not repeated in the Indonesian Parliament nor in the communique; rather the Indonesian and <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were told that we must now Mook to the future ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can he really believe that the putting of the East Timorese case for self determination before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is a disruption unless he has in fact recognised the illegal incorporation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite critical that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> recognise this motion for what it is- yet another positive demonstration that the radical left has total control of the parliamentary and extra-parliamentary Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I really think that the Leader of the Opposition believes that at no stage should an Australian Government, an Australian Parliament or the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, take its own policy decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that we recognise that in the whole of the substance of the allegation which is now before us in the Parliament, what is happening is that the Labor Party is contrasting its continued and progressive subservience to the Left- to the communist influence within the trade union movement- rather than presenting a policy on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place I think that the National Country Party of Australia and the Liberal Party of Australia have a vested interest in trying to divide the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have made up their minds and made their choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to bring to the attention of the House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the tragic plight of many refugees from the unhappy state of Lebanon and the Fraser Government’s shoddy record in relation to these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that they will mean significant improvements in social welfare and social security protection for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would believe that common sense would not dictate that a national strike at our ports would be the logical approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are feeling uncertain and timid about the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this slashing of spending, all this talk of belt tightening, the talk of no soft options and the failure to give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the feeling that the Government wants to reduce unemployment, that it is dinkum about it, have led to the timidity and the uncertainty which is found in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  Budget has merely been a continuation of the wrong policies inflicted on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> since the Fraser Government took over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me take this opportunity to stress to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the recent change in the interest rate on Australian savings bonds from 9.2 per cent to 9.5 per cent was not a general increase in interest rates but an adjustment of that rate back to the situation which prevailed before the period of monetary tightness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the vast majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> recognise the futility of that process of wages chasing prices and support us in our endeavour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An indication of the confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in Telecom Australia can be gained by looking at the results of the recent loan and how quickly that loan was taken up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am rapidly coming to the conclusion that we should be putting to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a brand new Constitution- a complete alternative- rather than trying to go through the difficulties of amending words in a section and deleting other sections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think it would be very important to suggestand I will be urging this on my own Party- that we do submit to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> an alternative Constitution which would clearly show that the House of Representatives is the paramount House of the people in respect of money bills, that there is room for a Senate and that if there were difficulty between the 2 Houses in other than Supply there would immediately be a joint sitting and there matters could be resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to see a set of circumstances under which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> could vote  de novo  on what the Constitution should be like on the basis that when they elect a House of Representatives it ought to be able to govern, and on the basis that a Senate has certain duties and if there is a conflict other than on money Bills it can be resolved without a double dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this: Despite the claims by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  when he was Prime Minister last year about rage and, in effect, backed up by his  Deputy  with talk about going back to the streets, as he said earlier this year, and claims about chaos and anarchy, the good sense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> saw us through that phase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The good sense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would see us through similar, if regrettable, circumstances should they recur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has dawned upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that that would be totally at variance with out attitude to the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the last election the Government Parties included in their election policy issued to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the following statement: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was just a red herring drawn across the path of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in a bid for votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, one point I should stress, and it is my responsibility to bring it before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, is the tremendous importance of having a defence capability and I should explain what that capability stands for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite have given away that line because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> found it unacceptable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must concern ourselves with this sort of internal problem as well as with the overall problem of looking at the cost of replacing equipment and at the issue, with which the Department of Defence must wrestle year after year, of providing in Australia the maximum degree of return for the investment that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> through their Government will make in purchasing defence equipment for the armed forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I would like to see an improvement in the morale of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- the young people and the old people- to defend and keep Australia safe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is hard for many people to see the actions and statements by staff that we have read of recently as being compatible with the ABC’s responsibility to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> or compatible with conduct consistent with engagement in employment in a high calling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, support of the Commission by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is their way of exercising their influence and ensuring that the ABC reflects their wants, including impartiality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is making special efforts and very creditable efforts to have our inflation rate reduced in the interests of all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I am now talking about the area which covers 85 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course one can always advance the proposition that not enough money is being made available by the Federal Government for the essential demands of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has a great concern to improve the housing conditions of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> which, incidentally, already are pretty high by world standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has happened is that the Minister and his Government have realised that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> no longer want the bland rhetoric of the McMahon and Gorton governments; they want action to relieve their chronic transport problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my Press statement following the Budget I said that whilst the present levy was indiscriminate and unfair in operating across the board on all coal company profits, the industry was healthy enough to sustain a selective tax to increase the return to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, that the industry can afford to contribute more than it pays in simple company tax to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This ignorant call by the National Party President in Queensland reminds me of the deception of this Government in seeking to persuade the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it is reducing taxes when, as we all know, it is inflicting additional taxes by imposing a health tax from the beginning of this month in the form of the Medibank levy or large subscriptions to medical and hospital benefit funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite obviously, if those who hope to improve and update the Constitution are to have their hopes endorsed and come into practice it is necessary to put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> measures that have the support of the Opposition, the Government and, probably of necessity, at least a majority of the States, as otherwise the measures are likely to fall to the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is necessary to commence my remarks on this Bill by correcting another of the great untruths which this Government is attempting to sell to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that local government has a vital role to play in partnership with State and Federal governments in the provision of services to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Since we started the debate on the shipbuilding industry some months ago, and in the last fortnight, a poll of Australians has shown overwhelmingly that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would vote to keep the industry in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> now know that it is possible for a Federal government to make agreements with State and local governments to provide such programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the real wonder is that it took so long for the true realisation of this course to become thoroughly apparent to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, this will force the States to introduce State income tax and place a burden of double taxation on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was good enough for Papua New Guinea to take the money of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the form of airports and the navigation facilities that were provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this logic will certainly commend itself to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A year ago the Liberal and National Country Parties were telling the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that they could run the economy better than the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What false promises were made then that misled the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> just a year ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is this decision of the Australian Government yet another example of its mixed up priorities and lack of interest in the health of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are licensing and regulation, which play such an important part in shaping the system to meet the basic interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are the Western <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to be denigrated for thinking of seceding because they felt that they were not getting all that they thought they should? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The environmental aspects of decisions having the effect of permitting the mining of all or any of these Teases will involve major permanent and irreversible environmental harm to the landscape, vegetation and lakes of the island and, consequently, substantially damage its value to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will there be wide discussion and debate by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The point I want to make is this: The Senate that refused to consider Supply was not the Senate that was elected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parties of honourable members opposite conspired to rig the Senate by stacking it with people who could not get elected and who could not get the votes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and utilised the votes of those people who were dishonestly appointed by State governmentshonourable members opposite do not know much about honesty- in order to acquire the numbers to defeat an elected government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will continue until we return to honesty and decency in government; until the rules of our democratic system are restored and upheld; until the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> reelect a government that stands once again for progress, humanity and justice, a Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the sort of program for which I believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> elected the Government that we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he can condone such actions and be party to them, he will live to regret them because he will bring upon himself the wrath of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> either now or sometime in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact, which is readily available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, is that the company involved releases an annual report which is made public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This ordinance destroys all the aims of the Australian Legal Aid Office, a body which was accepted by 94 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I shall briefly refer to the statement and then trace the relevance of a national water policy to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is so, why not let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> read the submissions and the report which was based on them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> decide whether the changes made to the Bill introduced last year by the Whitlam Government are acceptable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition proposes to move in the Committee stage a number of amendments to reinstate the Australian Government’s jurisdiction over these matters, as  Mr Justice  Woodward recommended and as the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> decided in the 1967 referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the introduction of legislaton which requires sympathy and understanding for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> I do not believe that those are the kinds of words and sentiments that ought to be used against members of Parliament from the precise Territory in which the legislation is going to find effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> voted overwhelmingly to allow the Federal Parliament to legislate for our Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps 90 per cent or 95 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> come into contact with Aborigines in Redfern or Moree or perhaps as tourists in Alice Springs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not have to argue whether it would be better or not; I merely say that on democratic grounds in May 1967 in the one referendum in the whole history of this country which one could say was really carried, because it was carried in every polling place, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> expressed the opinion that the national Parliament was the proper Parliament to handle Aboriginal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that that is a mistake and I believe that it is against the articulated opinion of the Aboriginal people and against the articulated opinion of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask him to respect the forms of the Parliament and the rights of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to know what this Government is doing and why it is doing it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The acceptance of people from refugee or quasirefugee situations is governed by principles of humanity, equity and compassion and by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s economic, social and cultural capacity to successfully accept and integrate such migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-61-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The vacuum at the heart of the Fraser-Lynch strategy, the panic and desperation evident in their latest decision, is a matter of the gravest concern for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, for employers, for trade unions, for consumers, for the business community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-23-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What confidence can the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the business community have in a government which lives by ad hoc and random decisions, which vents its hostility against anyone who questions its motives or its wisdom? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-23-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The denials were not just the accepted counter to speculation, but an affirmation to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the rest of the world of a staunch and entrenched policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-23-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To meet the cost of the Government’s capitulation the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> face even harsher monetary measures next year to stem the inflationary tide this Government is inviting- tighter credit, higher interest rates, dearer money- all the paraphernalia of a credit squeeze with its inevitable check on business confidence and expansion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-23-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have had enough of a Government which favours wealthy minorities, trades off one section of the community against others and makes the vast majority of Australians pay for the windfalls and favoured treatment it gives to the few. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-23-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a lesson the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will take to heart when next they choose the party to form a Government in this House and in the Australian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-23-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a similar vein of arrogance, about which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a right to know, the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  often walks out of this chamber when the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  is speaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-23-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not be denied the opportunity today of hearing more in this Parliament about the disastrous economic performance of the men who, in their own estimation, were born to rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-23-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever there is an opportunity for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to cast a vote they will have to look only at the present Leader of the Opposition to know where they will cast their vote on a ballot paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-23-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What is needed here is an opportunity to test the great common sense of the overwhelming majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-23-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in taking these stands we have the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and of the great bulk of rank and file trade unionists, We would be shown to have the support of rank and file trade unionists if they were only given the opportunity freely to express their views and not have their decisions pre-empted as their decisions were preempted by the Premier of New South Wales and the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions in respect of shipbuilding a few days ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-23-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I pay tribute in this House to the painstaking work of  Mr Justice  Fox and his fellow commissioners and congratulate them on the studious, temperate and, in its essence, profoundly humane report which they have given the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet this was how the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were acquainted with the report’s contents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In ignoring the true spirit of the report, in leaving the clear impression that the future of rnining was all that mattered, the Government has misled the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The longer the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have to consider the issue and the more it is talked about, the more concerned people become; the longer the Government delays, the more opposition it will face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government clearly recognises that the union bans are the only way mining and export can be held up until the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> examine the real issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are being denied any say in this important issue so that the Government can get MKU off the hook. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In turning its back upon the true spirit of the report the Government is misleading the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and setting Australia on a course that it may later regret. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will only penalise the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and Australia as a country if we do not utilise this immense wealth and our immense resources of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are becoming increasingly perturbed about some aspects of our education system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>About 70 per cent of the population continued to privately insure, indicating that this was a trend that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were anxious to preserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we need to do is to balance what has been occurring over the last three or four years in order that we can persuade a lot of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who are going overseas on their holidays not for the first time but perhaps for the fifth or sixth time that it may be worth while to have some interest in parts of Australia which are unique by international standards and which would be very worth while seeing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be able to do that to the satisfaction of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> only in so far as there is total equilibrium within the Australian community and total equilibrium within the economic community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government contemplates such a step it should have the guts to go to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government believes that it is going to lead the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> up the garden path by this deception then it has another think coming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What I fail to see is how a small group, and it is such a small group, can be encouraged by the Australian Labor Party to believe that it can use its power to destroy, to denigrate and to disrupt the daily activities of the majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and of its own trade union rank and file members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I submit that the thought behind the amendment is obviously indicative of the negative approach of honourable members opposite to matters which are of great personal interest and concern to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is worthy of recording that in 1946 the percentage of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> owning their own homes was 52 per cent, and this increased to 72 per cent in 1966. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that that Prime Minister never ever engaged in cheap politicking; rather all his statements and utterances were designed to improve the quality of life of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ABC is a most important part of the nation’s mass media, and the mass media play a most important part in the lives of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What strikes the ABC staff, ABC listeners and viewers and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as rather ludicrous is the Prime Minister’s assumption that he knows better than the ABC and its management how to run the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It explained the fears of many Government supporters and the growing fears of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about the Government’s intentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the great myths that the Government, aided and abetted by its media supporters, has attempted to sell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is that it is actually lowering the burden of taxation upon individual taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose I should admit that it is something that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have not as yet fully grasped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What has been the role of the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is to the effect that Australia can go it alone as a country without competent Federal authorities to fulfil the housing needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation is disastrous in that it takes away from the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> an instrument which could have been extremely effective in moderating housing activity around Australia, sustaining a degree of construction buoyancy and levelling out the funding of housing by way of assisting those people with the type of support they need to get into the home buying and home renting processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In more simple terms, this type of political cliche has tended to destroy any sense of patriotism in the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- a sense that historically has been very strong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the responsibility of this House and of the people in it is to give the message to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are today witnessing the end of three-quarters of a century of service to the House of Representatives, to the Parliament of Australia and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the Parkes- father and son. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A year ago the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were invited to get rid of the Labor Government- the Government that had created Medibank and health centres and legal aid, reformed education reformed our servile foreign policies, embarked on creative social programs and raised the living standards and expectations of all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sacrifices asked of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been made, and it must be said, made willingly; they have been made for nothing- in vain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In plain terms the living standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are lower today than they were when this Government took office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This fall in living standards- this slide in personal incomes and individual welfare and security- is so novel and dramatic a phenomenon that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have yet to grasp its implications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Prime Minister in his policy speech a year ago stated as a firm promise to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>: ‘Our policies will maintain the purchasing power of wages’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of our experience of this Government’s deception it would be obvious now that the phrase ‘in the current economic circumstances’ was a deliberate loophole; a year ago the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were entitled to take the promise at face value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Government has been misleading the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about the trend of real wages and the effect of its policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will note that every one of the Fraser Government’s attacks on real living standards- on actual money incomes- is the result of a broken promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A year ago the Liberals invited the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to turn on the lights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have been turned on to illuminate the Government’s incompetence, its dishonesty, its cynicism, its heartlessness; its favours for the wealthy and the privileged; its sustained attacks on the living standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; its  ad hoc  decisions; its economic disasters; its broken promises; its utter lack of grace and generosity; its mean and blinkered vision for this nation and its future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact he has misled this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and he has distorted the true position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Fraser Government the living standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are now on the path to sustained increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not be fooled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further let me stress to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what we have provided even in respect of Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I stress- and I think the common sense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> makes them understand only too well- that, as a direct consequence of this, unemployment shot up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lack of exploration for oil has set back the exploration program for years, so that the 70 per cent self-sufficiency in oil that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have enjoyed in recent years and which was so significant a factor in cushioning the impact of the world-wide increase in oil prices was endangered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to end on this note: Last December we won from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and we accept, the responsibility to put right the mess that the economy was then in, to create lasting economic recovery, and to restore growth and thrust and full employment in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As it does so, the real incomes and the living standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will grow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This year was the first year for many years that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have had lower standards of living forced upon them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The matter of public importance which is the subject of this debate is yet another in a series of attempts by the Opposition in recent weeks deliberately to undermine Australia’s economic recovery and to destroy the confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> which has been rebuilt during 1 976 following the near death-blow that it suffered during the Whitlam Government’s period of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this vote of support the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> made it crystal clear to the Labor Party that they wanted no further truck with a government that acted in a way in which the Whitlam Government acted during its disastrous period in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know this as we on this side of the House and I suspect the intellectually more honest members opposite do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have learned in one year that that was the greatest truth ever perpetrated on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-61-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am afraid that the only Christmas message that anybody objectively looking at the economy can give to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is that, after a year in which their standard of living has been reduced by the incompetent and inept economic policies of the people who rule us, we will have another year of similar wrong and inept policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-61-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of their lack of confidence the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not spend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-61-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw to the attention of the House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the alternative strategy put forward not only by myself and the Leader of the Opposition in the packages that he has prepared but also by the Premier of a major State, New South Wales, and also the Premier of Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-61-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe he had adequately conveyed to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the sacrifices that he has made in his portfolio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am paying tribute to the honourable, gallant and learned gentleman for the great economies he is making on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the administration of his portfolio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will he call for the tape of this episode and take the necessary action to stop such filth being broadcast to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-94-12">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why can the Treasurer not be as honest with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as with the Japanese Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#subdebate-13-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fraser Government has divided the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as never before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#subdebate-13-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a virtual confidence trick which they are trying to play once again on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#subdebate-13-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So by the time the Labor Administration was dismissed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, 328 000 people were out of work and the unemployment level had risen from 2.4 per cent to 5.6 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#subdebate-13-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a word, in urging the necessity for a limitation in the adjustment of wages and salaries to the increase in the consumer price index, we are not asking the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to accept that proposal in return for nothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#subdebate-13-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then he made a snide attack on the socalled privilege and position of the Prime Minister and tried to make out that the Prime Minister was implying to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that hardship is their sole lot and all to which they will be entitled in life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear this sick joke about the Prime Minister drinking champagne, yet when the Labor Government was dismissed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the Lodge was opened up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, it is appropriate that the Attorney should have given the House this opportunity to pay a tribute to a very able man, a very great servant of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and counsel to their representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has never shirked its responsibility to say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>: ‘You will not have economic recovery, a revival of manufacturing industry and thus re-employment of people and retention of people already employed unless you make your industries more competitive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no reflection on the ability and integrity of permanent public servants to say that these outside appointments have strengthened the Service as a whole and benefited the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it should be the view of all honourable members of the House that it is not an unreasonable expectation for people, both men and women, who have given a lifetime of service to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to the Public Service of the Commonwealth that the system be based on the principle that those officers who have worked their way through the second and third divisions of the Service over a period of years and so gained substantial knowledge should be given the opportunity of being selected as First Division officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts are that the Parliament is the executive instrument of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that the Ministers are the Parliament’s chosen officers, and that the departments, permanent heads and the whole instrument of administration are the arms of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this legislation goes right to the heart of parliamentary government and the Parliament as an executive instrument of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the money is available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members opposite fail to raise their voices against this obnoxious and savage increase in the directors’ salaries I claim that they are totally unfit and devoid of moral worth and unworthy of representing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in this national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the questions that are to be submitted to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> under this legislation there are 2 questions almost identical with questions that have already been submitted in earlier referenda and rejected, but they are not entirely identical and circumstances are different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> accept that there are legitimate occasions when they should be entitled to cast their views on suggested change, particularly change to the Constitution, which written as it is prescribes so much of the terms and conditions within which our Federal Government can operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When two of these matters were submitted last to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in 1974 they had not emerged as a result of the Constitutional Convention, although the Convention had its first meeting in Sydney on 3 September 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are two which I believe must be accepted by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> without controversy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that there has been a question submitted to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> before which included substantially the terms of this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the question of altering the Constitution so as to ensure that Senate elections are held at the same time as House of Representatives elections has been before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we cost those elections and if we think of the circumstances of the double dissolutions in 1974 and 1975, of the 7 separate national elections from 1963 to 1972 and the prospects for the next 20-year period, there is no doubt that there will be a very significant saving in terms of money to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit therefore that it is to the advantage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that it is to simplify the processes of electing members of the Federal Parliament and that therefore it is a question which should be supported unanimously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that each of these 4 questions should be submitted to the people and endorsed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Constitutional change is not something on which we should embark lightly, but when it has been ratified by successive Conventions and there has been an almost unanimous acceptance of those resolutions it is necessary that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have the chance to vote and endorse that decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party welcomes these Bills and fully supports the proposals that are to be put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by way of referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a nutshell it means that for some time we have been discussing how best to get the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to support change, but it appears now that the only practical way to do so is to have a Liberal-National Country Party <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that when this referendum is again put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> there will be a change of heart by that particular political group in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It only means again that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are still confused about what is happening to their governments and to their country when politicians and the political leaders cannot even agree on elementary democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not immune from the geriatric process of mental decay and accordingly it follows that there must be some intelligent appraisal by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of whether we think sixty, sixty-five or seventy should be the age at which the man or the lady- it could well be a lady on the High Court- should retire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High Court quite fairly has had to make interpretations but it is about time that we allowed the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> again to have a good look at where we are going as a nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the message we have to convey to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It clearly shows that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are bedevilled by frequent elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I applaud the  Government  for the fact that for the first time it recognises political parties as being representative of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will urge its adoption by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Bills should be passed and I hope that all the referendum proposals will in due course be passed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with the majority of voters in Australia and the majority of States supporting them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly and most importantly, this gives the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> an opportunity to pass a referendum which will have the effect of updating and contemporising the Australian Constitution consistent with the needs of Australia in 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that on this occasion the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will support the 4 proposals which we bring before them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are well and truly tired of repeated elections and the possibility of elections twice every 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposals which are now to come before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are remarkably, strikingly similar to those which exist under the Hare-Clark system which operates in Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least by virtue of the referendum proposals we are now bringing before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> they will know that if they elect a Liberal senator or a Labor senator at an election and that senator ceases to hold office for any purpose whatsoever during the ensuing period of his term of office, he will be replaced by a Liberal senator or a Labor senator as the case may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those reasons I believe that the measures before us will be accepted by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the proposition is a reasonable one which should have the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should carry all the referenda put forward on this occasion and I am sure that, given honest argument, on the merits of such argument they will do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an appalling sign of the economic mismanagement suffered by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> over the past year under this Liberal-National Country Party Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a pity that he has to distort and misrepresent the position that is explained in the clear words used in the legislation which is before us and to try to misrepresent to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the purpose of that legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the honourable member, and I ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, looking at the words- not read in total but looking at the specific operative words which are relevant in section 45D- to note that the action can be taken to deal with boycotts, to deal with a situation of employees who engage in conduct or in concert ‘for the purpose of hindering or preventing the supply of goods or services by the employer to a corporation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> endorsed this Government and its policy proposals because they did not want those boycotts; they did not want that sort of malicious conduct from people like the honourable member for Burke, who spoke before me in this debate and who made it clear that the unions want to be able to hold other people to ransom, that they want to be able to deal in a harsh and unconscionable way with other people’s property and the rights of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pledge myself to oppose any amendment to this sort of provision which, quite clearly, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have demanded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He wondered whether there was demand by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for an amendment - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall endeavour to carry this matter further and to cover some of the very important aspects of this legislation which will assist the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and will assist in the provision of jobs and creating certainty in manufacturing industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AH I can say is that the more they protest, the more people will wonder what they have to hide and the more the Government’s actions will be fully supported by the vast majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to the honourable member for Port Adelaide that he must have absolute contempt for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> if he really believes that the great majority of them accept the view that when the  President  of his Party takes off his Labor Party cap and puts on his Australian Council of Trade Unions President’s cap he becomes a different man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite will not get back on to the benches on this side of the Parliament until they earn the respect of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be a device to divert the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from the real troubles that they face with honourable members opposite as an economic management group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government was intent to say that some sections of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> could not engage in restrictive practices but the same sections wearing different hats certainly could. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This resulted in a great degree of involvement by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in a number of new industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then they will flow through to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a scheme for which the Labor Government twice sought to legislate while in office; it is based on an exhaustive inquiry commissioned by my Government; and it springs from a long-standing and specific undertaking by the Labor Partyto the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How long must the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> put up with this sort of efficiency? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the proposal by the Opposition in its Bill to have a redistribution every 3 years- under our Bill there will be a redistribution every 7 years- would have forced on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> unnecessary wasteful redistributions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inform the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the aims of imperialistic international and national movements, including communism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-When the Fraser Government was elected to office at the end of 1975 it was elected on the basis of various promises made to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, one of which was to support wage indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s rationale for pursuing this drastic and incredible policy of slashing the living standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is that first of all it wants to reduce inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an awareness by Government of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and Australian conditions, and a source of positive direction from which all Australians will  benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hoped that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will pass some referendums in May next, but they will allow only very minor adjustment to a greatly outmoded Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are failing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because we are not giving them the opportunity of stable government or government of a democratic institutional nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is perhaps a peculiarity of our Westminster system that governments and oppositions rarely agree about major national policy objectives, yet there has been a consensus for many years, among the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at least, that they expect from their governments near full employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Successive Liberal-National Country Party governments have believed, and rightly so, that the private sector which generates most of the goods and services used by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must be the source of major employment opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing more certain than that in the ultimate analysis the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> alone will be responsible for the safety and security of our land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s assessment of the problem is that ‘the prosperity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> depends on the strength of its productive private sector, on its manufacturing, mining and rural industries’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eight months later the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, in their most decisive vote in recent history, threw the Labor Government out of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I well remember that at that time all the members of the House of Representatives were united in their admiration of  Her  Majesty and  His  Royal Highness Prince Philip, of the charm and dignity which they brought to Australia and of the great impression that they made upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Navy, the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in a combined manner, which is most unusual, giving the people an opportunity to see those colours, to ponder what they mean and to understand that in the history of our nation those colours represent the honour of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In  Her  Majesty’s Speech, which was of course prepared for her by the Government, one of the most significant paragraphs contains a recognition of the private sector, as we know it, as being that sector from which comes the great prosperity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst one can understand that people will support a welfare program, I assure him that one of the reasons that his Government was elected in December 1972 was that it had been out of office for 23 years and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had forgotten what it would mean to have a profligate socialist government on the treasury benches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It took the Aus.tralian people 3 years to find out but when the opportunity came the reality is that in spite of all the criticisms made by honourable gentlemen opposite, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> voted them out of office in a manner almost without precedent in Australia’s political history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be obvious to all who can consider the facts of history that if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had wanted to retain their socialist government in December 1975; if they had wanted to keep the honourable member for Werriwa  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  as Prime Minister, there was a substantial and real opportunity for them to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people who speak eulogistically of the monarchy must have felt a real sense of embarrassment to see her in a situation like that where she was handed a piece of paper which demonstrated beyond any doubt that the Government has no legislative intentions- the honourable member for North Sydney who preceded me in the debate made this clear- to undertake any significant reform in respect of the needs of Australia and the well-being of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first mention by Her Majesty of the Government’s stand was in regard to the prosperity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> depending on the strength of our productive private sector, on the manufacturing, mining and rural industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If those 2-bob republicans who have suddenly come to light out of the woodwork think they will win the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by having a shot at  Her  Majesty the Queen they have another think coming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then the Speech goes on to waffle about the fundamental well being and freedom of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were looking to that Speech for any guide to the Government’s economic policy they were badly let down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The prosperity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> depends on the strength of its productive private sector, on its manufacturing, mining and rural industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be conscious of them and actively lobbying governments to reverse these actions because big business is equally as obnoxious as large government bureaucracies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the sort of thing we have come to expect from the Press, which orchestrates its publicity to fit in with a deliberate policy of the Government to take attention away from the unemployment problems and to mislead the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by deliberately using dishonest methods to undermine official statistics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only thing missing from these torrents of promises and platitudes is the slightest acknowledgment of responsibility or regret for the damage done to the Australian economy and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the destruction of great and creative programs, the continuing stagnation and decline and the falling living standards and diminishing opportunities which this Government is inflicting on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In plain terms we have a dishonest and discredited Government, a Government of lies and broken promises, a Government that is driving Australia into deeper recession and decline, a Government that is wilfully neglecting the urgent needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, a Government renouncing all responsibility for national welfare and national progress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Government is not only taking action to restore the economy, it is also making social reforms which are of fundamental importance to the freedom and well-being of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are very grave dangers for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the approach the Fraser Government has adopted in devolving its economic powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that eventually that will be understood by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the truth about that speech and the speech of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Uren),  who spoke about the straw which will break the camel’s back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My Government is not only taking action to restore the economy, it is also making social reforms which are of fundamental importance to the freedom and well-being of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The point is that we still have promises to fulfill which will give to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> many more advantages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I turn now to one other recent decision which the Government has made and which I feel will be of tremendous advantage to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am brave enough to stand up and tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about the advantages that they will receive from devaluation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I come now to the attitudes of some of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as to what they expect from the economy today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If honourable members opposite and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> look at the various components of the consumer price index they will see that we have arrested inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just what are the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> looking for? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is disgraceful for those poor people who want jobs, but when Australia is compared with West Germany, America and Canada which have booming industries it is found that those countries have a greater unemployment problem than Australia, This does not mean that we do not want to get industry moving or that we do not want to get jobs for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, but it is a fact of life that unemployment is unfortunately one of the parts of the modern everyday economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today the qualities of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the character of Australian society and the resources of the Australian continent hold out a great promise and a great challenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of Australia should be told that more often and loudly until they finally understand the way in which the Government is endeavouring to destroy all the things that were created for the betterment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> during the fortunate 3 years of Labor Government in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the heart of my Government’s policies lie a commitment and a concern; commitment to increasing the freedom, opportunity and equality of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; and concern with enhancing people’s ability to make their own choices and live their own lives in their own way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>opportunity and equality of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its only significant commentary was that the Government intends to press ahead with its industrial relations bureau which can serve only one purpose- to undermine the conciliation and arbitration system and to create disunity in the Australian community at a time when the most important thing that any government could seek to achieve in this community is unity of purpose among the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat my earlier statement that the Speech delivered by the Queen on behalf of the Government was a speech which did not offer this Par.liament or the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> much more hope than the speech that you,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  and I and some other honourable members in the chamber remember being delivered on an earlier occasion and which I think took - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, the GovernorGeneral, virtually after pleading again and again with this man who was allegedly his friend, was forced to take the only course open to him, to dissolve the Parliament and hand the matter over to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> face an historic decision on December 13. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the previous gentleman has just said would seem to me to negate a large part of the creativity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because it is expressed in his hostility to the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The prosperity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> depends on the strength of its productive private sector, on its manufacturing, rnining and rural industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the issue of Timor is quickly developing as the conscience of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in foreign affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would implant in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the idea that the philosophy of communism held by every country in the world that cares to declare itself a communist country involves the existence of one rigid system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My conscience dictates that I remind the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it was the tory Government which was in power recently that earmarked $80m of Australian taxpayers’ money to build the Cockburn Sound naval base. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> may forgive the Government for that for one, two or three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Today the qualities of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the character of Australian society and the resources of the Australian continent hold out a great promise and a great challenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The overwhelmingly friendly and enthusiastic welcome which the Queen received everywhere she went was an indication of what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> really think of the monarchy and our system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as surely as the Governor-General, on 11 November, stepped up the pace to bring about the break between Australia and the monarchy, so will it be the National Country Party and the Liberal Party which will bring about an end to the parliamentary system by trying to perpetuate this electoral fraud which they have thrust on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1974 the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were given an opportunity by this Parliament to establish certain basic democratic principles about the conduct of elections and about the definition of electorate boundaries in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their whole period in government indicated that they have a reckless and extravagant attitude with funds to the great detriment of the whole <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, not least of all to the detriment of the people they claim to represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Government is not only taking action to restore the economy, it is also making social reforms which are of fundamental importance to the freedom and well-being of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the dynamism of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the vigour of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are greater than is indicated by the statistics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do not believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are of that kind or of that order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the Minister would agree that these matters have to be handled in such a way as to permit complete communication between the Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about who comes here, who settles here and how they fit in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the Minister and the members of APIC for coming out and telling the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> quite bluntly that we can expect a considerable increase in immigration to Australiamuch larger than many other people would have believed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the heart of my Government’s policies lie a commitment and a concern: commitment to increasing the freedom, opportunity and equality of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; and concern with enhancing people’s ability to make their own choices and live their own lives in their own way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would have hoped that the speech supplied by her Government would have contained more substance and more optimism for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government stated in the Queen’s Speech that the prosperity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> depends inter alia on Australia’s mining industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will accept the fact that there were some difficulties in adjusting the administrative system to accommodate the modifications, but generally the scheme has settled down extremely well and we believe it is operating beneficially to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we were looking at a figure of $5,400m, exploding health costs, with no guarantee that the health of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> was getting any better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that 70 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> retained private health insurance was very much a deciding factor in our planning for modifications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly a significant percentage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> wanted the doctor of their choice in hospital, and the modifications that we made accommodated that obvious desire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that, in seeking to appease those humanitarian people who so wisely understand the need for foreign aid, by talking about Australia’s aid target without setting a date for that target, the Government is once again misleading the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already this week I have had the duty of bringing up a matter of public importance concerning this Government’s misleading of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, particularly in relation to the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This greater trade will, of course, assist enormously in lifting the wealth of this country and the standard of living of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To that extent, when the question of a republic in this country is discussed in the future honourable members on the other side of the House will be able to applaud the actions of the GovernorGeneral as having started the great motivation that <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> now feel towards becoming a republic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While there are many variables in Labor Party policy with regard to tariffs and protection, there should be no misunderstanding which would consciously put <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> out of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Her Majesty spoke of the qualities of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and of the great promise and the great challenge which lie ahead for our nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the heart of my government’s policies lie a commitment and a concern; commitment to increasing the freedom, opportunity and equality of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Territorians are surely considered to be <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, although in view of some of the recent happenings one could not be blamed for wondering whether they are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask Australians who are not territorians to consider carefully the words ‘commitment to increasing the freedom, opportunity and equality of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is important now is that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should realise that we have a government which does not apply itself to this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The prosperity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> depends on the strength of Australia’s productive private sector and on its manufacturing, mining and rural industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, I think the Government certainly had in mind that there is a very genuine desire among many people in the Australian community for a modernisation of the Constitution where it can clearly be shown that reforms would be beneficial to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their placesMr E. G. WHITLAM (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition) (3.15 )- The Fraser Government is continuing to mislead and confuse the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on the issue of uranium mining and export. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  himself has publicly confirmed the Government’s intentionand publicly confirmed its breach of faith with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was merely contributing to rational debate and not the nonsense that I must say both extremes have tried to give to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let this House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> be clear about that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of Parliament- this happens in my electorate and no doubt it happens in the electorates of many other honourable members- are approached consistently by good <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who ask us to try to persuade our Government to put more money into Australian assistance to overseas countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that this Government does not intend to stop with a contribution of 0.49 per cent of our gross national product towards overseas aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on the whole get a pretty good pay-off in the form of goodwill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the questions that has been asked is: What do the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> feel? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a lawyer one might have hoped to amend this piece of legislation to ensure that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> could express an opinion on any number of matters that the Government may from time to time decide; for example, the mining of uranium and matters of that nature could well have been encompassed in what might be called a general purpose provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we are dealing with the tune we are apparently dealing only with the melody and not’ the words, but I do not think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be making their decision on that basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the people of Australia will not tolerate the Attorney-General deciding whether wars in foreign countries are just or unjust, whether foreign governments should be supported or opposed, whether <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can fight for this cause or that cause in a foreign country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think there is any doubt that there is a complete repugnance on behalf of most <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the mercenary who simply sells his services to whoever pays the highest price or where the opportunity occurs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a situation in which the Liberal-National Country Party coalition in this House is espousing one set of philosophies to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, namely, that at least it gives token support to representation of the Territories in this House and in the Senate, and its State counterparts in Western Australia and Queensland are taking deliberate action to deny the continued representation in both Houses of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If those challenges are successful, irrespective of what the decision of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is on 2 1 May- we would hope it would be a decision giving the people of the Territories a right to vote in future referendums- it would be null and void for the very reason that section 128 only gives to the electors in the States- we seek to interpose there the words ‘and the Territories’- the right to vote in a referendum in the same context as they would have the right to vote for the election of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat, if the Government is sincere in its endeavours to prevent <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from becoming embroiled in the internal disputes of other countries, why does it limit the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Government would do a great service to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, both present and future generations, if it agreed to the establishment in Canberra of a national memorial on an appropriate site such as the slopes of Mount Ainslie behind the War Memorial and overlooking the Parliamentary Triangle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> rejected you. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise this morning to speak basically about the attack upon the living standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that flows from some of this Government’s operations- the decision of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission this morning and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are getting sick and tired of the attitude adopted by  Mr Dunstan  and his ministerial colleagues in South Australia in continually misrepresenting the position of the Commonwealth Government on a range of issues and then engaging in criticism of that position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And he will not kid the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As usual the Fraser Government is playing fast and loose with its undertakings to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is about time it informed this House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the way in which it is going to approach the provision of assistance to developing countries at their time of greatest need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s employment and industrial relations policy was put before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> prior to the election in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It assists in relation to marriage guidance, setting up seminars and social functions where the students can meet and mix with <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole program was slanted to pointing out the economic gain for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, but nobody appeared to put the case against that proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Research and science carried out at public expense should return maximum benefit to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is indeed most regrettable that we have seen in this House today that there is still a miniscule number of Opposition representatives of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who are not prepared to have at heart the interests of the nation and the constituents whom they allegedly represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is depressing to think that those members of the Opposition who believe they stand for compassion and concern are prepared to go against the clearly enunciated belief of the vast majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that inflation is our major enemy and that they are prepared to do all in their power, as individuals and as members of the community, to break the nexus which I mentioned earlier between constant increases in prices and wages and, therefore, further increases in inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of record that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were not prepared to accept that proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not fail the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only on the basis of consensus that success can be shared by the entire <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why we are here and that is why the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> elected us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the House should not adjourn tonight until it decides that benefits ought to be equal for all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, irrespective of their station of birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a very serious matter for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and I believe that in the National Parliament the answers of the Prime Minister should be heard in silence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far from signalling a new era of co-operation between the States and the Federal Government, it means the end of co-operation, the end of any joint and shared responsibility for the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The debate vividly illustrates several issues of which this House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be fully aware. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as I said earlier, what the Opposition is really attacking is the whole concept of federalism, a concept which was a major plank in the 1975 election campaign when the Liberal and National Country parties won an overwhelming  verdict of support from  the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other statutory authorities within the Federal bureaucracy could, if the Ministers in charge wanted to do so, easily be amalgamated within those ministries and a great deal of administrative cost to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> could be saved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In the short time available to me tonight I want to continue this discussion on the wages-prices squeeze because I am very disappointed at the way in which honourable members opposite have endeavoured, in concert with others, to break down the great storehouse of goodwill that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have offered to this proposal and the strong feelings they have that it would work to their benefit and to the benefit of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is a government that does not enjoy the trust of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well for us to hear the rhetoric that goes on in this House when responsible Ministers sidestep questions asked of them and ‘sloganeer’ from the other side of the chamber rather than answer those questions, which genuinely seek information not only on behalf of we as parliamentarians but also on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, but what is the Government in fact doing about getting down to finding out what are the problems that are causing the unemployment situation in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rhetoric and sloganeering of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  who actually demeans the unfortunates who cannot find employment in the economic conditions that he supports, will not go down any longer with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The higher standards of living which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> enjoy requires that our individual approach to bounties, tariffs and quotas must be to ensure that Australians keep their jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If bounties are to be paid and if we are to seek to expand an industry there seems to me to be a good case for getting some Australian equity for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the use of uranium may be a short term need in the total scene of the world ‘s energy requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does it not ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what they really believe ought to be done for the future of the mining industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member asked why we do not include this question in the referendum proposals which are to be put next month and get the opinion of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This question is a further reflection of the Opposition’s utter determination to destroy the present prices-incomes pause which, of course, is strongly supported by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- a pause in which the Government has scrupulously observed the original heads of agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well for the honourable member for Pospect to interject because he knows that the simplicity of that proposition commends itself to the overwhelming majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What was involved in that and what we must constantly remind ourselves of, despite the attempts of people such as the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to divert our attention from it, was the simple proposition that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> understood that it was fair to have a price pause in return for a wage pause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is something which will disappoint and bewilder an increasing number of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was someone who is not part of this parliamentary process, someone who is not elected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They believe that they have some divine right to be able to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what it is they should or should not have without having the responsibility of going to the polls every 3 years as a democratically elected government must do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the people here will remember that in 1974 when the Vietnam war concluded there were a number of persons living in Saigon who had been long in the service of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- persons who had been associated with the Australian Embassy and Australian military personnel and who were identified and known by the communist forces in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy will be guided by principles of humanity, equity and compassion and by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s economic, social and cultural capacity to successfully accept and integrate migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will go out to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as gospel truth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> overwhelmingly support the proposals for a prices and wages freeze of a temporary nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not concerned with fine statistical technicalities; they are interested only in the results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can any Federal pressure be brought to bear on the New South Wales Government to end this injustice to this hard working section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ACTU has enjoyed the respect of Australian Governments and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and it is irresponsible for the  President  of that movement to now try and force upon the Australian community a political attitude towards a sporting group from another nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Press release went on to state that the then Prime Minister believed that the great majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> shared the Government’s view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In talking of light, whether it be on the hill or anywhere else, I remind the House that in the glare of the spotlight in December 1975 the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were asked to turn on the lights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We need a return to the work syndrome and the retention of jobs in Australia for <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and not the exporting of them from this country to Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong or the Philippines, otherwise the alternative is sheer social corrosion, which history shows is the classical perilous effect of the lack of the will to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one listens to the speeches of honourable members opposite one realises that even those 3 years when they were in government- disastrous though they were- have taught them nothing about the operation of a sound economy and the benefits of such an economy to the whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In promoting private enterprise we are endeavouring to create employment opportunities for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I support the Appropriation Bills now before the House I hope that, through them, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will realise what a good job this Government is doing and that they will have the sound common sense to keep this Government in office for years to come so that the economy may be returned to the condition in which it ought to be to enable Australians to enjoy the standard of prosperity that our resources should enable us to enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason I make a plea to the Opposition to work with the Government on economic issues, not to continue its policy of obstructionism and negativism, of painting gloom which is unreal, of sapping the confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for cheap political motives and of dividing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important that we settle this particular issue and that we have a song that is respected throughout the world because it represents the desires of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That this House expresses its want of confidence in the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  for deceiving the House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about his policy on East Timor and for misleading the House on 3 1 March about his meeting at Bali in September 1975 with senior Indonesian officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-21-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I direct my question to the Prime Minister and I refer to the problems of the Australian motor car industry and the fact that despite substantial protection the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not have any shareholding in that industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have advocated that there be a referendum on political strikes for 3 reasons and in the confident belief that at such a referendum the desirability of political strikes would be overwhelmingly rejected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government seems to gain great comfort from the fact that a Morgan gallop POll showed that 75 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> initially supported the wage-price freeze. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, having been hoaxed by the promises of this Government in November 1975, when it told  them that all their economic problems would end with a change of government, are looking for some recipe which will give a hope of getting them out of the economic malaise Australia may be in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Out comes all the things that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not know about how this Government obtained agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a great advantage to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in more efficient transport as a result of people getting on with the job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: In view of the exceptionally large support given by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the 4 propositions- to three of them in every State and to the other in not fewer than half the Stateswill he now promptly promote another meeting of the Convention? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On all the specific questions of concern to this Parliament and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, on all the specific charges made in recent weeks, statements supported and repeated by numerous sources and individuals inside and outside Australia, the Prime Minister was resolved to say nothing, and say nothing he did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was to reassure the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that there was no substance in the charges or that the Government was taking action at least to prevent any such activities now or in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this House requires, what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are seeking from this Government and its leader, is an affirmation of the supreme principle of national sovereignty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until he is prepared and willing to give it, whatever the truth or otherwise of the specific allegations that have been made, neither he nor his Government will deserve the respect of this Parliament or the trust of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a pleasure to participate in this debate, if only to bring back clearly to the minds of the members of this House and of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the points that ought to be at issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have tried to imply, by the very way in which they phrased this matter of public importance, that the public is suffering as a result of the very proper steps that were taken by this Government when it came into office, steps which were demanded by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>E passing this blatant anti-union legislation he will ave a fight on his hands and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, on the whole, will suffer as a result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, when will a statement be made to the Parliament on these much delayed matters so that the elected representatives and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will have the same opportunity to be informed about them as those people who have vested interests in the oil industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These have been a matter of some comment in the Australian Press and among <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> saw through that in quick time and gave their judgment on it on 13 December 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The promise of the Liberal and National Country Parties obviously was attractive to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and would have been a significant factor in determining which way a number of people voted at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government had been honest it would have made provision for such factors in the original Bill and it would not have attempted to get the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to believe that they were going to get something that they were not going to get. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, I assert, has deceived not only the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at election time and subsequently, but also the Bench on that occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government really think that it can fool the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that way? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of the Government’s promoting our agricultural products, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are confronted with the spectacle of Minister after Minister, mostly the farming Ministers and particularly the Leader of the National Country <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has yet to show the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that this new policy is in any way of real benefit to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reality which the Opposition does not seem able to face is that in the end it comes back to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even in periods of recession and economic difficulty- indeed, especially in such times- successive governments saw their first priority and overriding duty as the preservation of the livelihoods of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seeks to persuade the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that by throwing men and women out of work all our economic problems will be cured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opposition spokesmen have sought consistently inside and outside this House to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that living standards have declined, but the facts deny that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second is to bolster the Government’s case for an early acceptance of the need to go ahead with uranium mining and export before the full implications of the Fox report sink in with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only has the Government to accept its responsibilities to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in finding the answers to these questions but also I believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must answer them in a manner which will serve the best interests of mankind, not for tomorrow but for the next decade and for the next century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who want to delay our development of uranium bear a dreadful responsibility not only to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but also to the people who in decades to come will be starving because we did not do things now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the policy of the Labor Party, which is being formulated progressively but which still represents sensible objectivity, ought to be looked at very carefully by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sincerely hope that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will take a greater interest in the mining and export of uranium because it is of major interest to the people of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has recognised that the great issues raised by  Mr Justice  Fox and his colleagues in their first report were of such a nature as required the involvement of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been greatly encouraged by the very substantial interest which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have shown in this matter since the release of the first report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will attempt to reflect, in any decision it may take, what it perceives to be the majority or consensus view of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The commissioners have scrupulously followed the implications of this definition and have reinforced the validity of the environment as a dimension of concern, not only to governments but also to all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that not only the Australian Government but all the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were looking forward to that visit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s tactics are a desperate attempt to hoodwink the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; to take the minds of people off the further attack that undoubtedly will be made on the living standards of Australian workers in the Budget to be delivered this evening by the prince of posers, the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the vast majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not selfish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why the Labor Opposition in this national Parliament raises this matter of public importance today, a day when our newspapers and our media generally- indeed, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- are analysing the impact of the important economic measures announced by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is treating the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as fools in believing that it can buy their votes in the short run, assuming that our fellow citizens do not think deeply about issues and do not worry about our ailing economy, including our unprecedented rate of unemployment, and in believing that the people will not choose policies which are correct in the long run and not just temporary, mainly illusory palliatives in the short run. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put that to the House and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the context of the quite catastrophic impact on the non-oil-producing developing countries of higher oil prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Historically, it can be said with complete justification that in terms of their racial and ethnic origins the Palestinians are as mixed as the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It cannot deliver the promises that it made to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would not be able to win an election on the promises that they made in 1975 when they confused the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I leave it to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to judge the content of the speech he just made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable gentleman can wheel in anybody who can put up some kind of opposition to delay the consolidation of unions, he certainly will take that course whilst, on the other hand, he wil go on complaining that the trade union movement is fragmented to the disadvantage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister call for the tape recording of this program and take the necessary action to stop such filth being broadcast to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-23">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He wanted to see Australia- that is, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- build, own and control a pipeline from our western seaboard to our eastern seaboard, to convey the enormous quantities of natural gas which he believed were obtainable from the North West Shelf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He wanted the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to own it so that no one could exploit those who produced the gas and those who used the gas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He wanted to see the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- every man, woman and child in Australia- being an equal shareholder in the exploitation of Australia’s resources of gas on the North West Shelf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to place on record my respect for Rex Connor’s contribution to the Labor Government, which was the plan to ensure that the benefit from the development of Australia’s vast mineral resources flowed to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Setting out to deceive and confuse the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, they have ended by confusing themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should know exactly what has happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cuts in this Budget are the price the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must now pay for the $ 1,000m on remissions, handouts and benefits to the favoured few in last year’s Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On its spending side, this Budget is the complete reverse of what Australia needs, it is the reverse of any common sense plan for economic recovery, for any common sense response to the urgent needs of the Australian economy and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is consciously and deliberately misleading the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about the effects of the tax system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no question, and no member of the House should be under any illusion on this point, that the Government has kept faith with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and, despite the very real difficulties related to the size of the deficit, introduced taxation reforms over the last two years in the range of $3,000m in terms of lost revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of this is that the vast majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have had extremely large reductions made in their rate of tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The taxation revenues from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> rose in excess of 100 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770823_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All it appreciates is playing around with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for political ends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770824_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why I have said, and I repeat, that the Fraser Government has attempted to deceive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about the effectiveness of the Government’s safeguards policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been involved in this public debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-First of all I should like to take this opportunity to commend the Government on an excellent presentation, on excellent statements which have given to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the leadership on this important issue for which I believe they have been waiting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the Fraser Government’s policy fails because it does not allay the fears of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as to the consequences of uranium mining in both the national and international sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of that policy was that the buyers played off one producer against another, forced down the price and the overall return to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> was less than it should have been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that the Fraser Government recognises this, but as with the recently announced import parity price for crude oil it has only a hazy idea of how it will increase the returns to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the ban on uranium mining, 60 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> interviewed by the gallup poll said that they disagreed; 28 per cent said that they agreed; and 12 per cent were undecided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is right that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be concerned about this important issue- the mining and export of Australian uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition does the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> less than a service by its insincerity, its unreality, its inconsistency and, I would say, its manipulation of people’s fears arising from the widespread lack of knowledge about this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I want to make clear to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is that the compelling and overriding argument for the development of Australia’s uranium resources is to contribute to meeting the expanding energy needs of the whole world, and not least of the developing countries, in the context of the increasingly rapid depletion of finite fossil resources, especially oil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put this to the House and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>: Where would be the morality if Australia, with 0.04 per cent of the world ‘s population, refused to make available to an increasingly energy hungry world the 20 per cent of the world ‘s high grade uranium which we possess? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has not become an issue in the community but it is high time that it did because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are deeply concerned with what is occurring in East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>American congressmen and Australian journalists to go to East Timor but will not allow the elected representatives of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to go there is a complete and utter insult to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have said is that we seek to minimise the cost of energy to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Government caused economic and financial devastation amongst the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in less than three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here I have to emphasise my great worry about unemployment because of its social impact upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, particularly young people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But by Thursday and Friday when the economists had had time to do some more accurate calculations, it became patently obvious that the Budget was the most monstrous piece of deception ever inflicted on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When in opposition it successfully, if dishonestly, convinced the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the sole cause of Australia’s economic malaise was the deficit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter for the Government but the Government must take into consideration the views of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the dangers to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to the environment as well as the question of plutonium’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that there is great economic benefit to be had from the mining and export of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having done so it has the full support of this side of the House and undoubtedly it will have the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the House, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the objectors- genuine or otherwiseplus our friends opposite in the Australian Labor Party of the stand that party took when it was in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Therefore there needs to be strongly based manufacturing industries if <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are to be fully and properly employed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s policies that I have outlined today are based on the recognition of the economic and strategic importance of uranium and our obligations to the owners of the uranium, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as well as to those members of the world community with limited access to energy resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great number of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as they understand the situation more, will oppose this measure and will find themselves in no end of difficult situations because of the Acts which now cover this sort of thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the early stages this war did not receive much opposition from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, but as the story began to be told, and as the dangers of that situation unfolded and became apparent to the people in the Australian community, their voices grew and grew to the point where the Government had to take some action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not we who are acting irresponsibily in this matter; it is the Government, because it has no firm safeguards to offer the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> apart from its own rhetoric. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see the Leader of the Opposition in a television appearance simply ignoring everything he has said for two years and pretending to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that this Government has not gone into the matter in very considerable detail and with a very considerable conscience about the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is to the great credit of the previous Government that it had a flexible viewpoint and was able to change its policies when it realised the growing indignation of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in connection with the mining of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view, public indignation will grow more intense as the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> learn more of the detrimental results uranium mining can have, not only on the environment and on fish and tree life but also on the health of our nationals, particularly those who mine it and the unborn, not to mention the raping of traditional Aboriginal lands and sacred dream areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have consistently supported the mining and export of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To produce and export the equivalent quantity without proper environmental safeguards, designed to minimise the further potential risk from proliferation, is not acceptable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to wager the proposition that the pro-uranium lobby that is now spending so many millions of dollars to try to con the media and the public of Australia into the belief that we have some special bounden duty either to the Third World, if that is the argument that the lobby thinks will appeal to the people to whom they are addressing their remarks, or to ourselves because we ought to sell our uranium before it goes down in price, would not be spending a single cent in pushing the point of view it is now putting if uranium were owned and controlled by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and mined and exported for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are changing in ways that the Government is not bringing to the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been taken in from time to time by sudden issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fraser Government is continuing to mislead and confuse the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on the issue of uranium mining and export. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my friend the honourable member for Hunter said, it is an insult to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to suggest that we can be bluffed and bludgeoned into disposing of our uranium for fear that Japan will come and take it from us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether it is action by a few postal workers at Redfern, by air traffic controllers or by people in some other area, when it happens it is those people who seek confrontation with the people of Australia and it is the Government’s obligation to protect the public interest and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in those circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has not been any indication, in spite of the rise in costs in the health care field, that the condition of the health of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> has increased one iota. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it any wonder that when the Liberal and National Country parties were asked by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to start cleaning up the mess the Budget deficit was running at over $4.5 billion? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a tired old approach that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have experienced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can see the way ahead and will accept the challenges of new and exciting prospects in all fields’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not benefit from the fact that at the moment about 20,000 people are out of work because of industrial stoppages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Mr Deputy Speaker, as the debate on this stultifying Budget goes on the anguished voices of the political oncers ring out in this Parliament and the hopes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> run out at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Power without policy is what the Australian economy and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are suffering from. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is to get the economy moving there will need to be a real demonstration of concern for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and real initiatives from the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am delighted that the Budget which has been brought down has been able to give relief to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> particularly at a time when continuing annual deficits have caused massive borrowing programs to be initiated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the relief which we have been able to give to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the deficit has been reduced to $2.2 billion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not deserve the unnecessary suffering which incorrect reporting and rumours of this type cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> now that we just do not pull the money out of thin air. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is disturbing is the extent to which tax evasion has become a way of life for a significant proportion of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There needs to be a taxing system to secure an adequate return to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In speaking on this topic last year I said that the Australian Labor Party believed that local government had a vital role to play in partnership with State and Federal governments in the provision of services to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear about the new federalism but I believe that a thimble and pea trick is being perpetrated on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> learned the hard way during those three years, and they could not survive another dose of Labor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were entitled to believe that that era had ended, at least where water projects were involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what I believe to be the central issue under debate today- the fact that the Fraser Government has made a decision, an immensely long term decision about Australia’s future and to a large extent the world ‘s future, without giving the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> any opportunity to debate the issue carefully and to make up their own minds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With an issue as important as the mining and export of uranium I believe it is imperative that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> be given a chance to know the full facts of uranium usage, to be given time to consider these facts and eventually to be given an opportunity to decide what course Australia should take in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, instead, what the Fraser Government has decided to do is to rush into a decision just three months after the publication of the second Fox report and thereby to sacrifice the democratic rights of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on this vitally important issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is actively provoking demonstrators and unions in the hope that outright conflict will take place so that public attention will be taken away from the real issue, namely, whether or not the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be given a say in the decision about the rnining and export of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister and his Government are so keen to please the multinational uranium producers that they are not willing to allow the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the chance to exercise their democratic rights to decide on the future of uranium mining, because of the risk of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> deciding on a moratorium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If all is rosy with uranium, why pay out all that money to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of its worth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the remainder of the time allotted to me, I would like to give a brief account of the true state of affairs of nuclear power, not the coloured version that the Fraser Government has so far given the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already too many lies and distortions have entered into the uranium debate, and what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> need most of all are facts so that they can weigh them up and make an informed decision on uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are the facts about nuclear energy and its alternatives and not the one-sided half truths that the Fraser Government has been telling the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These facts must be made known and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must be given the chance to decide for themselves the future of Australia’s uranium reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The complete confusion of the proposed resources tax indicates just how incompetent the Fraser-Anthony Government is in the area of resource negotiation on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We want to know, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want to know, the people in the coal industry want to know and the people overseas who want to invest want to know what Labor Party policy is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the problem of relationships between the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> through their government and Parliament here or the local people of Canberra through their Assembly will still remain unresolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second false premise which explains so many wrong decisions of the past 21 months is that it is necessary to reduce real wages of men and women of Australia, the real living standards of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, in order to transfer more profits to the business, particularly the corporate sector- which to them, wrongly, is another  sine qua non  of economic recovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has used others as a scapegoat for its economic inadequacies in curing the problems that greatly affect the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Most sadly of all, not one of them showed any appreciation for the mood, and the aspirations, of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be condemned for the way in which it has presented this Budget to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the new scheme is taken in conjunction with indexation, it can be seen that the Fraser Government is giving back to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on an annual basis about $2,000m a year more than it would have if it had not kept its promise of setting about to reform and reduce the income tax scales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is because this Government that came in on a host of promises has not kept pace with the expectations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In their desperation, Labor tried to conceal the benefits of this Budget from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know perfectly well how long that haul would be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> voted them into opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will keep them in opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will be inflationary and a burden on the great majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Governments should be providing only the foundation for development for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that in February 1976, a few months after the FraserAnthony Government was returned to office with an overwhelming majority of support from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>-that showed Labor supporters what the people thought of their type of government- interest rates were reduced to 10.5 per cent per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The recommendations should be brought forward strongly to indicate to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that tax sharing capacity under federalism is something that is beneficial and that will allow a regionalisation of Federal Government policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government tried to promote to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> an image of a Public Service which was lazy and fat and in which there was plenty of room for wielding the knife. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition in this debate is saying that staff ceilings have been used unintelligently as an ideological bludgeon by the Government against the Public Service and, therefore, indirectly against the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and their very real needs and expectations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not tolerate this situation any longer because everybody knows that the Government is prancing like a cat on a hot tin roof. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Efforts by the Government to use indices other than the consumer price index do not really convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all must share the moral culpability which flows from that action, that encouragement, that aiding and abetting, performed on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by its then leaders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A handful have benefited- mainly internationally owned companies- but there has been no benefit at all to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, in terms of either better conditions or a healthier economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet to find that $1 billion required the dismantling of a whole range of programs of vast benefit to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I therefore strongly support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gellibrand  (Mr Willis)  and deplore the attempt by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to deceive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into believing that this Budget is of any significant benefit to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sort of philosophy contained in this matter of public importance was rejected overwhelmingly by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because it is a proposal which was put forward before the last elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The legislation which the Labor Party is promoting strikes at the very core of the democratic nature of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The legislation is well on the road to denying to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> freedom of speech and freedom on private matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Over the last two years the Labor Party has thought that it can hoodwink the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and con them against all logical reason into believing that the Fraser Government has not brought back responsible government to this nation after three years of catastrophic mismanagement under Labor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us contrast that with the situation in 1975 when the Government of the day attempted not only to fool and to mislead the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as to the nature of the borrowings that were proposed at that time but also to obtain those borrowings through financial intermediaries who had no credibility, no responsibility and no authority in international matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The poll revealed that 36 per cent of the people were in favour of the work he is doing, whilst 59 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were dissatisfied with him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will look for stability because we believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are asking for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member made an interesting comment when he referred to the Senate and the referendum of 1967 in which the present Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Werriwa, and the then Prime Minister, the late Right Honourable Harold Holt, were approaching the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> jointly to have that nexus broken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bearing in mind that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> voted at a referendum to maintain the nexus between the Senate and the House of Representatives, an increase of four senators, for instance, phased in over two elections, would increase the number of senators to eighty-four, as has been mentioned before, and members of the House of Representatives by approximately forty-five. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whilst the present levy was indiscriminate and unfair in operating across the board on all coal company profits, the industry is healthy enough to sustain a selective tax to increase the return to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the view of the Opposition that because companies have been given a national asset to mine and export, coupled with the fact that some have managed to do it profitably, many companies can afford to return to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> some of the benefits which commodity price movements have given them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is inevitable that this legislation will be passed this evening, but Australians of every political persuasion will be calling on future governments to examine processes whereby in the future some reasonable returns will be given to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a result of the exploitation of this very great Australian natural resource. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The accounts did fall out of date, and I have publicly, in front of television, explained the situation to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> whose credibility I prefer to that of the Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771004_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister has said that the policy of the Government is to continue along the stable economic path on which it set itself two years ago, a path of certainty and stability, a path from which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know that we will not depart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> remember that the seeds of destruction of the Australian economy and of uncertainty in so many ways were laid in that era. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a consequence, the Labor Government increased its tax take by over 90 per cent in its three years in office, thereby taking money out of the pockets of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, also robbing the States and giving local government a pretty raw deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there could be no more important matter from Australia’s point of view than that we have the type of intelligence assessment that  Mr Justice  Hope envisaged, for the elementary reason that if this country is to survive in the present day climate it has to make efficient and effective use of its resources, and it is in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that they be so utilised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are telling the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that they have to spend a lot of money on resources which will protect them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am confident that when the history books are written it will be shown that the good sense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> prevailed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Two months after it was elected it went before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and broke its promise to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> completely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s rationale for this continual reduction in the living standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- the wage and salary earners- is that there has to be a transfer of real income from wage earners to profits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unions support wage indexation, but they say that this Government has breached its promise to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about the way wage indexation should apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There would have been a rapid winding down of the rate of inflation but no winding down of the living standards of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know the Government does not care about the fact that their living standards have gone down, but we deplore that it is trying to make so much political capital out of that fact and that it has nothing constructive to say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about the level of industrial disputation, how to resolve it and how to prevent it occurring in future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has guaranteed a freedom of choice for the majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and this, together with the new nursing home benefit arrangements, the payment for services from government pathology laboratories and the payments for overseas trips vaccinations, adds up to a very good implementation of the Government’s philosophy that those people who can pay should pay, and support of the private sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of those facts will the Prime Minister now acknowledge that he misled the House yesterday and that his policies are indeed reducing the living standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The most extraordinary thing about these advertisements is that we have heard for so long, indeed ever since the demise of the Labor Government in November 1975, about the pernicious Press, about the lies of the Press and about how it sold the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> down the drain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The three years from which we are still suffering are still memories far too strong in the minds of the vast majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that particular subject they are absolutely united in the fact that there is no future for foreign investment in this country if ever- I am sure that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will take the ‘ever’ very seriously- there is another Labor government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This advertisement was also authorised by David Combe, the General Secretary of the Labor Party as I understand it, who on 23 April last year declared that the Australian newspapers had committed a fraud on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> during the 1975 election campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were entitled to think that at last we had established a common education policy which recognised the needs of all schools and which recognised above all the responsibility of the national government for meeting those needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At last the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believed that the real debate about the nature and purpose of education in a modern society could begin unimpeded, undistorted, by prejudice and by social and sectarian division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I imagine that the whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will applaud the principle involved in curbing the exploitation of God-given natural resources by private enterprise, whether those resources be coal, uranium, iron ore, zinc, lead, tin, silver copper or whatever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think I have made it clear that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> certainly are prepared to pay for protection but they are entitled to be satisfied that productivity is of such an order that the protection provided is at the lowest level necessary to sustain those industries and those jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all of these areas there have been periodic disruptions which can only lead me to say that sooner or later the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must realise that the Government is trying to do as much as it can to resolve these matters and needs their support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By 1975, when the Whitlam Government was thrown out of office by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, Australia was stricken by more divisions within our national community than ever before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Crean) is indeed a most honourable and distinguished member of this Parliament and a great servant of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shortly after the Whitlam Government received the political count from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> exercising their democratic rights at a free election, the Fraser-Anthony Government, in an honest endeavour to repair what in many cases was irreparable damage to Australian primary producers, as a matter of urgency extended the subsidy at the rate of $78.74 per tonne nitrogen in order to allow a close examination of the whole area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do want to say that a sound and co-operative relationship with the United States is fundamental to this Government’s foreign and defence policies and that the Government and, I believe, the great majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> welcome this opportunity to extend our collaboration with our American friends and allies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is in fact a requirement to assist this major section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to survive and to retain this major industry, which is still a massive export earner, and to enable it to continue giving benefits to the whole of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Bob Hawke has the full backing of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in trying to negotiate and settle these industrial disputes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a total denial of the rights of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, let alone the Parliament, for legislation of such significance to be passed through the Parliament without any real consideration by the Parliament and without any opportunity to examine the contents of that legislation being given to those who are responsible for discussion and putting an alternative point of view to the Parliament on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In spite of what the honourable member for Hindmarsh has said, I am sure that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, including most unionists, are sick and tired of a gang of communists- I emphasise that because it is a gang of communists- in the Latrobe Valley who are holding the greater part of this country to ransom in a stupid and, in this case, outrageous manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That in the opinion of this House the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a right to know more about the underhand methods by which communist agitators manipulate trade unions with the object of disrupting the Australian economy; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

    <p>By the sheer fact of inflation the Labor Party succeeded in raising the tax take from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from $10,00Om to $24,000m in just two years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact that the Labor Government raised the hopes and aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to new heights during the period 1972 to 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  when questioned again today about whether the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will have to go to the polls soon, refused to give an answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently the bull at ‘Nareen’ knows more than the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable gentleman looks back to his own history, I think he will see he has a lot to apologise to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771026_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This clearly accords with the view of the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as reflected in the referendum vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will place only one interpretation on the Prime Minister’s decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When all the confusion created by the Prime Minister is swept aside, it becomes clear that there is one reason and one reason only for wanting an election now rather than at the proper time- nearer the term which the Prime Minister demanded from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> less than two years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The justification for a December election rather than a May election given by the Prime Minister now and hinted for some weeks past is that he is heeding the call by the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> last May for simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would indicate that the honourable member is correct in his assertion that what Labor says is not necessarily right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also am hoping that when I get into the Senate I will be able to see and monitor that this change goes through because it is necessary for the health of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and indeed for the continuance and maintenance of the anti-socialist and anticommunist cause that there should be a change of policy of this character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is more important to submit to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a convention as to the type of Constitution they may want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What we are saying is that this legislation provides the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with an excellent opportunity to have a look not only at this office but also at every aspect of democratic government in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>What better way is there to allow democracy to prevail than to organise conventions of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to submit to them a set of rules for their approval, for their negation or for their variation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those reasons it is very urgent and essential that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> address their minds to the need for a new constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Labor Party wants to disown a contract that this Government might enter into with the United Kingdom to help it maintain its economic stability, it is up to the Labor Party to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> during the election campaign that it will disown such a contract. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why they cannot show the courage of their British counterparts and let Australia meet its international obligations in responding to a world energy problem and developing a major industry will be tested by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were to take it upon themselves as a resource rich country in many different things to say that we were going to deny energy to another country such as Britain, which would fulfil all the safeguards in the most scrupulous way, and thus, in part, be responsible for its factories grinding to a halt, that would be a position that I believe the great majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would not want to entertain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The net effect of that recommendation over a period was that we had a build-up in numbers of waterside workers who were surplus to the numbers required at ports throughout Australia, to the extent that in recent months some 1,200 men who simply did not have a job were still being paid by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From time to time amendments to laws related to taxation become very necessary because of changing economic circumstances and the need to adjust the tax burden on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and also because of progress in the continuing efforts, usually by some unscrupulous professional people, to invent schemes to minimise or avoid taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government accepts the responsibility that it must tax the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the lowest possible level and at the same time not allow unscrupulous people to stoop to the depths of tax avoidance, thereby refusing to accept responsibility to their country, and continually look for ways not to pay taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know about it and they will remember because the unemployed in this country were put in that situation by those new, stupid policies of the Labor Government- new medical schemes, a new free medical scheme, new ways for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to get better treatment and new ways to send people bankrupt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771102_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We believe that the various statements which have been made by the Leader of the Opposition in public to the media, on the electronic media in particular, are deliberately misleading the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on matters of substance and matters of real concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have no substance in fact, and they are deliberately intended to persuade the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in some way that those disastrous three Labor years can be put aside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> remember that the commentary I am now giving from a  Reader’s Digest  analysis of what happened in the Australian economy over those years is the sort of view that the average man or woman in other countries is getting of the Australian status under a Labor government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought to have that debate for two reasons: Firstly, to remind the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of just what happened when he was in charge of the affairs of this nation and, secondly, to remind them that if, by mischance, he were ever given the opportunity to be Prime Minister again he would do it all again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So obsessed was the Leader of the Opposition at that time with his punitive approach to manufacturing industry that he regarded his colleague and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who were concerned about jobs as being nervous Nellies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is right that we should draw the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the fact that the Leader of the Opposition led the most disastrous government that this country has had since Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, we in this House have an obligation to remind the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that, far from having learnt any lessons during the period that he was in office, the Leader of the Opposition would do it all again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have not the slightest doubt that if, during the next five weeks, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are reminded, as they have been reminded today, of what happened between 1972 and 1975 and also - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

    <p>I think two things have been brought home sharply to those <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who are thinking about this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771107_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All I can say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, particularly country people, is that they should remember very clearly the circumstances of 1974 when the fuel equalisation scheme was abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771107_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had no reason to suspect that such a decision would be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is essential that this be done and I am sure that the action of the Government will be endorsed by the vast majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have thought that, since these are publicly owned enterprises and are making profits for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, those who sit opposite- who, after all, are supposed to constitute the Government and who are responsible in the first place for the operations of the statutory authorities- would be welcoming the results and trying to induce from those statutory authorities a better quality of service and a better performance still. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Morris), the Bill before the House- the Transport Planning and Research (Financial Assistance) Bill 1977- is a further clear demonstration of the Fraser Government’s commitment to provide an effective transport system for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and particularly of its commitment to overcome the problems of urban transport in developing outer suburbs such as are found in the southern half of the Kingston electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a sad commentary, I think, on the Westminster system that the talent, commitment and dedication of those three members have been denied to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because of the vagaries and the structure of this political system in that they had been left languishing for 23 years in opposition before they got an opportunity to display any administrative finesse or to make any commitment to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government, of course, will seek to denigrate this statement, to dismiss it with the same arrogant disregard for the truth as the Prime Minister displayed during the recent election campaign when he told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that he could see no reason why health insurance contributions should be increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His Excellency  the Governor-General is a loyal and principled person, quite unlike his predecessor, and it must have disappointed him greatly to have been asked to mouth the platitudes incorporated in the Speech and to have been reduced to the level of a loquacious backslapper for a government of autocrats which is intent on destroying every civil liberty enjoyed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, a government so unsure of itself, so lacking in self-confidence - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If honourable members want to be ruled by the Executive and by the Minister who makes all these regulations- I think he comes from another House- it is their fault, but the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will tell them in the years to come that they made a fundamental mistake in allowing that to happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am ceaselessly amazed at the hypocrisy of Labor supporters who talk about the funding of political parties because whilst it might be reasonable that there should be some sensible look at the whole problem, it is blatantly obvious from what the honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young)  and other Opposition supporters have said on many occasions here that all they are seeking to do by devious means is to have a situation whereby one day they can outlaw, in effect, all or substantial donations to the Liberal and National Country Parties, entrench their own economic conscription from Labor unions, their own theft from ordinary <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that they impose compulsorily, institutionalise it even further, raid the coffers of the Treasuries to get an extra subsidy for their own policies of socialism to take over the remaining parts of the economy or whatever they can get hold of and then entrench themselves even further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I appeal to the doctors of Australia and to the medical profession at large to offer to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> an eager hand in trying to help solve one of the very serious problems that confront the nation and the people, and that is the rising cost of services that they tender. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even that proposal has been watered down because of the complaint after the Premiers Conference that the Premiers want to determine what sort of rights ought to be available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In know that the honourable member for Bowman  (Mr Jull)  who stood for election and was very narrowly defeated in 1 974 knew of some classic examples of that and he conveyed them to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While the objectives my Government has set itself have been endorsed unequivocally by the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, my Government is determined to act as a Government of the whole and not a Government for the majority alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is not to suggest that I believe it is in the short term interests of this side of the House to dwell unnecessarily on the events of the second half of 1975: Rather that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will forget those events at their peril. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In what ways are these giant combines to be made accountable and democratically responsible to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact it is composed of union bashing bullies who shrink “– n confrontation with large scale capital even v when it clearly operates in a way which is detrimental to the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Governor-General has conveyed a frightening expectation to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by saying that the Fraser Government is to continue the same economic policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Never before have the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> been compelled so frequently to the polls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that it is a long-term strategy, a strategy which will be rejected, once it is understood by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, particularly by that generation of Australians reared with the concept of full employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are probably the worst harvesters of water in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can see from the Governor-General’s statement that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are to be subjected to another three years of cynical manipulation by the conservative forces whose representatives pack the Government benches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While claiming to be interested in giving people a ‘greater measure of power’, this Government has taken up the task of making sure that the ordinary <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have less power-less economic power <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The propaganda machine has been working remarkably well, with invaluable assistance from the media owners in delivering the predetermined message to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I am arguing against is allowing the present dominant forces to restructure the Australian economy in a way that suits their interests and at great cost to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in terms of jobs and public revenues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As consciousness grows within the Labor movement and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about the consequences to them of decisions now been taken by the power elite, no amount of propaganda, manipulation or repression will be able to prevent this conservative coalition giving way to a more democratic, more just, more equitable and more independent and self-reliant society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I must say at the beginning that, although I often disagree with the honourable member for Swan  (Mr Martyr),  I agree with him that family life is essential for the fabric of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Governor-General mentioned such things as the tremendous advantages flowing to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from the tax cuts implemented by the present Government and from the actions which we took to keep the rate of inflation down to almost manageable levels, realising and recognising that we have a long way to go in this field and expressing the determination of the Government to carry forward the policies which have proved so successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the most insidious campaigns conducted for many years is the attack upon the real wage structure of Australia which has meant a consistent reduction in the living standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the people in the work force who produce everything which we use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having just won an election on a campaign replete with untruths and misrepresentations, the Government apparently believes that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will swallow anything. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The thinking of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> also will be that for one reason or another we are easily bought off as such donations do not have to be made public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my State and in the electorate that I represent the future of the rubber industry, the textile industry and the motor car industry is important to the living standards of ordinary <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and people with great skill, great technological knowledge and great capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The great destroyer has struck again with his usual deadly aim but I believe that the acts of 1975, 1977 and 1978 will not be forgotten and I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will revolt against them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Parliament should be quite clear about the implications of this recommendation and the circumstances surrounding it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those two standards which he might have been prepared to follow as Minister for Social Security are not good enough for this Government; they are not good enough to meet the wishes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; they badly need to be roundly condemned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Undoubtedly the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been persuaded to believe that it was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s whole economic policy is based on the concept of a trade-off and it is incredible that it has the absolute gall to try to say otherwise to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should be, in every sense, a declaration of commitment by the Government to the needs and aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- all the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On two election polling days- 13 December 1975 and 10 December 1977- the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have indicated clearly that they wish a free enterprise form of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is very depressing to note the hypocritical manner in which this reactionary and authoritarian Government pays Up service to the civil liberties and rights of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Had the Government given careful consideration to the civil liberties and democratic rights and freedoms of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in this matter it would have rejected outright the substance of the recommendations of the Hope report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister’s reaction has ranged from the calling out of the military to a paranoic obsession with security- an obsession which may threaten the liberties of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In accepting the recommendations of the Hope report this Government plainly seeks to smother the aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for a greater degree of civil liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many thousands of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would recognise the name  Sir Donald  Campbell and many people would recognise the achievements of that great personality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately, he has received very little recognition for it in the Press or from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in general. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose the GovernorGeneral’s Speech expresses the Government’s view of the aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am proud to belong to a government that, in an election campaign, did not go around trying to buy votes but which, when returned to office and having the confidence of the vast majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, put into legislative form what it had promised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make that point because at present there is very great concern amongst the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about our immigration policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I mentioned a moment ago, the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will pass their judgment on that aspect of the State Government’s administration at the next State election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is this: Foreign policies were rejected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, foreign policies that were designed to lead Australia out of alignment with the United States of America, with the United Kingdom and with our allies of more than half a century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was the rejection by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of illconsidered and irresponsible decisions like the 25 per cent tariff cut across-the-board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there was the rejection by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the technique of government which permitted the attempted borrowing of $4,000m for 20 years under the title of a ‘temporary loan’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be admitted that this will be a very expensive project and possibly the total expense is beyond the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in terms of priorities in considering all the other significant calls upon the public purse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Mr Deputy Speaker, I am dealing with the sixth paragraph of the amendment which suggests that the GovernorGeneral’s Speech has failed to provide firm guarantees to protect the civil liberties of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is inevitable that the Address-in-Reply should have attracted an amendment from the Opposition, which emphasises again the lack of commonality of view and the continuing concern that <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> cannot come to some accord on the requirements necessary to re-establish our nation on a sound footing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a folly indeed if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believe that they can persist in this extravagant style of living in what over recent years has become nothing more than a fool’s paradise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was one of the speakers at the demonstration, which was called to denounce, to decry and to deplore this crime against humanity and at the same time to bring to the notice of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Christian Lebanese at the hands of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what I really did ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Mr Speaker, there is no doubt that the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are deeply concerned at the events which have occurred in the Middle East in the last few weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it would have been better if the Prime Minister and the Government had first of all instituted a royal commission into the whole operation of the oil industry so that the real nature of that industry and the exploitation of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by the large oil companies could have been properly examined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not do that because it is afraid to take on the oil companies that at the moment exploit not merely the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but also our resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we simply have to ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is: ‘Where are those cuts going to be made? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is indeed very advantageous for this Parliament and for Australia that we appear at last to have reached the stage where the representatives of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on both sides of this chamber can seriously discuss in a bipartisan manner what is a primary  responsibility of this Parliament, namely, the integrity of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think I have ever heard anybody really seriously criticise the quality of the resources and the services that are available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will continue to make known to the South African authorities its strong views and those of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with regard to cases such as that of  Mr Montsitsi  and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780404_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-42-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have thought that from the honourable gentleman’s own experience in government he would know that Ministers do have ideas of thenown, which if implemented can be of benefit to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Government gave a firm undertaking to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> last year that that would be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The depths to which the Deputy Prime Minister has fallen in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the media, the mining industry and his own Party were illustrated clearly last Monday night in his sorry attempt to justify his recent 10-day visit to Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are demanding an answer to the question of why the Government is not doing more to alleviate the growing army of unemployed youth, women and school leavers- people who are wasting their talents and growing more despondent about their future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As my colleague the honourable member for Wide Bay  (Mr Millar)  said, it allows New Zealand to dump its products on the Australian shore and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> pay the penalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I say is that the minute groups in Australian society have paramilitary organisations and believe it is completely legitimate to pursue their objectives not merely overseas by military exercises, that development extends into our own community in a way which is completely contrary to the traditions and practices of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this Parliament must take a very hard line on that aspect and say that the traditions of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are traditions which mean that people can argue freely according to their conscience for any political position they like but that there is no way that this Parliament is going to subscribe or give sanction to the operations of organisations along military lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Parliament has a responsibility to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because many people are struggling with their decision on this issue as to whether they should either support or attend the clinic that has been set up by this man in the Cook Islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again he misled the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Parliament on several scores. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It simply played on the fears of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was explaining before the time wasting point of order raised by the honourable member for Blaxland  (Mr Keating),  that the economic strategy and the budgetary policy of the Government were endorsed only a few months ago in a most remarkable fashion by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst this Government yields to nobody in its concern about the level of unemployment, it does not believe in misleading the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into imagining that the problems of the unemployed can be solved by some short cut, by some fancy solution, that ignores the relevance of inflation and other economic indicators to the level of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was very clearly understood on 10 December last year and very strongly endorsed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In presenting this Bill the Government is honouring its undertakings to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the governments of the States and Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I put it to the House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that if 15 foreign governments are in receipt of this document why cannot the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> be privy to it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The alternative was to increase taxation and slug the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> even more than they have been slugged in recent years in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not object to the free expression of political ideas, but it is offensive to this country if individual persons purport to be representatives of a non-existent foreign state and seek to represent Australian citizens of a specific ethnic origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Merely because he refuses to face the reality of his Government’s maladministration is no reason at all to shield the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from an unpalatable series of truths. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is directed against the Prime Minister because he believes that if he indulges in enough cliches, while adopting an empty posture and misleading the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, somehow or other he will manage to get by the great economic problems facing Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It most of all stands condemned for the way in which it has displayed contempt for the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> today by ensuring that the barest minimum of Government supporters and the two most junior Ministers would be in the House for the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The disinterest of Government supporters in this motion of censure of the Government for its inability to run the economy properly and for the misleading statements by its leaders, particularly the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  in trying to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the economy is in fact, in good shape indicates their uneasiness at the state of the economy and their refusal to listen to the very detailed and strong arguments that can be put forward to show just how badly the economy is being run at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780412_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have made it clear before that when I invited submissions to both these inquiries I invited them from a wide ranging cross-section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is good government because it would be wrong for us, as the tax gatherer, to throw away our responsibility to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to ensure that each dollar that they pay in taxation is being spent wisely and well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>I believe that that is the way to go about giving Aborigines self-management and what was in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when they voted in the referendum in 1 967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result of the generosity of the general tax arrangements we have made with the States, he would be well able to do just that if he were really sincere in his wish to lower the taxation burden on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are just strung along by the way these people operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The quicker the Government can see that this is the problem, the quicker the Government can see that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want to have some confidence in the economy which will lead them to spend, then the quicker that small business will get back on its feet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There seems to be a constant repetition of the words: ‘We do not agree with what you are doing; therefore we will not co-operate in trying to develop for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a proper way of dealing with this problem and a proper way of imposing safeguards’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the dark side of the argument that this Government likes to ignore in its misrepresentation of the facts to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia’s model safeguards agreement, gratuitously sent to potential uranium customers, is denied the scrutiny of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and their Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Provisions of the Act severely threaten the civil liberties of a wide cross section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- those people who actively oppose uranium mining and who urge others to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It rather likes the idea that the sovereignty of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is threatened by tying Australia into the world nuclear fuel cycle, which is controlled at its key points by ruthless commercial and political interests which do not hesitate to move into countries and to crush popular opposition to their commercial ambitions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  has tried just about every trick in the book to sell the idea of uranium mining to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Indeed, one can almost imagine that some of them have been placed on the Notice Paper because it is intended deliberately to take up the time of departmental officers who might reasonably be otherwise engaged in the development of policy and programs which are very much in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Perth and I are concerned about the welfare of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and a new sense of dynamism - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It had the opportunity to show the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it believed that the taxation burden should fall squarely on the shoulders of all people, but it did not take that opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First of all, we read in one of the letters that Magna Carta has been undermined by this measure of the Treasurer; that the liberties of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are in danger; and that their human rights are threatened by this retrospectivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780505_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I can assure them that they have the full support of the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in ensuring that the tax burden is placed fairly and equitably on each and every one of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless there is equity the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will reject any proposal in relation to tax at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have had a very sorry experience in recent years where governments have gone through a period in which the taxation take from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the expenditure undertaken by government doubled in a couple of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the Opposition has chosen to criticise the legislation on the basis that it rejects the new federalism policy is clear proof that it still adheres to its centralist aspirations of bringing all legislative power to Canberra and putting at risk the freedoms of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the very democracy which provides us with those freedoms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This situation is a great challenge to the Australian fishing industry and to the Commonwealth Government to see that this vast new area of responsibility is developed and managed sensibly to the basic benefit of the Australian fishing industry and, of course, to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: whilst not opposing the Bill, the House is of the opinion that it fails completely to provide the necessary stimulus to the Australian economy, and represents the continuance of ultra-conservative policies which have considerably deepened economic recession in this country, created high and increasing levels of unemployment and reduced the living standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do perceive- this needs to be stressed- is that the situation is an extraordinarily complex one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Inflation can easily be increased- as the Government of which the Leader of the Opposition was a member did so successfully- but to reduce it and to restore full employment there are no slick, easy or neat solutions and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> recognise that and will judge the Leader of the Opposition accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although they may have no particular reference to policies, undoubtedly in total they represent significant sums of money for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must have more of the encouraging elements such as export development, research and development, positive investment policies to bolster the move for change, and to concentrate on those things that we do well so that we can do something about increasing the standard of living of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by encouraging manufacturing industry of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will lead to the establishment of another government department, and that will mean more taxation of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not want that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government agrees with the principle of economic development, but let us have no more government departments and no more taxation of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On whatever basis, the prospect is for expanded Australian consular services in more centres at inevitably increased costs, not to provide a travel service for a privileged few, but in order to provide a truly public service for a large and growing proportion of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780526_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not a fact that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, who are expecting some confidence, some efficiency and some integrity from the Government, have received nothing at all? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nothing is being done to restore the confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the problems that the Opposition wants to bring to the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Admittedly the Parliament knows nothing about it, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know nothing about it, but if I can do this will you give Australia access for agricultural products?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we talk about freedom of information legislation, which we have not yet seen, we do so on the basis that the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be informed about what is happening and the likely effects of decisions being made by our government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this the way for a government to answer questions which are of major significance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Opposition says to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> today that they should have a quick look at this Government and at the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again, both the Leader of the Opposition and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition have pursued matters which are not in the mainstream of concern of this nation and they have avoided the main elements of policies which affect the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman also said that as a result of a number of things it was no wonder that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the polls do not like the Government and the style of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there are four instances in which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in a speech, deliberately and knowingly sought to mislead the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-3-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They have nothing to contribute on the central issues of concern to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-3-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Alternatively, is it in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have access to flexible, efficient public policies relating to housing which actively promote home ownership? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It spelt out quite clearly our aims, hopes and aspirations for the housing needs of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The question of housing, or rather the lack of housing in Australia today, is one of the most important issues facing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government failed to inform the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about the details of the special session. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each of these results was promoted by the lack of confidence which people have in the Australian economy, and is it any wonder in view of the schemes that this Government has put  forward  to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as part of what should be a responsible economic program? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find it very strange that the situation which has now been created under this Bill, which the Government put forward as one of its major forms of protection for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, is that nuclear codes will in effect be governed by the desires and wishes of the State which wants to have the weakest possible codes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to express my concern, which is shared by many millions of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, about the number of Vietnamese who are invading our shoreline and about the Government’s failure to do anything to prevent it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is insulting to the Minister; it is insulting to the Parliament and it is insulting to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-22-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think that they get from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the credit to which they are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am convinced that, for that amount of money, which is not a large sum, that has been spent on trade union training in the short space of 2 te years, and to the advantage of 17,000 students, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have never had their money spent so well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable member for La Trobe said, when we find there is a need for a change we have the courage of our convictions and we are prepared to come to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> via the Australian Parliament and indicate where that change should be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Obviously, as the Commonwealth Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> pay the bill in this instance they should have some say in policy matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In practical terms the Bill still does not meetmembers of the Opposition are not objecting to the Bill; in fact we are making the position clear so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will understand what is involved- the standards that apply in certain States at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Alas, Labor Party supporters apparently are going to remain influenced by some of the ossified views of their party, and I think that while they retain this attitude to nuclear energy they must slowly lose the respect not only of other countries but also they will continue to lose the respect of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who recognise the important contribution nuclear power can play in supplying energy to the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This shows that the short term attitude towards the economy taken by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is, to say the very least, in a downward trend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  needs to stay here and face these facts and to listen to a little reality from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> rather than flying away on his ego-boosting exercises overseas to engage in his absurd activities of seeking to persuade others to follow his own inept, unsuccessful, contractionary economic policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Leaving aside the question of such benefits being a right and that such an imposition would be a contravention of International Labour Organisation conventions, will he tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> again that the introduction of job creation schemes has been rejected by the Government on the grounds that for any useful jobs to be created the cost would be four times the benefits paid? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Budget will be of enormous importance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, but the Government cannot get out of this matter because it has raised the matter today and because it has orchestrated the matter in such a way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780815_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We all know that in today’s highly competitive market where we are competing for the appetites of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> one has to put out not only an attractive package but also a quality package at a reasonable price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780817_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government decided to submit to the enormous pressures of groups of conservationists in the interests of giving the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> this wilderness area that they thought was so important, I believe that the Government has an honest duty to give adequate compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780817_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have to protest about these lies, the deception and the deviousness that is being practised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not tolerate that type of violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is direct sabotage of the Australian economy, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the living standards of Australian workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is is one of the show ponies trotted out by the Labor Party now and again to fool the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are there none of the good, solid right wingers left amongst member of the Opposition who will repudiate these actions, who will give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> some hope that there is some sense left in the Labor Party, or are they all hell-bent on their own political destruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will deliver to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  had the audacity to say in his electorate last Sunday that this Budget was well received by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He used to say: ‘The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can be led but never driven’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the measures which are concerning the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget has achieved the remarkable feat of alienating every section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> except the parasites of the stock exchange and their representatives in capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then the lending organisation could take up that certificate, provide the second mortgage and administer a simple and concise scheme with a minimum of cost to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as well as provide additional funds for this important area of housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not accept a return to high taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what Liberal Party expertise and National Country Party manipulation have done to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no more than reasonable that a share of such huge profits from an Australian resource development should be returned to public revenue for the benefit of all the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a Budget which is specifically designed to ensure that the burden, the costs and the suffering which are afflicting <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be borne by the ordinary wage and salary earners, by the people who are unable to take a place in the work force- by the unemployed, by the pensioners, by the sick and the aged- and by the families of this nation which traditionally have produced this country’s wealth but which are rarely in a position to influence the way it is distributed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government recognises that and I say that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> recognise it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, to take up the opening thrust of the Leader of the Opposition, taxes on beer, spirits, cigarettes and petrol are raised and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> very reasonably will grouch about that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, I have confidence that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will see it that way and recognise the need for these measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The standard of living of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> depends upon the strong demands of the trade unions for improved conditions in social services, education, housing and a host of other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is the recipe of the Leader of the Opposition for buoyancy and for the kind of economy to which he would like to return, I am quite certain that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will have none of it, ever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will never forget what the Labor Government did to destroy the Australian economy between 1972 and 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the years in which this Government has been in office it has been restoring balance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and it will continue to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That large hike in the inflation rate during that period did much to destroy the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are important to the young <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- in fact, all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- who want to buy a home or a dwelling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are important to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who want to purchase such items as refrigerators and motor cars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Had the policies of the Labor Government continued through to today the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be paying $3,000m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tax reforms we introduced in 1976-77 returned $1 billion to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So how dare the Opposition bring forward a matter of public importance whose terms state that this Government has caused inequality amongst the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am completely confident that in 1980 the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will make a judgment on this Government’s hollow economic policies and not on the policies of 1972-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not a socialist Labor government; it was a government of the free enterprise philosophy which for so many years in the past several decades has had the strong and undivided support of the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, just as the present Government has for those policies which it is now so effectively implementing to salvage this nation from the blatant attack that was made upon it by socialists like the honourable member for Adelaide and the honourable member for Bonython. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has happened because the Liberal and National Country parties have taken it unto themselves during the last three years to seek to persuade the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- I must say with some degree of success- that there is something inherently wrong in having a deficit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has done nothing to encourage the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to work harder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a truism to say that the Howard Budget is a Budget which unswervingly traverses the road of equilibrium- maximum benefits for minimum government interference to the take-home pay packet of all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether those members of the Opposition who seek to speak in this debate really believe that they can cloud the issue by drawing the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the present situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I want- indeed, one ought to want- to recount some of the happenings and the history of the Labor Administration from 1972 to 1975, to let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know what a decent life they have at present under the free enterprise government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know it, the Opposition knows it and this Government knows it too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That this House expresses its want of confidence in the Fraser Government because of the conspiracy by Ministers, including the Prime Minister, to mislead the Parliament, to mislead the McGregor Royal Commission and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with regard to the Queensland electoral distribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That this House expresses its want of confidence in the Fraser Government because of the conspiracy by Ministers, including the Prime Minister, to mislead the Parliament, to mislead the McGregor Royal Commission and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with regard to the Queensland electoral distribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Four and a half months ago, on 7 April, I told this House that the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  was involved in a conspiracy to mislead the Parliament and deceive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was made out of desperation by the Opposition because it has no attitudes, no purposes, no policies in relation to the main matters of concern to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- the working men and women whom the Labor Party once in the distant past used to represent but whom it no longer represents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no wonder that Opposition members want to talk on topics on which they are the experts- cover-ups, conspiracies and misleading the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, for which they have been condemned not once but twice by the totality of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let no one forget that the Labor Party is the party of incompetence and deceit; the party of the loans affair; the party dismissed from government for trying to rule without parliament; the party that tried by coercion in 1975 to take over the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s savings for its own use as a last desperate attempt to stay in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He keeps trying to hide the fact that, in relation to the Budget, the Labor Party has nothing to offer to the mainstream concerns of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He hopes that his verbal cliches can hide the fact that he has nothing of substance and nothing of meaning to say about the great issues before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the letter was written is further evidence that the Government wanted the truth of these matters to be revealed in their entirety for the scrutiny of this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, after the news reports of his disgraceful behaviour in Sydney where he tried to incite members of the public to go out and to misbehave- they certainly did so- the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> reacted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have had time to examine, to analyse and to realise that he is a man of great standing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, for the second time, returned this Government with an overwhelming majority and turned their backs on the Opposition, which they did not feel was worthy of any consideration at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Millions and millions of decent Australians- the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- want to see this Government get on with the job of running the country, of trying to overcome some of the enormous problems we face, rather than see this penny-pinching attitude of the Opposition of splitting straws and bringing forward the issues it has brought forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are utterly and completely bored with what has been going on- this pinpricking attitude of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That question has not yet been answered for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it has been accepted by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will judge it accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will have no time for honourable members opposite while they continue this course of action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are some of the factors that should have been made known to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when we were discussing these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In all honesty the Government would have to admit that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must have some misgivings about the attitude of France to nuclear explosions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has done this merely to reduce the consumer price index for the next year, not to improve the health services available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must be given the true facts about the extent and nature of the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party had asked the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to forego these tax cuts so that payroll tax could be abolished, job creation schemes could be initiated and the economy stimulated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is behaving in precisely the same way in which it behaved when it was in government and when, in the pursuit of its program, it failed to face up to the real issues which faced the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will not waver from its determination that Telecom Australia must be able to fulfil its responsibility to provide the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with services which are as efficient and economical as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The demonstrations in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne this week have not been an accurate reflection of the attitude of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> towards the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780824_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the great blessings in this country is that the members of the Australian Labor Party will stay in Opposition because they always underestimate the common sense and decency of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be aware that if, following the next election, through some misfortune honourable members opposite were again on the treasury bench it would have the disastrous effect of simply pushing more and more people onto the list of unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By cutting these services the Government is reducing the standard of living of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget also challenges the broad mass of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by so blatantly taking from the majority- by that I mean the poor up to those earning around the average wage, which group makes up 75 per cent to 80 per cent of the community- to make resources available to the rich, the wealthy and also the corporate sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have to ask. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To make Australia attractive and safe for monopoly capital it has demonstrated its ability and willingness to make labour- that is, the broad section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- do all the adjusting and pay all the costs as the big corporations re-organise the system to increase their profits and their powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has to demonstrate its ability to do all this and to control the inevitable reaction and opposition of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather the Government has gone overboard in its aggressive stance against the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nowhere is this Government’s eagerness to advance the interests of big interests more blatant and more contemptuous of the interests and wishes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> than in its attempts to fix up things for the mining companies and the energy monopolies with the commitment of Australia’s uranium deposits to the world nuclear fuel cycle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Potential lenders know- they have been warned by Labor’s policy and by mass demonstrations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- that they will be undertaking a very risky venture if they provide finance for uranium mining in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not acceptable and, whatever is to be put forward to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that proposition will be neglected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Lilley also said that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would not find a higher level of taxation acceptable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great and fraudulent thing about the Australian Labor Party is that it would continue to try to deceive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into believing that it only had to print money to solve a social problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition has sought to deceive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by overstating the additional revenue he could raise by all these means this year by $1 billion or substantially more than $ 1 billion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it also believed, because of a deep and abiding faith in the common sense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would overwhelmingly believe and recognise that the Budget, even if they do not like particular aspects of it, is a responsible document and one that is necessary to take Australia forward to the 1980s and beyond with confidence as a vital and vigorous nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-For the past 35 minutes the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has attempted to persuade the nation that the Budget brought down in this House three weeks ago was a responsible and a good Budget, one which would assist the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and one which should be supported by them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is now desperate to try to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that there is something worthwhile in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, this Budget is not an acceptable product to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by now must be seeing that when he says something the true interpretation of that is not what it seems to be on the face of it but is, in fact, the opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is any promise that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> recall at the last election it was that a Fraser government, if re-elected, would introduce substantial tax cuts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are all very important promises which were made to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by this Prime Minister and all of them were broken after the 1975 and 1977 elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has no credibility because he has told so many lies to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not normally very marked and yet the Government is saying to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in this Budget that with the money supply rate of growth of 6 per cent to 8 per cent we can have 4 per cent economic real growth with the inflation rate at 7 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a fundamental element of every aspect of this Budget and it is no more amply demonstrated than in respect of the Government’s petrol pricing policy which involves a massive increase in the profitability of Esso-BHP not only this year but also in future years when, if this policy is continued, in several years’ time that pricing policy will be giving Esso-BHP something like $1 billion a year in additional profits paid for by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Government is to spend some $400,000 on an advertising campaign to explain to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what the new health scheme means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Irrespective of that, it is a year too much for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Treasurer whether in view of the very great number of representations that have been made and the complicated nature of the Bill itself, as well as the prospects of endangering employment in Australia because so much of the products used are constructed here, just as importantly the probability of endangering our foreign relationship in South East Asia; and also prejudicing the viability of overseas subsidiary corporations if the changes are made, will he give an assurance to the House now, before he goes overseas, that he will give the most careful attention to all the representations and ensure that if necessary, the Act is amended in order to make it more presentable and acceptable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are the circumstances that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want and need in order to be able to purchase their homes, to become renters or buyers and to establish shelter for themselves and their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only by making private industry prosperous that we can expect to create long term job opportunities and it is long term job opportunities that I believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are looking for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am firmly convinced that, subject to the changes that I have suggested- I hope the Government will give serious consideration to them- there is no doubt that this Budget is in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  criticism of the fact that the full extent of the problem of unemployment is being kept hidden from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is well founded and much of the blame for this can be laid squarely on the shoulders of the Liberal Government of which he is a member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But more importantly it would enable the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to own a $60m asset right where it should be and that is in the western suburbs of Sydney where people live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these people should be working in an office owned by the Australian Government and by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780913_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For too long the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been mesmerised by Dunstan ‘s silver tongue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Great effort is used by the South Australian Labor Government to hide the facts from the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and indeed to hide them from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Premier himself goes to great lengths, and in recent times it is alleged that he censored a speech prepared by the head of the State Department of Economic Development because the head of that Department wanted to place before the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the  facts  about the economic situation in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a matter of knocking South Australia, it is a matter of placing before the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the facts about a disastrous State Labor Government which is destroying the prosperity and future of the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has foisted this strategy on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because it asserts that this is the only way to bring down the rate of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without taking into consideration the social factors and the improvement in the quality of life of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, we need that expenditure in order to reduce the social costs of this nation, in order to increase productivity, in order to bring down the rate of inflation and the unit costs which are so much a part of our rate of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can he say which one the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should believe? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, that same senator earlier this year managed to get 29 members of the Labor Party to sign a document saying that the Party should explain its socialist objectives to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> more clearly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Leader of the Opposition really speaking on behalf of the Opposition or is he now trying to hoodwink, to softsoap, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by pretending that he believes in the private enterprise, capitalist system? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what about all the lies that have been told to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in that three year period since the Government took office? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the Government would hope that by 1980 when the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are called on to vote again the electorate will say: ‘Oh,  Mr Street  told us in 1978 it was going to become worse; there is nothing that can be done about it; we have to accept it’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a whole scheme, a whole avenue of lies which were told to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about what the Government is going to do as far as employment was concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations prepares the way also for conditioning the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into believing that there will be a great deal more and permanent unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On our side of the House, we say that the Minister finally has come to the conclusion that the truth ought to be made known to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inside or outside the Parliament the Prime Minister has told lies, all along the line, to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the achievement of this Government- a government of deceit and dishonesty, a government whose Prime Minister, as I said, is telling lies and who now criticises and overrules the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations for having the cheek and the audacity to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the truth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1977 election campaign we as an Opposition did our best to persuade the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to see beyond the convenient and hollow promises of the Prime Minister made in that infamous policy speech, now revealed as a litany of empty rhetoric and base deception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members opposite feel that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are stupid enough to listen to the sort of stupid inane criticism which has been bandied around the House today and if they think that they can win votes by making remarks such as the ones that we have heard today, I am sorry to point out to them that it will be proved again at the next election that Labor is just not on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Parliament belongs to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we do not give consideration to this aspect, persons outside the Parliament will continue to press for changes in the parliamentary system which would affect its operation and could destroy the institution as a viable part of the Government and the representative voice of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780919_reps_31_hor110/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the claims are correct, will the Minister initiate action in conjunction with State authorities to prevent the excessive use of salt, particularly in baby food preparations, and to warn the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that too much salt is a health hazard? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The conflicts and allegations over the proposed development of uranium in the Northern Territory have brought the hypocrisy of this Government squarely before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has to be a limit to the amount Australia can absorb and the number that <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want to see. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-25-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that tourism in Australia has a great future, but what is lacking- I make no great criticism of the industry itself, but I do make a criticism of the Australian nation and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- is a pride in what we have in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-25-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to make a couple of points because I think that the honourable member may inadvertently have misled the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about the imposition of this tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It applies to all people leaving Australia and, therefore, it is not raised just from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope we will finally get a declaration from the Government that there will never be any oil drilling on the Reef because if oil drilling is permitted or even if it is suggested that drilling will be permitted, I think the Minister will be in for the greatest battle of his political career, certainly on the conservation front, as I do not believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will tolerate oil drilling on the Reef, anywhere or at any time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has actually decreased the tax burden on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am proud to be associated with a Government that has introduced tax reform for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to talk briefly about the 1  Vi  per cent surcharge that is being imposed on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I agree that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should have them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I want to do is to ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to recognise that although it is true that some people’s taxes will rise in terms of the amount of money they pay, the fact is that the money which Australians will be paying overall in taxes this year in real terms that is, in terms of what it can buy will be less than the taxes they paid last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Prime Minister reassure this House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that he has not used his family trust for tax minimising and avoidance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Minister’s statement as well as the publicly expressed concern of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the treatment of  Dr Orlov  will demonstrate to the Soviet authorities the strength of our commitment to basic human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That indicates that the policies of the Government and the words of the Minister are correct: The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are interested in owning their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In our view they amount to a cynical repudiation of past promises to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there is one pan of the election last year which would stick in the mind of each person in this country it would be that the Government parties went to the polls in 1977 saying to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>: ‘If you elect us you will get substantial tax cuts’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has decided totally to repudiate its promise to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, a promise which was the key point in its election policy last year, by imposing an income tax surcharge which will totally wipe out the tax cuts for the majority of taxpayers, particularly those taxpayers who are lower middle income earners, and substantially reduce the tax cuts for the rest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone can understand that if we take $560m off the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> they are going to have that much less money to spend and, therefore, there  is  going to be less consumer demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet the honourable member for Gellibrand had the hide and the audacity to stand up in this place and say that this Government is over-taxing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are now starting to understand this proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Health says, it puts money back into the pockets of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These tax arrangements represent a serious breach of faith with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that at the first opportunity the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will show their indignation against the decisions of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be gratuitously afforded the opportunity to view the verdict but not the evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-22-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The magnificent vote for Labor last Saturday in New South Wales shows that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> now realise increasingly that the conservatives’ economic policies are wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Parliament is the forum in our country where all the issues of concern to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must be raised without fear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not concerned only about unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are also gravely concerned about our reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one of the serious questions being asked today by so many of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could it be because they were lying to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the time of the so-called loans affair? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did they mislead the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> then? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These enormous costs add up to another reason why the Treasurer is duty bound to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, through this <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suggestion that the Opposition has flushed out and discovered something that we have been concealing from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> makes me think that it is Rip Van Winkle from Adelaide who has been completely oblivious to what has been happening in the conduct of this country’s external economic policies over the past 18 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Did he come clean with the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when he talked in rhetorical terms about the $324 per head debt? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that is good enough for either this Parliament or the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Government’s decision on the Fox inquiry and the potential danger to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from the lethal legacy of the past, will the Minister treat these matters as urgent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was no secret about it, but it was never told to the Australian nation, to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In signing a memorandum of agreement at that time the Austraiian Government sold out the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s interest to the British Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was plain from the Minister’s opening statement that the problem of plutonium waste disposal in the Maralinga area has been handled in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and no matter what the Opposition has cared to say to refute this it has utterly failed to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should at any time in the future some unforseen circumstance show that it is possible to gain access to the material, even though at the present time with given technology this is not so, obviously it is the responsibility of the government of the day to take every conceivable protective device necessary to ensure that the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are always covered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should not come in here three years later and complain, because when they were in Government, when they had the responsibility for the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, they demonstrated a total incapacity to carry it out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are victims of circumstance, and the hearts and minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> go out to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pay tribute therefore to any government which makes funds available to decent <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who give of their time and energy to bring the light of day to unfortunate people such as those seen by the honourable member for Petrie and me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I advance the thought to the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  and the Minister for Construction  (Mr McLeay)  who are at the table, that when considering forward planning for good, decent living for all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, they bear in mind that under the arrangements for the payment of family allowances and tertiary assistance there is some discrimination against big families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-After the last Federal election, in which the Labor Party was resoundingly rejected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, it set up a committee of inquiry to guide it on its future plans and policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When will they ever learn that that policy will never be accepted by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as long as they understand what is before them under Labor policies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we want to know is how they can possibly justify this to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will have this exposed to them at every turn by the Liberal-National Country Party Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that in respect of this clause, as with all the other major clauses of this Bill, the Government has broken its convenant with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will treat them- as sanctimonious hypocrites. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, in the present set of Bills, in addition to the range of optional deductibles which were promised in May, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been offered a massive front end and very attractive optional deductible which, as many commentators have suggested, may well make financial nonsense of the whole scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The non-insurance Commonwealth segment of the scheme is, in fact, very much a massive front end deductible which, if a major choice is made in that direction by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, may well create serious financial problems for the present proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly, whatever we think about this latest scheme, most of us would say that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been so messed about with health proposals in the last three years that we should at least give them a chance of stability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, the latest permutation on the medical provision for this country was not primarily designed in the interests of the health care of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been rejected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> time and again and they will reject it again in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to the discredit of all Government members and the AMA that they take this position and place their interests well ahead of the interests of the majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously this motion has been brought forward only to divert the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from the faults in the Labor Party and its total inability to find policies such as those which this Government is pursuing and which the Labor Party would seek to alter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> clearly recognise that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why, despite the rabble-rousing attempts of the Labor Party to whip up mass opposition to the Budget, the common sense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> has prevailed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have accepted the Budget as a necessary step on the road to economic recovery and prosperity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781017_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would greatly increase the demands of government upon available loan funds and, under a Hayden alternative budget, there would be a significant increase in the long-term bond rate and, as a consequence, on private sector and other interest rates which affect the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition wants to bring home to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that here again is another broken promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781018_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their arrival is also causing concern to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but, as has been pointed out in this chamber, Australia could never turn back the Vietnamese, with their leaking boats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why cannot the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have the benefit of the ideas of the Opposition, or does it have none? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one thinks of other people such as  Sir Alan  Carmody,  Mr Currie, Mr Scully  and  Mr Wood  one realises that that department has given a lot to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only result will be the betterment of the welfare of all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who does not want to face that economic and historical reality has no right to sit in this chamber and say ostensibly that he is representing an electorate of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, people who, incidentally, have demonstrated a lot more common sense than he ever has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  made a certain number of points when he made a statement a few weeks ago- a very courageous statement- which put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the realities of the position facing us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be solved at the grass roots of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have overcome greater problems in the past and will certainly, as a nation, find solutions to them in the present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that basis the Leader of the Opposition can stay where he is and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will keep him where he is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At a time when greater employment opportunities are being sought for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, such strikes by small numbers of people who do not know where their interests as citizens should lie lead to further high levels of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>But in this particular industry in the last few months, what we have seen has been an almost co-ordinated approach by members of various unions to sabotage the future welfare of the entire <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth Government has always been concerned to ensure, as far as possible, that Australian oil refineries had adequate capacity to meet the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that they were efficient in order to provide supplies of high quality at least cost and that they were operated in conformity with the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The main thrust of the amendments it contains has three principal aims, all of which are directed towards creating an improved framework which will assist the Organisation to continue to serve the nation well in the years ahead and to optimise the benefits to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that can be derived from national government-financed scientific endeavour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781025_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It concerns me that the Government has been prepared to put to this Parliament a proposition which effectively removes from the ambit of the Governor-General or the Auditor-General the power to prosecute people who have behaved in a way in which they should not have behaved and who have caused damage to the property which ultimately belongs to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the taxpayers, and which is administered on their behalf by the government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781025_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I conclude simply by saying that this legislation is a disgraceful measure in that it demonstrates that the Government has no confidence or enthusiasm about the powers with which it has been equipped by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to get on with the job of stimulating our economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The past week has not only shown up the Minister for what he really is but also it has left the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in general wondering exactly in which portfolio he is interested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-40-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It still becomes very difficult for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to know whom to believe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-40-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have reason to be grateful to the NLC and the traditional owners of the land in the region, for this very generous gift of their land to the Commonwealth, to be enjoyed by all as a national park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be welcome Christmas news to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would be surprised if the great bulk of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> did not understand that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact seems to be that the great percentage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a predisposition to seek to obtain private insurance for additional cover and to seek to insure themselves for doctorofchoice for hospital attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nonetheless, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have made their choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What the honourable member for Prospect is saying really is that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are dumb; that they are stupid; that they do not know what they are doing; that they cannot think. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are wasting a lot of money on education in this country if the great majority of the people- we are talking about 70 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- have not been able to think out what they want, even when the Labor Party introduced its Medibank scheme, when it provided expensive universal cover and when 70 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> insured themselves for their choice of doctor and other ancillary benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The health system always has been an enigma, but I think it is true that it has never been a greater enigma to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> than it is at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should be asking whether the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are being met by this Government’s new scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having misled the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by claiming that the size of the deficit is the principal cause of the rate of inflation, the Prime Minister now has to find ways of increasing public spending without increasing Budget outlays. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this policy continues, there is no doubt that it will continue to the detriment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As we respect them, so we feel our duty of glorifying their last moments as they deserve; and by our doing so the names of these heroes will remain in the hearts of the British and <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for evermore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is he coming into this House seriously asking the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to believe that if the Hayden Budget had remained in place and if the Whitlam Government had remained in office after 1975 it would have introduced indexation and would have adjusted the Hayden scales of 1975? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This seems to us to be a very curious role for a body which is supposed to be a screening device, which is supposed to ensure that foreign investment which comes into Australia operates in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and not some sort of advance party welcoming foreign investment on almost any terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government abandoned all ideas of imposing a resources tax which may have ensured that very profitable investment projects and resource areas would have given much greater benefits to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> than is currently the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They certainly will not get it while this Government moves away from the guidelines which operated when Labor was in office, guidelines which were thoroughly sensible and in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth Government has always been concerned to ensure, as far as possible, that Australian oil refineries had adequate capacity to meet the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that they were efficient in order to provide supplies of high quality at least cost and that they were operating in conformity with the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What do honourable members think that the union leaders will be doing when 5 per cent or 10 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are put out of work, however temporarily, by this dispute? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition is accurate when he says that there is very little that the Commonwealth can do in the democratic system that we have if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want to stand up and in a widespread way revolt against any sort of lack of fair play. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a debate brought on by Government members because we believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> need to be urged to act in their own best interests and absolutely go against the actions of a small number of unionists who are acting against them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I would like the Minister for Transport in his reply- he has the right of reply if he wants to exercise it- to tell honourable members the rate of interest that Ansett Transport Industries will be paying on the money for which the Australian Government, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, are guarantor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All of these are directed towards creating an improved framework wrixon will assist the Organisation to continue to serve the nation well in the years ahead and to optimise the benefits to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that can be derived from national government financed scientific endeavour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Once again the Prime Minister is attempting to deceive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have a Prime Minister who is pursuing his own ideological obsessions against the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time the Prime Minister was expressing a concern about the degree to which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are prepared to accept the Government’s putting the country into hock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to be somewhat concerned about the trebling of the official debt of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>that public funds should be used for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and not to promote the contest for power by political parties, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that that point of view is unacceptable, and ought to be unacceptable, to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposition would involve some sacrifice on the part of both the Opposition and the Government, to the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be the beneficiaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have demonstrated very clearly that they are not as negative about constitutional reform as is sometimes thought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me assure him that we will continue our stance in seeing that there are modifications- and there will be modifications provided there is resolution on the part cf the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, apart from the benefits of tax indexation, it is important to remind the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Opposition of what this Government has done with tax avoidance during the last 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who are seeking work, as distinct from those who are in work, will not allow such remarks to go unnoticed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is estimated that this year there will be a total production of approximately 13.8 million tonnes and the return to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to the Australian wheat industry will be of the order of $ 1 .3 billion to $1.4 billion, and that is a huge sum of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>But we are giving warning to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it is necessary to retain the quality characteristics in the Australian wheat crop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the meantime it was the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who were right in refusing to recognise and trade with a government of murderers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781121_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has lost the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the majority of whom it has punished consistently for its own mistakes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Prime Minister is trying to say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is simply this: ‘Don’t judge us by what we have promised in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is a censure motion of the Government relating to a number of matters of which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are well aware. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should the Government not be defeated from the point of view of what it promised the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and what it has done? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should be borne in mind that, luckily for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the Government will face an election within another 50 parliamentary weeks- about 150 parliamentary days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the Government does not put itself up any more as a government that represents the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and as a government which has honoured its promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not get any action out of the honourable member for Shortland or the Labor Party because in the whole period it has not brought forward any aviation policy at all, nor has it brought forward in specific terms a policy in relation to international aviation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that the number of registered unemployed has increased by 230,000 since his Government has been in office and is now 6 1 ,000 above February last year, will he now admit that in both respects he completely misled the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But they are always the favourable statistics, always the statistics that the Government can interpret in some way to try to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that a very serious problem, the most serious problem during the last 50 years of Australia’s history, is beginning to turn the corner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have come to recognise that the Government has to get the money from somewhere and this Bill results from a budgetary decision in line with another obvious need in the country to look in a more sensible way at the overall pricing of fossil fuels, which are becoming scarce, which we need more people to look for and which need a certain degree of conservation brought about by a more realistic pricing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790220_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

Miller the greatest national political handout beneficiary by promoting him to highly paid Government positions on the board of Qantas Airways Limited, on the Meat and Livestock Corporation and as organiser of the Australia bicentenary celebrations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I still have that optimism about 1979 and the future because I know what can be done with the Australian economy and I know what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are capable of achieving even in the face of great discouragement and adversity given the proper encouragement and the right sorts of policies to back them up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to the House that whilst the Opposition has made and no doubt will continue to make a variety of charges about this Government’s economic policy, the one that I think is least sustainable is the proposition that this Government, from the time it was elected, has not made very clear to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> its principal economic goals, and furthermore that it has not stuck to those goals during the past three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reject completely the charge of an unwillingness on the part of this Government to set down its economic policy in forthright and succinct terms understandable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable member for Cunningham had any real sense or understanding of the importance of a person who is the  chairman  of the largest company in Australia, he would realise that to denigrate in any way the success of that company denigrates the fortunes of literally hundreds of thousands of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and any suggestion that the success of a company of that size is not the nation’s success is a complete misunderstanding of some elementary facts of Australian economic life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that this situation is not lost on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister is not good enough- I do not believe he is any longer good enough to be trusted by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- I have greater respect for  Senator Guilfoyle  because that lady has usually kept her pledges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So this Government is meeting a very substantial commitment for the health and welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and, in particular, for the aged population of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790221_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, Government acquiescence to private capital incursion into this field maintains the Government’s position as the lackey of private capital at the expense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That sums up the attitude of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the fact today is that people have far more money and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are far more affluent than they have ever been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are affluent and they are starting to benefit from the policies of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statistics of employment in other industries reflect the growing affluence of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a movement because of the demands of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in these fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A study of those figures shows the affluence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> coming through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What can be achieved is a continuing improvement in living standards for the majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those achievements have been made by this Government and those achievements will continue to be made and will be shared amongst the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know, and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know, that it is far more than that; it is afire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the Parliament, from a bipartisan position, that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are very concerned as to what this <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Prime Minister’s popularity sinks to 35 per cent it is a true indication of what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> think of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what is worrying the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as importantly, there will immediately be an increase in inflationary expectation because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have seen what that sort of behaviour has done in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are looking for the first opportunity to redress this miserable situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things that has characterised the Hayden Australian Labor Party is its persistence in trying to talk down the economy, in casting gloom across the nation and in trying to display the Government as incompetent, impassionate and inhuman in its approach to the management of the affairs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> realised what they had done wrong in the elections of 1972 and 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the view that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should take to this Government on its past record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite were content to talk down the economy and to create fears in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and in particular in the minds of the Australian employers and employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well I have news for them: This is a game called politics and we are going to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the facts and let them judge for themselves who is fit to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister’s message about the state of the nation is the message of a Prime Minister who is unable to go before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and honestly tell the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are adult enough to be told things of this nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should recognise what this Government is doing about the serious question of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790222_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are fundamental to our system of government and to the proper standards and responsibilities the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> expect from their political representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet within three days the Minister was able to put behind him this crisis of conscience and, condoned by the Prime Minister, expect the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to pretend, without any explanation, that it never happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are sick and tired of the Labor Party’s peripheral politics and its pettiness over personality questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have put their faith in this Government to guide them to a new era of economic prosperity and strength. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We warn the Foreign Minister that there are very distinct limits to what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can tolerate from him and from the other former Army Minister, the present Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not a single opportunity was taken by the Opposition to debate foreign policy as a matter of public importance, this most pressing issue of concern to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement made here today by the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  was not only a concise and expert coverage of the very difficult situation facing Australia and the Western world but also examined matters which this Parliament, as a matter of prime responsibility to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, must take very seriously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As this Government perceived in its policy to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the time of the 1975 election, whether we like it or not South East Asia could be the Balkans of the 1980s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst members of the Opposition have failed utterly in recent days to present to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a demonstrated foreign policy we, as the Government of Australia, have no choice but to live with the realities of the circumstances facing us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been told by the Opposition how churlish it was for the Foreign Minister to call in foreign ambassadors to ask our ambassadors around the world to bring to the attention of the governments to which they are accredited the concern of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and of the Australian Government at the circumstances in South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I call on every member of this Parliament to give a lead in trying to alert the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the very serious situation which we now face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This House, and through it the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, have inadequately and belatedly been informed by the Government of developments in this war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today or tomorrow- I am not sure which day- I will be receiving from Eric White and Associates, a plan- a concept- which has been funded by the Commonwealth Government, that we will be able to put to the Australian Energy Council on 9 March, next week, so that we will be able to discuss with the States a national publicity campaign and a concept which we will be able to put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> along with our pricing decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, the Fraser Government has shown once again its inability to plan properly for increased international competitiveness in our industries, its inability to minimise adverse effects of change on thousands of working people and its inability to build up techniques to negotiate meaningfully on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with great and powerful transnational corporations whose interests are not necessarily the same as those of our nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that the only perspective that this Government can adopt with integrity and a proper sense of responsibility to Australia and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole is that this development must be seen as a breakthrough for <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One had only to read the 1974 report of the IAC on the automobile industry to realise that we were going to be locked in but we did not have to be a patsy and a pansy to the demands of one company to turn this industry upside down without being able to give us the professional, sophisticated answers to which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are now seeing that organisation being given further generous treatment and this time at the obvious expense of workers in the vehicle industry and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a sell out of the Australian workers in the interests of the corporate sector which is the real enemy of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole and which in the long term we have to defeat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790228_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one goes beneath the surface one sees that the profitability of BHP is of direct concern to literally hundreds of thousands of ordinary <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because the shareholding in a company of that size does not involve just large shareholdings of individuals but, through superannuation and pension funds, the fortunes and profitability of that company benefit ordinary <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So to the extent that the Leader of the Opposition and his followers denigrate that sort of performance they are indifferent to the interests of those ordinary <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The total capital cost of the program will be about $ 15.3m, which is not a significant amount, I suggest, in view of the fact that salinity already is costing the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> some $4m per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, the rights and freedoms of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are the most jealously guarded in the Western world and are the envy of many nations both near to and far from our shores. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ought to know and ought to be delighted by the fact that investment in mining and manufacturing has increased by 33 per cent in the calendar year of 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They show that since this Government has been in power, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been paying less tax than they previously paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government, through its efforts to stop tax avoidance, has been able to carry on with these tax reforms which will benefit the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak particularly of those people who by far represent the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So why is it that the Prime Minister deliberately seeks to mislead this House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when he says that capital gains taxes will affect ordinary people’s homes or that the Opposition would levy wealth taxes on workers’ savings? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be warned at this early stage that if the Labor Party ever came to government in this country again, there would be a very real risk that it would seek to introduce a capital gains tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790301_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Treasury Economic Paper Number 3 entitled ‘Flexibility, economic change and growth’ is nothing more than a paeon of praise for the market forces of the economy: Keep government out of it and ignore the sorts of structural engineering that the Crawford Committee is recommending to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Frankly, the members of ASEAN and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not know which voice to believe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are all happy to see the introduction of cheaper air fares for Australians travelling abroad, for <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> visiting their relatives abroad- hopefully they will bring more people into Australia to stimulate our economy-but what about the people living in Australia who want to travel within Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another promise in the 1977 election campaign was that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not accept a return to high taxes and a Fraser Government will bring them down further, not increase them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790306_reps_31_hor113/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If not, can we forecast possible future  problems for the health and welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is about time that we started to direct our attention towards policies that are designed to try to improve the general health standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The continuing concerns of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in respect of the uranium industry focus especially on nuclear waste disposal and nuclear non-proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it thinks it will have any success through these tactics it has gravely misread the mood, the intelligence and above all the sense of fair play of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So we can look forward to having around people who have this kind of claim upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for the next 40 or 50 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are talking about a mammoth commitment by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at that time and what I believe to be a moral demand upon us to examine the situation and to ensure that the commitment that they accepted is met with equal commitment on our part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That does not alter the fact that this Parliament has to appropriate funds, has to make decisions and is responsible to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for the defence of this country and for ensuring that the funds so appropriated are spent properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will enable this Parliament to participate more fully in the defence debate and to discharge its responsibilities both to defence and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in a far more adequate manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this context I believe that the caution of the Foreign Minister about Russia is both understandable and in the direct interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and world peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think part of the difficulty that we face in this situation is the fact that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s own regional isolation and European heritage have left us singularly ill-equipped as a community to understand the complex mix of historical, cultural, territorial and international factors that have led to the war currently raging between China and Vietnam, and Vietnam and Kampuchea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be of great concern to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that Opposition members, with a few notable exceptions, have sought to reserve their greatest invective not for any of the participants in armed conflict, not for those countries where human rights are not respected, but for Australian governments of the present and the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government which has a great record of broken promises to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- an unprecedented reputation in that regard- is now surpassing that by starting to breach promises that it has made to other governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790327_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for National Development- we have lost the word honourable today- told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in his Press statement of 13 February, after he met the oil companies in Canberra which must have been a nice sleazy meeting, that after discussions with oil industry representatives he was satisfied that there were no grounds for concern about the immediate outlook for the supply of petroleum products to the Australian market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790327_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have made that quite clear to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790327_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me make it absolutely clear that I have not misled the Parliament; I have not misled the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790327_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not know what else I can say but to say what I have said again tonight, that in no way have I been acting in collusion with the oil companies, in their discussions with the PJT, on their decisions on discounting or on the issue of whether we conspired to stop the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from knowing the true position of the oil situation in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790327_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Opposition and every honourable member in the House: If I have been misleading the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as to the true situation in Australia and it is now six weeks since I made that assessment and made it public, have I been right or wrong? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790327_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Port Adelaide has tried again and failed- to suggest that the Prime Minister is disporting himself on the international stage, using extravagant luxuries supplied for him by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We want to know exactly what programmes are going to cost and exactly what the commitment to the Department of Finance and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be in that fiscal period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This new building has to represent that and we will be putting up a representative symbol of the aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790328_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are fairminded and they will agree with the Government’s view that, if a person refuses to perform his normal duties, there is no earthly reason why he should be paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reality is that this Government has, since that time, had to reverse substantially its original ideas in regard to taxation and break its fundamental pledge made to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in respect of income tax at the 1977 elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of this is that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are far less well off than the Prime Minister promised they would be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole process has been done in a totally inequitable way as well as being a fundamental breach of a promise made to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now all that means that the Government has tremendous and very expensive promises to recoup to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have challenged the Treasurer time and time again to say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that an income tax surcharge would not be levied again in 1979-80. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> today that he will not renew the legislation for an income tax surcharge in the next financial year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is simply absurd to keep arguing, as he does, that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been saved $3,000m by the introduction of tax indexation by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Ways are available- we have pointed to them- to raise tax revenue in a way which would lower the burden on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He said that one of the greatest tasks the Party faced was a massive rebuilding of the public sector and that the only way that it could do that would be to persuade the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that they had to pay more tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Opposition is really a low tax party and if it really argues that it would have a lower rate of taxation if it were in government, why does the economic spokesman for the Opposition say to a conference of Labor economists that one of the principal tasks of the Labor Party if it is returned to office in 1983 will be to persuade the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that more taxation has to be paid in order to rebuild the public sector? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not go into any kinds of vagaries when he announced to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it would be possible for a Liberal-National Country Party government to achieve an immediate change of direction, to restore growth rates immediately and to get the economy moving again in a way that it had not been moving over the previous three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He refused to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what he was going to do because he wanted to achieve power and was prepared to do this in any way that he could. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has not only criticised the Government and suggested that its policies are not working in specific directions and indicated in detailed ways what might be the social impact of particular policies but it has also begun to sketch out an alternative direction to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will recognise that at least the Labor Party is on about a fair deal and helping the ordinary wage or salary earner to get equality for his dollar and not have it ripped off him by tax scales that are extremely inequitable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On a simple cost benefit analysis, the nil costs associated with the Minister’s power to withdraw or withhold a passport of a suspected corporate criminal as opposed to the expensive costs of extradition and the loss of investors’ money associated with corporate criminals who flee, it would seem that as a result of the proposed new practice in this Bill the Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are paying and will continue to pay a substantial price in the cause of human rights and civil liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I make it clear to the Prime Minister that, if he believes that he can get away with this confidence trick by telling the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that he will not permit drilling on the reef but only near it, then 1 fear that he is sadly mistaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Principal among the effects of those changes in respect of the people of whom the Leader of the Opposition speaks is the fact that under those changes 500,000 <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are no longer liable to pay any income tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would hope that, after listening to this debate, he would try to arouse the indignation of members of this Parliament, which expresses the opinions of many sectors of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, towards this tax dodging that occurs on his island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The income tax surcharge, which the Government assured the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be for only one year, is due to end at the end of this financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the light of the results of the elections held in 1975 and 1977 I wonder whether the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want ever-increasing handouts or socalled middle class welfare? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> appeared to know what they wanted when in 1975 and 1977 they voted for a government that they knew would be tougher on expenditure and would, by its philosophy, have a lower tax aim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important to remind the House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that his Government, in which he was Treasurer in the later stages, presided over the greatest rate of inflation in Australia, the greatest increase of unemployment and the greatest lack of confidence that has ever been known since we became a Commonwealth in 1901. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In February of this year $577m was made available to provide housing for <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This indicates that the scheme, which was the brainchild of this Government, has gained credibility in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and is playing a meaningful role in bringing hope and confidence to people who otherwise would be forgotten. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are always open to a natural disaster, be it fire, flood or the droughts which occur with monotonous regularity in the Australian rural industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The longterm sequel to this policy is that dividends will be repatriated overseas in massive amounts and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will bear the brunt of this Government’s unfortunate policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact it widens the choices that are available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in any field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But we sincerely ask the Government to think about broadening the range of members who are on the inquiry and also broadening the reference to enable strong inquiries to be made as to how the financial market, the capital market, as it exists in Australia at the moment affects the great mass of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is high time that the horror of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the illicit traffic in heroin and other illegal drugs is expressed in terms of the penalties proposed in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not ignorant of what has happened to our youth, in many areas, over the last few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pay a tribute to the members of the judiciary for also being part of the legislative process by indicating to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that they will ensure and are prepared to ensure that the Australian nation remains free from the totality of dangers from drugs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are not too many people in Australia who are unduly concerned about the difficulties faced by the people who live in these areas and who contribute so much through the wool industry and other primary industries to the welfare of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But when he starts to use chicanery and double-dealing in his dealings with the Commonwealth over very important legislation, I believe that he should be exposed to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has cost the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> some $50m, and still there is no market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been a dramatic increase in the burden of overseas borrowings on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I recall, and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will recall, that at the time the then Opposition mentioned only the extent of the loan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, perhaps worst of all, the Whitlam Government tried deliberately to deceive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the outset, I express my concern at the fact that a member of the Australian Labor Party would see fit to criticise an initiative of the Government which has as its prime aim and objective the ensuring of more jobs for <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until recently the concept of travel or tourism as representing an integrated and recognisable industry- an industry in the traditional Australian sense- has not been accepted by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of the Federal Government- more correctly, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- to clean up oil spills that occasionally occur from the scuttling of fishing boats and the flying of Taiwanese crew members down to Brisbane and then to Taiwan will be untold thousands of dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790508_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The development among the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of tolerant understanding of the situation has not been helped by the antiVietnamese propaganda of the Australian news media. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have spoken about government initiatives concerning three matters which identify the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and our nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They want at any price the minerals which they can sell to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and make it look as though they are being fair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But over the last 20 years there has been a great advance in the attitude of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> towards the rights of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its purpose was to give permanent rights to the Aborigines and to establish absolute, unqualified obligations on the part of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>to secure, control and retain reserves of petroleum adequate to meet the long term needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Countless other examples are on the record and etched into the hearts and minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was a very successful tactic of deception and misrepresentation npt only of the Press but also of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me explain what the Treasurer was about in seeking to deceive so successfully not just the Press but also the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members should note that the two speakers from the Opposition in this debate, the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Gellibrand, are responsible for the economic statements of a party which still believes that one of the first obligations of a re-elected Labor government will be to go about persuading the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that they ought to be prepared to pay much higher taxation in order to rebuild the public sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that on the quite realistic assumption that the Labor Party would not be elected to government at the very earliest before 1983, one of its first jobs would be to go about persuading the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that much higher taxation was needed in order to pay for an expanded public sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The then leader promised the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that that was what would occur in December 1972 if a Labor government were elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members on the Government side and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know that it is the Fraser Government that has done something about tax avoidance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-For the last quarter of an hour the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  has blustered and thundered away on the subject of taxation, but he has not given any assurance whatever to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about the charges that have been made in the Press and in this Parliament that this Government is considering once again breaking more promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a quarter of an hour of prime time in the Parliament, the Treasurer has refused to give an assurance or a guarantee to the Parliament or to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that this Government is not about to break further promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly, what this Government intends to do is break its promises once again in this fundamental and important area of the tax burden which is imposed on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1975 and 1977 this Government gave assurances to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that a lower burden of tax would be imposed on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice from the results of the opinion polls on the popularity of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  that the Labor Party is not doing too badly at trying to con the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into believing that this Government is a government of broken promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the record of the Opposition on taxation and that is the record that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> need to remember. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that is what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one can believe what is written in the newspapers and broadcast by the media this morning, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want smaller government, they want less taxation and they want less money transferred out of their pockets to go to those people who are already well off or to Governments which will spend it unwisely through bureaucracies that have built up so grossly in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Due warning was given in 1972 by the then Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Whitlam,  when he told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that he would use the inflationary aspects of taxationeverincreasing taxation because of inflation- in order to fuel his grandiose programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, he always has much to say but he used a good deal of mendacity- something that annoys the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and certainly annoys me a good deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the type of capital gains tax that the Labor Party wants to introduce, as is shown by its record, will be well known to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by the time of the next election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is carrying on about this whole matter of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> not being able to know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Liberal Party says: ‘We must not let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do that because we cannot trust them’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, if a communications base which has the general purpose and function of a communications base ceases to be a communications base and becomes something else, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ought to be told that it is no longer a communications base and, for example, that it is now part of a navigation system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Liberal and National Country Parties had recognised that at the time of the 1975 elections I wonder whether they would have been so dishonest in making such lavish promises to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> which they could not in any way keep. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is far from the sort of incomes policy that the present Government is seeking to foist on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by this present wages policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now say to those finance companies, and other speculators which may shift their attention to the making of profits at the expense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> through investment in uranium mining, aluminium smelters and other hazardous industries that will affect the future of our cities and the way of life of our people; you will get your fingers burned again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will intervene in the supply of those resources that belong to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is not interested in the kind of conflict which is absolutely essential if one is to wrest control of Australian cities and urban development away from interests which are certainly not inimical to the well-being of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he has to make a choice, his choice is in favour of the speculators, his choice is in favour of the property dealings, his choice is in favour of the crooks that have been ripping off the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> over the last decade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words,  Mr Camm  is more concerned with keeping faith with American oil companies than he is with keeping faith with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Over the past week we have witnessed an extraordinary exercise in political gymnastics and deception by the Fraser Government over its consideration of the sale to private enterprise of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s domestic airline, TransAustralia Airlines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no way that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can be convinced that this kind of expenditure is justified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, it is obvious that they have imposed the dead hand of small government on the Australian economy and, what is worse in human terms, on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight, with that sort of record behind him, the Prime Minister had to send his Treasurer into this House to announce that, after three and a half years in office, his Government will have to rip another $ 1,300m from the pockets of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-44-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have had enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-44-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It almost seems superfluous to emphasise that the Minister and the Minister’s advisers in repeated statements to this House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in general who are interested in the payment for health care have repeatedly said- other organisations have talked about itthat we need more data; that we need more facts; that we need to allow things to go on for a little longer in a particular way before we can change them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-46-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If circumstances change we will respond to those changes, in pursuit of our commitment to full support for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, through Budget policies that will bear down on inflation and which will meet our commitment to the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the policies which helped to bleed almost dry the consolidated revenue which is taken from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and, therefore, the taxpayers, was Medibank itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is an incredible document but, this policy having been put forward, one wonders whether too many of the honourable gentlemen opposite will be swayed towards adopting a policy which, on my estimates, will cost the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> an additional $700m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member sitting opposite has a tremendous responsibility not only to his Party but also to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to let us know just what Australian Labor Party policy is and just what the Labor Party would do in regard to bulk billing if it were elected to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until we can find out what the Government is threatening to do to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> it is a little difficult for us to determine a policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s excuse for all these enormous breaches of promise- that is the reduction of living standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the increase in taxes and the whole array of matters which I have just mentioned- is that we must have Budget responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the central and overriding election promise and commitment of this Government is to restore the Australian economy- to beat inflation and to get the economy on the path of economic growth with stability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that the majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> recognise the central fact of life that, in the final analysis, all our national social and economic objectives are dependent on the achievement of a sound economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as indeed the thrust of most editorials in newspapers around the country, understand and appreciate that point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Almost half a million people are out of work three and a half years after this Prime Minister made that commitment to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real issue that we of the Opposition want to put before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is what has happened to the credibility of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite also should remember what happened when the Labor Government went to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government went to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and said: ‘Can we try and get some control over the economy?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main thing that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are learning is that if they want things they will have to pay for them one way or the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in 1975 that all they needed to do was to put the Liberal-National Country Party coalition into power and all would be well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is regrettable that some members of the Press- those wily fabricators of the scare tactics and cataracts of crisis and tumult- have endeavoured to inculcate in the hearts and minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the fact that the Government has departed from its planned program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that there was an expectation in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that after 30 June this year they would have a greater take home pay packet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have to be made to realise that if the nation wants more government input it must be prepared to give the Government more revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is absolutely appropriate for any government which is looking for revenue and which wants to leave the Australian taxpayer with more of his own money to take money from the oil companies rather than from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe in good, honest and decent government and a policy of security for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> so that they can plan their own programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We remind the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that if the Hayden Budget was still the norm in Australia, the Australian taxpayers would be paying $3,000m more in tax than they are paying under this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I applaud the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  for introducing an initiative in supplying $500,000 to make the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> aware of the necessity to be health conscious and not to adopt an attitude of running to the doctor at every pretext. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The worst aspect of the package is that it involves the destruction of the confidence that <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to have in any government, even this government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can the Prime Minister, elected four years ago on the promise that there will be jobs for all who want to work, walk honourably amongst the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are getting from this Government, because it is unable to fulfil promises it freely gave to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, is a reversion to the dole bludger syndrome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has been a great government of tax reform and it has done its duty to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in regard to tax avoidance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very fact that the Board might change a decision in the light of information given to it indicates only that it is capable of arriving at a decision which it feels is in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> even though it might change a decision made some time earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, late or not, I have brought it to the attention of this House because I believe that this Parliament has an increasing responsibility to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to ensure that its agencies in gathering information, as they must gather it, do not misuse the information to the disadvantage of innocent citizens in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The judgment of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will go far beyond the petty actions of the Opposition in this Parliament because the package will be respected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been working to strenghten the life, the vitality and the vigour of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That attitude unfortunately has persisted in equally ineffective Opposition denigration of the now successful efforts of this Government on behalf of Australian producers and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real author of last Thursday’s perfidious statement came into the House, not to defend the statement but to do what he normally does, to sermonise and preach to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every government in the course of its stay in power will make statements which it sometimes has to repudiate but I am sure that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> think that election promises require reverence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only things falling in Australia are living standards and the expectations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the bulk of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who need help with legal aid are being denied that help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appealed to the greed of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them- too high in fact- fell for this appeal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were seduced by the promises that were made by the Government and failed to respond to the Labor Party’s appeals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fraser Government, in opposition, brainwashed the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into believing that inflation and unemployment, which were too high in the Labor Party’s years in office, were not in fact a world-wide phenomenon but were peculiar to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our tourist Prime Minister calls for austerity from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> while we, the taxpayers, are supplying him with incredible luxury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can the Government hope to call on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for austerity when it behaves in that way? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would engender in the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> anything except confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the sort of situation in which this Government has the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He had the gall to stand in this place and sermonise to us about his vision for an <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, leading the people into the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us be very clear what that means and let us understand why the Treasurer has announced the imposition of further burdens on the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who benefit from these profits are not the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> whose resources are exploited or the workers who produce the goods and services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means that this Government is so willing to boost the profits of the corporate sector that it is prepared to impose huge burdens on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fraser Government now faces a situation whereby its deficit forecasts have blown out, not because it has tried to provide services to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- in fact it has not; it has cut back on them- but because it has been redistributing public funds, and funds that do not exist, to serve private profit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it has decided to squeeze the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> even more by imposing higher tax burdens on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Between 1972 and 1975 the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were treated to economic mismanagement the like of which has never been seen before in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the last 24 hours, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have listened to an Opposition which still promotes policies which contributed to the serious economic downturn in this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party, as expressed through their spokesmen during this debate, are once again asking the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ‘to endure the unendurable’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> showed decisively in 1975 and once again in 1 977 that they were not prepared in any circumstances to endure the economic hardships forced progressively upon them during 1973, 1974 and 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This commitment, this promise, if you like, to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, enunciated first in 1975 and reaffirmed in 1977, is being honoured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790529_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite obviously, a large part of this would not have been possible were it not for the face-f.o-face negotiations that I and other senior Ministers have conducted on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the Australian exporters and the Australian farming communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, of course, a convenient description for him to use to try to cloud the issue and confuse the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and those who are looking for work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the real impact on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the swinging increase in taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assure the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> however that this Government will not lightly increase taxes in a real sense until all the possibilities for pruning unnecessary expenditure have been examined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the upshot, the total of personal income tax collections for 1978-79 will not be much greater in real terms than they are this year, thus preserving the essential and overriding feature of the gains which the Government has achieved in reducing taxation in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What concerns the Government, and undoubtedly it would concern the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, is that we have had this tremendous increase in the net operating costs of hospitals throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has adopted a very responsible attitude on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in respect of the supplies of oil which have been discovered in Australia, the existing oil fields and the future oil wells which we know must be drilled because Australia needs to achieve a satisfactory degree of self-sufficiency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This measure will effectively give to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, in the form of revenue to the Government, a substantial increase in revenue if prices set by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were placed in an unfair position as a result of that type of approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ought to note that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like also to express appreciation to the media for the way in which they have responded in bringing to the notice of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the importance of increasing our export performance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On any view of this concept the people of Australia will reject it not merely because it involved broken promises and stands as a permanent record of this Government’s dishonesty, but also because, from any view of this legislation, what is now being structured as a so-called health program is expensive, inefficient and socially divisive of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and a completely socially inadequate response to the health care needs of the average Australian and his family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> voted for a comprehensive national health insurance scheme in 1969, 1972, 1974 and, because it was then part of this Government’s election manifesto, also in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will accept its attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to know what concessions were made to  Mr Bates  that led him to alter his position from a resignation in protest against the form of inquiry to be undertaken by the Government to a position where he was prepared to withdraw that resignation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not have the numbers to stop what was originally an $80m impost being drawn from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, but at least this amendment will reduce that amount to $73m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the Opposition will vote against the Bill at the second reading stage and at the third reading stage as well because we believe that it is an unnecessary revenue-raising impost on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is contrary to common sense, contrary to the procedures of this House and contrary to what we present to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> continue to maintain these companies in business and these people in employment when they refuse to do much, if anything, to help themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> really understand the nature of the help they are giving? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the matter of a fair go for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, who have a Minister like this involved in the affairs of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir, we all know that the Government has got the numbers, but we on this side of the House are entitled to look to the Chair to protect the rights of this Parliament because those rights concern the rights of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My prime aim will be to provide honesty and integrity in government Tor the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-8-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important thing that needs to be noted by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, I believe, is that oil spills are very damaging to the marine environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister whether on 21 November 1977 he promised the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that he would make ‘an Australia which is strong and secure, which cares for those in need’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790821_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has plucked $ 1,000m out of the pockets of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by a sleight of hand and it wants them to believe that this has happened because of the Arab decision to raise the price of oil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790821_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let him come clean with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by telling them what would happen to incentive under a taxation system that provided for a marginal rate of 75c or 80c in the dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let him tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what the Labor Party’s funny money wealth tax ideas would do to the confidence of small business people and farmers in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last financial year 86c out of every $1 collected by means of personal income tax from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> was spent to meet the cost of health and social welfare at the Commonwealth level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, in reference to the Whitlam Government’s period of office, it is quite clear from the results of every gallup poll that what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are now interested in is the health scheme for which the Minister is responsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a very good reason why the integrity of this Government must at all times be doubted and why every action it takes must be vetted very carefully in the interest of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Prime Minister now concede that this Budget substantially increases the overall burden of income tax and further reduces the living standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a right to a new and open inquiry into the sale and transfer of ownership and control of WIN4 and Channel 10 to expose the scandals that I have mentioned and to rectify the injustices perpetrated by the Minister and those who are supposed to be responsible to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be formulating a policy for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a course that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not accept, do not tolerate and will reject, and it is not the best approach to non-proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has to look only at the policies it decided and as soon as these policies are understood by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, what the Labor Party fears most will happen, namely, the present Government will be returned at the next election with a substantial majority probably equalling its record majorities of 1975 and 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For four years we have lived with a government that has tried to convince and persuade the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that being paid $5 1 a week is too much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For how much longer will the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> be prepared to accept the pack of lies that we have to make these sacrifices in order to get down inflation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, he promised the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> full economic prosperity in three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Last week the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were presented with the sixth Budget from this Government and the third Budget from this Treasurer  (Mr Howard). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That decision, as the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> came to learn to their cost, had absolutely nothing to do with their spirit being sapped but everything to do with their vote being conned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has squandered the last vestige of moral authority with his party, with his Parliament and with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Total revenue raised from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a proportion of national income has soared to record levels under the so-called low-tax Fraser Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He knows, and those behind him know, that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> no longer believe him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They declared war on themselves but they also declared war on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last night the Leader of the Opposition once again tried to deceive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not fall for that as an economic alternative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless the Leader of the Opposition is prepared to face the consequences of having an economic policy which is silent on inflation, unless he is prepared to say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> how big a Budget deficit is appropriate, unless he is prepared to come clean about his taxation policies, unless he is prepared to say how much his alternative health scheme will cost, unless he is prepared to cost his job creating schemes properly- in other words, unless he is prepared to match his rhetoric about economic responsibility to show us that he does have some interest in economics and that he can advance an alternative economic strategy, he is simply not going to be taken seriously by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a few matters that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have not forgotten over the past  Vh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear much from the Opposition about the living standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A debate like this about the living standards of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ought to give us an opportunity to look at what has happened to the Australian economy during the past 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party may not be prepared to face facts, to be realistic, to take the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into its confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let me assure him and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>,  Mr and Mrs Australia  about whom he speaks, while in the same breath mouthing policies that will do great damage to them and their families, that this Government will not refuse to face the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would take issue with his concluding remarks, wherein he stated that this legislation is just another example of the aggressiveness of the Government in getting money from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That must indicate to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that we are a government of compassion and concern because we are allowing more people to be covered, and we have allocated an extra $29. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: Are the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to be constantly subjected to a dribble of health increases? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, by the Fraser Government’s low standards it is politically honest because it forthrightly shows its disregard for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has given the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the greatest tax reforms in our history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not accept a return to higher taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the chips are down the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not have a bar of this man or the petty pessimistic nonsense which has become his stock in trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The headline which appeared in the  Age  yesterday is the sort of headline of which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> take note. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the stuff of economic development and progress and the provision of jobs for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Indeed members of the Opposition delude themselves and they would seek to delude the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that there is an alternative, a quick way via increased government spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, last year the net capital inflow into this country of $3,025m was an all-time record which in turn means development and jobs for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appeal to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to appreciate this point and to adopt the proposals the Government has suggested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can a man who as Treasurer of a Labor government which reached the dizzy heights of plus 17 per cent inflation come into this House and put to the Australian Parliament and through it to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a so-called strategy which offers nothing but more of what we had before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Government was defeated by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in a historic manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That scandalous situation will be deplored by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister for Primary Industry give an unequivocal assurance to the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that he supervises the financial affairs of his Department and the statutory authorities under his ministerial control in a full and proper manner? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am delighted to be able to tell the House that not only is the tourist industry in Australia obviously now getting a large boost from the number of people starting to come into the country, but also indeed the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> themselves are able to gain some benefit from the introduction of the cheaper air fares regime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the present Administration the wealth has been transferred from the great bulk of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the wealthy corporations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer also to the reduction of essential community services that affect the quality of life for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government has eroded the base of the public sector and weakened the ability of the elected government to intervene to protect the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said earlier that this Government would be remembered as a government of broken promises, and I think there is a very good reason why the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should look at this Government as a government of broken promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, the end result of it could well be the exact opposite of what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not know of the very stringent work tests applying to the unemployment benefit and how quickly this Government will take at the slightest excuse a person’s unemployment benefit away from him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I said before, and I make the point again, that most <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not know the very stringent work tests that are applied to the unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of being frank and honest with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the Government, since coming to office, has deliberately set out to falsify the figures by making it harder and harder for those who are unemployed to get benefits in the hope that they will drop out of the lists of registered Unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is really no need to reiterate what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> think about the Government’s broken promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not be conned; they are too smart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an absolute disgrace that a group of people which purports to be an alternative government announces that type of policy to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This program upon which this Government has embarked distributes fairly to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the revenue that the Government gains from many sources, including income tax, excise duties and a whole host of other taxes which are levied on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That includes all the excesses of the Menzies era and the high taxation paid by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> during that time because of the extraordinary inflation that took place during the 1950s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it should be now clear to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it is impossible for them to go on having faith, either in the economic policies advanced by this Government or in the Treasury gremlins that guide them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no way in the world that a majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will fall for believing that, because the Australian Labor Party has changed captains, the crew will behave any differently than the reckless, destructive way in which it manned the vessel between 1972 and 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are telling the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> honestly and firmly that, if the State continues under the economic management it has had for the last 10 years, its decline will continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the fact that he embarked upon this Canberra bashing exercise, the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have realised that that is an old trick which is used by people who know that things at home are in a bad way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should find better ways to motivate <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> than promoting a television program and thereby putting money in the pockets of the television advertising agencies and the pockets of the large companies that control the television stations in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that they underrate the intelligence of the ordinary <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the Australian public, when they try to pretend that they have all the answers, that they can solve all the problems of inflation, when obviously from their own record they cannot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When ASIO was set up it was set up for a reason which was quite clear and which was known to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In making our expressions here today, we should, at least, have the freedom in this House to express our concern on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who are the people we represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I see it, the more the shape of the Australian economy is determined by the decisions of big corporations that are increasingly locked into a system of foreign control, the more burdens will be placed on the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposed Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act is based on a belief that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> need to be more seriously protected against terrorism, especially those forms of terrorism that are manipulated by foreign forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be protected against terrorism, but the best form of such defence is to build up a strong social system of security where the people are prepared to defend the common interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reality is- this kind of political statement is not understood by most people in the media and certainly not by Government members- that the real foreign threat to the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> comes from the powerful transnational corporations and their associated institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not too sure what are the intentions of the Government about this Bill, but I do impress on the Government the need to proceed cautiously, the need for less haste in order to give every consideration to the Bill, thereby allowing people in the community and members of parliament to scrutinise properly all sections of the Bill and the need to proceed at a very slow rate so that the Bill, when it is finally drafted and finally put into law will be a Bill that reflects the common view and the acceptance of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As indicated earlier, I second the amendment moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  and believe that if the proposed amendments are carried they will make this legislation far less partisan and more worthy of support from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we do return to the sort of universal health insurance scheme that was inherent in Medibank the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will pay dearly and the medical profession, the providers of health care, will be the greatest winners in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless they are there, we will never be able to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that ASIO truly represents their interest, collectively and, in so many important cases, individually. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that we should be involving the Director-General of Security in situations where we give him a definition that is so broad, so wide that he finishes up having to involve himself and having to involve his service in what has been described as spook activities which are directed towards the legitimate rights, the ligitimate expression of view and the legitimate exercise of the civil liberties of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a wellorchestrated federal conference in Adelaide the Leader of the Opposition did his best to deceive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into believing that the Labor Party had learnt its lesson now that Gough Whitlam had been deposed, that the new leader, the present Leader of” the Opposition, is now a chastened man and has learnt his lesson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a mean and demeaning change from what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> expected and got under the Whitlam regime, which was a period of at least an attempt at some form of egalitarianism in Australia or an attempt to rectify the great imbalance that existed traditionally in Australia between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have nots’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But, more importantly, the basic failure of this Budget and of this Government has been the failure to inject into the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> any confidence in the future of their country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that a lack of confidence is an academic, almost ethereal thing, but it certainly permeates right through the ethos of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and their thinking, to the extent that people now have lost confidence in their ability to retain their jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the fear of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is obsessed with the deficit- as it always has been- and that is one of the reasons that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have lost confidence in the future of their country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This myth has been repeated by the Press, and it is a myth of which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be aware. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This continuing wage strike and the way it has been painted by the slanted Press has led to a lessening of confidence in the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> realise that this Government has put them in hock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a nice situation for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to find themselves in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget is something to be deplored by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will come to weep for themselves before very long as the dead hand of the conservatives in that State tightens its grip around the throats of the workers of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The people sitting in the galleries representing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> demand to know from this Government what is going to happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-12-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If ever they are unfortunately given the opportunity by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to be back in government these policies must be brought into law by those people who are dictated to by the left wing of the Labor movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if we are to solve these problems, then I think that we have to appreciate, as I stated earlier, that the Budget must be interpreted by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as being more of a working agreement between the Australian community and the Government rather than a document designed to cure all ills, irrespective of the action or desires of the rest of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides many of the things that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> thought appropriate for the economic circumstances that the country is facing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The time has come when the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will react to this sort of character assassination which has been carried out by the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has brought great disgust from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for that sort of performance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret to say that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have failed to grasp how inflation rises disproportionately among them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian people</span> fail to comprehend- they are given little assistance in understanding- that the fundamental structure, the distribution of income and wealth, is at the root of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not confident enough to let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know of their alternative Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these things indicate that we are a government of low taxation; we are a government that believes in letting the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do with their own money what they deem to be appropriate rather than adopting a big brother attitude and saying: ‘Thou shalt do what we tell you’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That was under a government which had pledged to support the worker and to preserve the jobs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know of the great concern for providing employment opportunities to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> shown by the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder),  the honourable member for Dawson  (Mr Braithwaite),  the honourable member for Mallee  (Mr Fisher),  the honourable member for Cowper  (Mr Ian Robinson)  and the honourable member for Paterson  (Mr O ‘Keefe). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I endorse their great fight in providing employment opportunities for <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am delighted to see that once again the Government has proved to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it has honoured its promise- that is a government that is open in its proposals in various areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are coming to believe that they cannot trust this Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  or this Government to redistribute wealth in any other way than in favour of the more affluent and powerful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s policy is increasing the tax burden on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and this burden is significantly higher under the Fraser Government than it was under the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The deficit has remained high and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been left with a growing tax burden and more and more unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Gellibrand spent a few moments talking about the interest debt, the per capita debt which has to be borne by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in meeting the interest on bond issues and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interest debt burden that lays upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> now was generated overwhelmingly during those three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The nature of the deficit to which the Bill is directed needs to be supported because it deals not only with the economy this year but also with the burdens which will lie upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the mid-1980s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have asked the Department to furnish a report to the Government on what action, if any, should be taken to protect the health of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we see that the Labor Party is still devoid of any real ideas about effective economic management and real job creation for young <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier this year when the question of oil drilling on the reef was headline news almost daily a public opinion poll was published in the  Sydney Morning Herald  showing that 66 per cent of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> opposed drilling on the Barrier Reef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears to me that the Labor Party is not concerned with the health, the safety or the welfare of the community because it would deny the Minister an opportunity to act for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every honourable member here knows that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want legislation such as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure you that the Government is committed to the protection of the health of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard, it is particularly important that members of this Parliament tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> why it is necessary that they should on an individual basis do all they can to support the appeals which are currently being mounted by non-government organisations such as Austcare, the Australian Red Cross, Community Aid Abroad, the Australian Council of Churches, Australian Catholic Relief and the Australian Freedom from Hunger Campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely that is not too much to ask of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who in this part of the world are so far ahead in terms of their standards of living and the quality of life that they enjoy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In days yet to come the program announced by the Australian Government and the attitude demonstrated by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be remembered not just by the people of Kampuchea but also by the nations in the region in which we live and in which we will continue to exist for many years to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The real point is that we have to say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>: Wake up, time is running out’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is very valuable for the House to hold this debate today because it brings before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> an understanding of the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are sick and tired of arrogant trade union bosses calling them out on strike without any reasonable cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman imputes to the Government and me motives for engaging in an advertising campaign to awaken the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the fact that no Commonwealth benefit is payable for medical fees up to $20 as from 1 September. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be very concerned indeed if a significant percentage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were unaware of that fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make it very clear that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be very wise indeed to maintain their health insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is wrong in law and it is important that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the trade unionists and particularly the people of Western Australia know that the laws in Western Australia contradict the principles of human rights and the principles upon which the laws of public assembly should be based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can see through this and they will not have a bar of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party will be judged on this issue amongst others at the next election and will be totally and completely rejected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any investment yielding a return two or three times its cost is a good one, especially if it is to the lasting benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, because of the severity of the problems in Kampuchea, because we believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> wish to provide some particular and additional help and be a part of that help to Kampuchea, we have made the decision that for this financial year aid to Kampuchean relief will be a tax deduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accordingly, he has set upon a tack designed to mislead the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact,  Mr R.  J. Hawke in July last year, in one of the most outrageous attacks on the impartiality, independence and integrity of the judiciary, accused the High Court of raping the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> through its decisions on tax matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would not matter if I were a member of a Labor government and this Bill were our legislation, I would say that the security and the protection of the rights and liberties of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be enhanced and safeguarded by the simple fact that the Leader of the Opposition whoever he may be- whether it is the present Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  or the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs  (Mr Viner)  who is sitting at the table, or anyone of a host of prominent members of the Liberal Party- would be kept fully informed as of right within the terminology of the amendment moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would safeguard the rights and liberties of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> against any temptation by the Attorney-General of the day to use the very considerable processes within this legislation for bipartisan purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We reluctantly believe that many of these powers are necessary for a security organisation, but in giving those powers to a security organisation we need to have a system of checks and balances to ensure that the prerogatives of this Parliament and through those prerogatives the rights of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, are maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This very Government, this very AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Durack)-  these people who talk about our system- are creating an exception which could ultimately undermine in very serious ways the rights and liberties of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Hoover’s, whose views may be totally unacceptable generally in terms of the Australian community and who may, simply by the use of this clause and the freedom that it gives to a Director-General, be able, in a sense, to use his power against the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has consistently been the view of the Opposition that the best judge finally of what is in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is the Parliament, and that Ministers responsible to the Parliament can make that kind of judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People in working communities are going to fight the fight because they know that, essentially, deep down in the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, there is a sense of justice and fair play. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is in the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a willingness to support those who they recognise are treated unjustly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is their policy and that is what they are representing to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the present time that they will do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Gellibrand, his leader, the honourable member for Blaxland and the Adelaide conference of the Labor Party are asking the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to believe that the Labor Party, and it alone, has found the magic answer to the problem of the world’s scarcity in energy resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is saying to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that in this world of dwindling energy reserves it alone can give cheap energy, subsidised energy, at no cost to the consumer price index and at no cost to the speculative investment which is needed in this area to find alternative resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That kind of attitude, which is becoming increasingly prevalent and dominant within this Government, may provide some short term benefits for the Australian economy and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no better illustration of the long term value of this Government’s policies and the long term preservation of the living standards of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> than the willingness of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and people from abroad to invest in our country’s future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we want an Opposition that is provided with as much information as Ministers so that it can represent the alternative point of view to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This particular report was of great social and political importance not only to the Aborigines who were the subject matter of the inquiry but also to Aborigines throughout Australia who are entitled to proper treatment on the basis of the referendum result carried by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think it is true to say that historically the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, because of their attitude, have tended to regard the Aboriginal race as one which has not produced anything of cultural significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want to say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- I know that in their hearts, and voting intentions, they acknowledge it- that this Government is every bit as concerned about unemployment as the Opposition, and that to restore growth and to get unemployment down is the whole thrust and ultimate purpose of our policies- of our anti-inflation and cost containment policy and our industry policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must understand that because it is this that enables Australian industry to compete effectively with imports at low levels of assistance and to expand exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Very few houses are available for less than $35,000 to $40,000 in those two cities and that is where the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a right to know why health costs have risen to the level that they have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are paying a very high price in their health insurance premiums for the luxury of a Labor government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have suffered greatly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further to his statement regarding denial by the States of Federal Government jurisdiction or authority over Aboriginals despite the 1967 referendum  (Hansard,  House of Representatives Estimates Committee A, 26 September 1979, page 83), does the Federal Government propose to take any legislative or other action within the next 12 months to implement fully the expressed wishes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as shown in the 1967 referendum result; if so, what, action; if not; when will the Parliament be informed of any Federal action in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-47-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The discussions indicated how fortunate Australia is to have very extensive reserves of energy on which it can draw and from which it can derive extreme benefit if those energy reserves are properly managed and are put to use for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So there is this alternative to the pricing policies of the Government, to the fuel taxes which the Government has imposed on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At present, when we take into consideration the levy, the royalties and company tax, the return to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is in excess of 80 per cent on the cash flow available to the producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The case which I will present to the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> grieves not only me but also my constituents of Hunter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such inquiries in almost all cases would bring to the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, at least temporarily, the extent to which civil liberties and the rights of people to act freely and to practise freedom as they believe in it exists throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  and indeed the shadow Minister for Health, Or Klugman, have consistently tried to advise the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> not to insure themselves privately, particularly the young and single people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no argument whatsoever with the Opposition ‘s democratic responsibilities in advancing its own policy but I believe that I have a very real responsibility to warn the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that if Labor proceeds to re-introduce a Medibank-type arrangement it will return this country to the great health cost explosion which occurred when Labor was last in Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime, I hope that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will condemn the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Minister for Health for their attempts to create a politically expedient climate for the return of an extravagant Medibank scheme that they have now devised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not want and do not need the complex multiplicity of funds and tables which is currently thrust upon them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, particularly families and the poor, are crying out for a dependable, understandable, comprehensive system to take the worry out of health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I cannot understand about the Labor Party is that this was a failed policy; it was feared by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; it was rejected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the Government is very sensitive about this and is doing its best to deceive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as to what is really going on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The clear, undeniable facts show that attempts by Government spokesmen to portray the Government parties as generally low tax parties are nothing more than crude attempts to deceive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The real issue that is worrying the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is the death and destruction that has continued to take place in East Timor since the 1975 Indonesian invasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government of the day, on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, should be standing up to speak for the Timorese on the basis of their future and their right to survival. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very significant that while the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were in turmoil- the Government had been dismissed from office on 11 November and they were heading towards the December electionsmassive military aggression was being carried out by the Indonesians in East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would want us to say the very things this report says. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of grave concern to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as it should be, that any group of human beings anywhere in the world should be suffering deprivation and hunger at this time, whether in East Timor, Cambodia or Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point was made by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lionel Bowen)-  who I notice has not even bothered to stay in the House for the remainder of this debate although he put it on the agenda for todaythat it is believed that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are to be given every opportunity to demonstrate their concern for what has happened in Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no objection to that course being followed, but the issue concerning the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is the issue of merit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we do not proceed with a debate on this subject we are doing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a grave disservice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#debate-65">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What an extraordinary feature it is of a campaign report by the Liberal Party that one of the matters it has to explain to the members who serve in this Parliament, as well as to the other operatives in the Liberal Party throughout Australia, and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, is that the Government has not been self-indulgent, that there is a misunderstanding about some of the accusations that have been made against this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I believe that under our Federal system and our Constitution, where distinct lines of responsibility are drawn, the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can best be accommodated by the Commonwealth and the States and, indeed, local government authorities, all working together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly, to describe $13,000 in the name of a child as a modest investment shows a very strange set of values by the standards of most <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> could reasonably expect that the Opposition would have learnt something from this disaster, but obviously it has not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, it is incredible that not sufficient revenue was raised through the petrol taxes which the Fraser Government imposed on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the first Australian Federal Parliament was established in that city, the Founding Fathers thought, and rightly so, that there needed to be within the structure of the Federal Parliament a committee system which would not only give to the House the capacity at all times to oversee the activities of the Executive in the wider sense but, more specifically, be able to support in the House, through it, the work of the Auditor-General; and be able to guarantee that public funds were spent not only according to the wishes of Parliament but also in the most effective manner to benefit the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the substantial number of meetings that we hold and the fact that we table between five and seven reports in this Parliament every year, I think it is fair to say that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and this Parliament, have in every sense of the word received value for money from the activities which we have carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ten per cent or even SO per cent of the truth is as good a way of misleading this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a downright lie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is appalled at the fact that the Fraser Government took the approach to the 1976 census which it did, which was to take a sample of only 50 per cent of the population during the 1976 census, thereby wasting the time of 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in filling in the 1976 census forms and also, of course, making that census data much less reliable and useable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All it can think about is increasing the price of Australian produced crude oil in line with import parity, imposing massive tax increases on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and calling that an energy policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was one in which the Government was prepared to face up to its responsibilities on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to try to cut back on Government programs so that the tax scales would not be as high as they would be with the grandiose schemes of the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the result of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> electing our sort of government, because our sort of government knows the results of having a badly run economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, I put it to the House and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Australian economy is performing pretty strongly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> need to understand this in order to realise that, as in the period from 1973 to 1975, all of this would be at risk if the Labor Party were ever to get back into power and to implement the economic policy which it agreed upon a few months ago in Adelaide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assure the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Government has this key, but very complex and difficult, problem under continuous study and review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This industry is healthy enough to sustain a selective tax to increase the return to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these years little or no tax would be payable as large capital expenditures would be incurred, but in later years, once the major production costs have been written off, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would share in the benefits if profits proved to be exceptionally high, as has been the case with many developments in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The law and order party is again breaking the rules of Australian politics, of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and of ordinary standards of decency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope it will result in the housing aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> being more adequately fulfilled in the future than they ever have been in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister’s action sought to ensure that his point of view on a matter of very considerable public and political moment was understood by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>It is a matter on which the Government feels quite strongly that a point of view needs to be considered by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#debate-18">[More…]</a></li>
