<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Is it true that the overall objective is to endeavour to weaken the resolution of the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in their determination that the Communist directed North Vietnamese and Vietcong aggression should not be seen to succeed in South Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this a form of civil conscription of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by members of the medical profession designed to impose upon the people a medical service that is not approved by their elected representatives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Leader of the Government in the Senate in a position to be able to assure positively the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that Government policy with respect to the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam and the continuation of the National Service Act will not be affected in any way by the undemocratic mass disruptions proposed by the Vietnam Moratorium Campaign? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, its policy is in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Campaign which, I suggest, is not in the best interests of Australia because the Moratorium Campaign proposes to hold the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to ransom for 3 days to express a point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have seen a vigorous migration policy throughout the whole of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have only these 2 committees been asked to make the survey or has the Government taken some other action to ensure the safety of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister, as I have done previously, whether he would now nol agree that parliamentarians who are elected and entrusted with the responsibility of looking after the affairs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would command much greater respect and the confidence of those people if the whole of their income, including share holdings, were made available for public scrutiny - a practice which at present operates in many States throughout the United States of America and in Singapore under the Prime Minister,  Mr Lee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is so, does it not give an opportunity to  Senator Murphy  or other members of the Opposition to raise a point of order against any question that may be pertinent or embarrassing to the Opposition, and by doing this that honourable senator is then able to prevent the question from being broadcast to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister for Air advise Hie Senate whether the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will see flights of 4 Fill A aircraft next month? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, on behalf of the Opposition, I would like to say that the policies of this Government have been against the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Government has represented great interests whose policies are against the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in general. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710310_senate_27_s47/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people always will have some consolation in the fact that, whatever the deficiencies in the Government, the danger of the alternative government is much greater for Australia and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710310_senate_27_s47/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is taking proper steps, in the exercise of managing the business for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, to make quite sure that with heavy increases in costs and the declining growth in the number of travellers which has characterised the affairs of international airlines, it does not have adverse results in the coming year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710427_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> expect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will his Department conduct an inquiry into this matter and, if possible, ensure that only genuine migrants are accepted in the future so that Australia will not be giving holidays to many people at considerable expense to the Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators may rest assured that we will deal with the matter objectively and fairly in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be greatly assisted by the implementaton of some or all of the recommendations which have been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government assure the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that every avenue will be explored to obtain relay telecasts of these events to Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ls the Government aware that a large number of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are becoming worried about the amount of Government spending that has been promised since this Government came to office? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suspect that a great number of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will have become confused as to what actually happened and did not happen concerning the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in relation to this Croatian matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that it is in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have the committee established and brought into operation at an early date to consider the important question of prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is explained by the difference in their efficiency, and it is a tribute to the good sense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> which was displayed on 2nd December last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that these things are alive in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The friendship between the Indonesian and <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is well known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these are facts, why has the Minister interfered with the autonomy of the Board in order to thrust on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the types of programs that the Labor Party has decided that they should watch? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regarding the means test, the Government has undertaken to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that this will be eliminated over a period of 6 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Byrne  complained because he thought that I was suggesting that the position of the Queen depended upon the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the Budget is designed to implement the program which was put to and accepted by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all, it is a Budget which has indicated prosperity for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and which, when pursued, will lead to that prosperity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has accused the Government of not honouring election promises and of misleading the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday  Senator Lillico  in an effort to bolster his agrument in the debate on inflation deliberately and knowingly misled the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and he diliberately - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He asked firstly whether at some time in the next day or two I would give him an answer as to why the Government is helping a company to defraud the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To answer this question would be an admission that the Government is helping a company to defraud the people; it would be an admission that the Government is defrauding the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That excise was removed by this Government within a week of its taking office in December 1972 in accordance with its pre-election pledge to the wine industry and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill has 7 clauses and what would be put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is an acceptance of all 7 clauses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that way a determination will be made fairly inexpensively but in such a way as to be representative of the opinion of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The the continued run-down of the Australian defence force, the erosion of our defence capacity and the deliberate understatement of Australia’s vulnerability in a volatile world is detrimental to the long-term security and well-being of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-10-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That whereas our constitutional parliamentary democracy was clearly developed as a Federation to preserve for all time to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> their cherished right to live as free men and women, enjoying complete liberty of worship, assembly, speech, movement and the communication of knowledge and information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just want to say very briefly that this is an extremely sorry day for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, who must now deal with the product of economic mess and mismanagement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May it be taken that, by its action, this Government has firmly committed itself to a principle that was hitherto anathema to all Australian governments and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that is, that might is right in international affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s failure to inform the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and Parliament of a significant foreign policy decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When will this Government which promised the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> industrial stability and good government-union relations, act to stop this polarisation of government and the Australian worker? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I started out to say, I support my colleague  Senator Webster  in bringing this matter before the chamber tonight because I seriously believe that it is hypocritical of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to go over to the United Nations and talk about the situation in South Africa when we have not cleaned up our own backyard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the great aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is to preserve their jobs, and I suggest that  Senator Button  might devote himself to that exercise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter of soil conservation is of tremendous importance to Australia, which is still primarily an agricultural and pastoral country, and the purposes of the Bill are to see that we preserve this great natural asset of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not evident that such an act against humanity is now being perpetrated and that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Government should at least protest in an endeavour to save lives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of the fact that under new United States legislation, the Freedom of Information Act, citizens have the statutory right to see their Federal Bureau of Investigation file, whether or not they have been charged with a crime or are under suspicion, will the Minister for Police and Customs assure the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that such a right will be guaranteed in the legislation now being drafted for the Australian police force? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leave out all words after ‘That’, insert: this Bill be not further proceeded with until the Government agrees to submit itself to the judgment of the people, the Senate being of the opinion that the Prime Minister and his Government no longer have the trust and confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because of- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I present a petition from 10 citizens of Australia praying that the Senate introduce and pass a Bill to replace the Constitution with a new <span class="highlight">Australian People</span>’s Constitution, the details of which are contained in this petition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is remaining in office because it has a mandate from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are investigating, as we should properly investigate, whatever alternatives are available to us to ensure that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not hurt by the actions of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leave out all words after ‘That ‘, insert: this Bill be not further proceeded with until the Government agrees to submit itself to the judgment of the people, the Senate being of the opinion that the Prime Minister and his Government no longer have the trust and confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because of- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that the Prime Minister is constantly reminding the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that 1976 is the year of financial restraint, can the Minister inform the Senate of (a) the weekly cost of transferring the correspondence and (b) the weekly cost of the security system? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps the best thing that ought to be done is that I ask the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs whether he will make a quite deliberative statement in the Parliament so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> may be properly informed as to the true position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the fact that he is constantly reminding the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that 1976 is the year of financial restraint, will the Prime Minister inform the Parliament of (a) the weekly cost of transferral of correspondence and (b) the weekly cost of the security system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-57-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am prompted to say a few words at the Committee stage because of the provocative remarks made by  Senator Hall  in his fight with the Western <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who he said have been able to take unto themselves more money for road construction than the other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are all indebted to  Senator Lajovic  for his recording of the background history of Slovenia upon the approaching occasion of a significant anniversary and for bringing to the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the story of a people of very proud heritage and of great achievement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That would have been a good sermon in the days of the Whitlam Government when  Senator Wriedt  had the ability, if he had judged it wise, prudent and sensible for Australia to do so, to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It certainly is not in accordance with the wishes of the Commonwealth Police Officers Association and to the extent that it will militate against both the morale and the effectiveness of the new force, it is not in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When is the Government going to take the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into its confidence, at least to the same extent as President Nixon has taken his people into his confidence, and tell us in a plain and unambiguous way whether it wants to take Australian troops out of Vietnam and, if so, when those troops are going to be taken out? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700303_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has amazed me that nobody told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Americans were virtually equipping the Thai battalions holus bolus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He gave a categorical promise to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that he would not sign the Treaty until all those effective provisions were included in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Having made that promise to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the Government has proceeded to break it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Government opposed to the people of Australia showing, by peaceful demonstrations, their desire for a moratorium for an end to the war in Vietnam, which so many <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believe the Government should not have involved the nation in? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the rejection by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of many points of Government policy we now have this agitation seeking to revive the threat of Communism in Vietnam or somewhere else and criticism of the ALP because it is leading a peace demonstration or a moratorium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that Australians generally, as well as we in the Australian Labor Party, would be quite happy to see such a scheme introduced because we are anxious to see that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are properly looked after, irrespective of what political party forms the government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The huge profits which are now flowing to the Government from the scheme could be utilised in many ways to provide opportunities for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, 1 believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who enjoy full employment and a high standard of living, mainly through tariff protection of secondary industries must be prepared to share some of this prosperity with those who make it possible; that is, not only those who produce the primary industry export income but also the residents of country towns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As freight costs to the inland and northern areas of Australia constitute such a large proportion of the outgoings of these people I believe that a large scale sharing of the cost of freight by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally is one way of equalising the burden and would go a long way towards making it possible for producers and industries in the northern and inland areas to have an economic future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ought not our Government be trying to achieve peace in Vietnam instead of still trying to justify a position which, in the eyes of the world and in the eyes of the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, is completely unjustifiable? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This uplift will be brought about by the making of laws by this Parliament, as was desired by an overwhelming majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We used to pride ourselves that there was a fair distribution of wealth in Australia, that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and especially their children, would have a fair go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have become aware that there is a very real necessity for the preservation of their environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That not only is plumbing the depths of political irresponsibility but also is a betrayal of the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, particularly those whom the ALP purports to represent here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a function which in its discharge is receiving the approval of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and it will continue to receive it by the confirmation of the presence of our retiring senators in this place at the Senate election later this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is that the way members of the Australian Labor Party desire to put the conflict in Vietnam to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At that time and in that situation that view was not shared by the Government nor by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do this not only because I believe in it but because I believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to know as fully as national security can permit the reasons why we have put people into Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have nothing to hide from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and we believe that when the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know, and are given the means of knowing, what the Government is standing for, we will have their overwhelming support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Members of the DLP have come into this Parliament under a false banner, and I think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have reached the stage where they are satisfied that nothing which the members of the DLP have said or done during their period of trial here justifies their remaining in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> more and more will come to see the negative nature of the policy adopted by the Government over the years and will be ashamed that we had a government that led us into this war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the fact that South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are so badly served by the 2- airline policy, there being 2 aircraft leaving simultaneously direct for Sydney at 7.10 a.m. and 5.45 p.m. and only 3 regular daily flights to Melbourne, plus a few occasional irregular ones, and no direct flights between Adelaide and the national capital, while there are planes leaving every hour throughout the day between Melbourne and Sydney and frequent planes to Canberra from these cities, would the Minister consider licensing a third airline which would be willing to give good service to the less frequented air routes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is not within the scope of this legislation, but honourable senators may be assured that the Department of Civil Aviation is extremely active in the international field in doing what it can to make possible effective measures to lead to greater air safety and a greater use of air transport both in its own selfish interests on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and for the international community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can only assume that the Ministers themselves decided that they made no decisions of any great moment and, consequently, they did not feel they had anything worth reporting to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if it can be shown that a complete mistake had been made or that there had been an error of judgment, that would not necessarily prove that the Government, which is composed of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and which is elected by Australians, is out to smash the Aboriginal organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> themselves are looking for much more positive leadership in relation to this matter than they have had in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said, to me he was a sheet anchor because whenever problems concerning New Guinea were being discussed I found that to discuss them with Jim Fraser was to discuss them with a man who had had the advantage of being there, had made a very close and serious study of the area and liked the people there just as much as he liked his own <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700407_senate_27_s43/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I cannot say at this stage whether the Senate ought or ought not to undertake to guarantee funds through the parliamentary process that I have mentioned in order to keep Qantas in what is called the big league of international civil aviation, but I believe that these are proper questions to be addressed to me and to the Senate and, through us, to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the Minister that if she knew at that stage that a waiting period had been introduced - as she subsequently stated she did know when she answered me on 17th March - she had a responsibility to tell this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, notwithstanding the form of my question to which, apparently, she takes some exception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This trend towards an extended waiting period that has again developed with war service homes applications, and the Government’s cavalier couldn’t care less’ attitude, are deserving of condemnation by this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the Government undertook in 1967-68 to make available additional funds should the amount provided prove insufficient, we ask the Government likewise to give an undertaking to this Parliament, to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and particularly to those exservicemen whose applications have been deferred, that it will make a sum of money available immediately for the amelioration of their problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 could say quite definitely that no Government  speaker  would attend or would wish to attend a function at which people would be asked to disobey the law and would be encouraged to show a degree of force which is completely inconsistent with the character of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They do not want the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have the Chowilla Dam because they want a dam at Dartmouth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the Labor Party feels that it has a right, because it holds views strongly, to occupy the time of this Senate from time to time in expressing its views, I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to have the other view expressed in this place, even if we cannot get it put across in other places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The disruption of industry for brief periods here and there is nothing compared with the 400 <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who have died to save the hide of  Senator Rae  - and people like him of his age group - who could be there but who has not the moral courage to be there in any fighting unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Executive pays tribute to those in the community whose efforts are directed in a peaceful manner towards awakening conscience and stirring compassion in the minds and hearts, of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the tragic horror that is Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I, along with my colleagues, am proud lo bc associated with a Party that has the courage of its convictions to give leadership to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in such a proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that it has the overwhelming support of the great mass of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and despite what speakers on behalf of the Government have said this evening I say to them, using the words of the great poet Bracken: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to be able to say that the great mass of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> has now been convinced that a mere smear of anybody who opposes the Government, alleging that he is a Communist or a traitor, lacks any foundation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to say that I would be prepared to stand on the platform with any person who is opposed to this cruel, vicious and filthy war in Vietnam, no matter what political party he belonged to, and I would stand against anybody and regard him as the enemy of humanity and the enemy of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> if he supports the war in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my assessment, it was shortly after that episode that support for the Government started to fall away and I think the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> found themselves on the side of the Opposition in their opposition to the war in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude of the Labor Party in this chamber, in seeking by a constant barrage of interjections to deny me the right to speak, ought to make the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> alert and alive to the risks they would run if they should ever give power to members of the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Labor Party were not very concerned to fight the 1969 Federal election on this campaign, but it was an issue in that election and again the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, by a resounding majority, rejected the Labor Party’s view on this point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite obvious that last night  Senator Greenwood  was not able to get the support of honourable senators on his side of the chamber to launch a full scale debate on the subject, which those of us on this side of the chamber challenged the Government members to have here one Wednesday so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> could listen to a broadcast of the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will have this debate at any convenient time when the proceedings of this House are being broadcast, so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can hear it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what is more important is that the Australian Labor Party is prepared to debate this matter at a time when the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can hear what is being said rather than after the motion for the adjournment has been moved when they cannot hear the speeches made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700416_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will do exactly as we are doing here, namely, attempt to prevent the end of Chowilla and endeavour to obtain from the Federal Government agreement to an arrangement under which Chowilla will be built. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Commonwealth Government and the conjoined State governments, both today and in the past, in harnessing the waters of the Murray and associated streams and in the process of generating a greater volume of power have acted in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in a highly commendable way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would not think much of ourselves as a body of responsible parliamentarians if we did not have some regard to that sort of cost rise and to the wise use of the resources of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No government worthy of the respect of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can be expected to give recognition and to alter its decisions to accord with the decisions or the expressions of opinion of people in the streets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I again repeat to  Senator Murphy  that at the last 2 federal elections the policies which his Party espoused on this issue were not supported by the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and that is the time honoured practice by which policies in this country are determined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment seeks to defer ratification of some action that we cannot retrieve if once we make it, for the purpose of keeping us fully informed on the possibilities of solving the problem to the satisfaction of the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have been reminded very properly by  Senator McClelland  - I will refer to some of his comments later - the State of New South Wales to which I belong, the State of Victoria to which some of my colleagues belong and the State of South Australia joined with the Commonwealth in what has been a very useful and constructive exercise in joint responsibility by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is equally true to say that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> probably have more money in their savings bank accounts than Australians have ever had before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also true to say that there are available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> consumer goods the like of which are to be found in no other country and which are available at prices which are comparable with those applying in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>lt ought to be recognised that the Moratorium is a fraud on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because it is based on a lie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No government which is worthy of the respect of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> could submit to such tactics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite sure, as  Senator Little  said, that the ALP did not really mean what it said, but that is what is put in the ALP propaganda and rule books - undoubtedly to delude the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who may think the ALP does believe it - because 1 have absolutely no doubt that some members of the ALP are collaborating with members of the Communist Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only thing that  Senator Greenwood  is doing in trying to enhance his Government is to take the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and this Parliament away from what his Government is doing in the war in Indo-China, what it is doing in its whole foreign policy and the attitude it is taking to the dangers of the developing situation that we have in South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only thing that he has done because of his conduct in this matter has been to shift the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> away from the overall problem and to talk about a very narrow section. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was also rejected, and again to their eternal credit, by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What  Senator Greenwood  is doing now is putting forward again the objectionable clause in the Communist Party Dissolution Bill on which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> finally rallied and which they rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The history of Australia shows that if there is a war in which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are united behind its government, as they were in 2 world wars and in Korea, there has never been any shortage of volunteers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the points I have raised should be examined much more forcefully by this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> than they are being examined today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first proposition advanced by  Senator Greenwood  is that the objective of the Moratorium is to weaken the resolution of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to secure a just and lasting peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to every member of this Parliament: Your duty to the Australian forces and to Australian security demands that any judgment that is to be made upon this conflict be made here by the elected members of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and not by mass, mob movements that may be promoted in cities for the purpose of dislocating our ordinary national life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We support the Moratorium Campaign because we believe that what is happening in Vietnam and Cambodia is - whatever else it may be doing in those countries - poisoning the entire life of the American and <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told this by a government which at the very same time boasted of the amount of trade which it had with China, the very country which it claimed to be defending the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because of matters such as these that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> intend to protest as part of the Moratorium movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will take the same kind of action to see that the Government and the rest of the people- know that they are just as opposed to what is a brutal and unjust war as are the people of the United Stales and the people of other countries who have made similar protests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Weaken the resolution of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to secure a just and lasting peace in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia has a great deal to be proud of in the work that has been done in Cambodia by <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are good enough and proud enough to go there and do a job for this country and we should not let them down by the kind of behaviour that we are seeing demonstrated in Australia and proposed to us here today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Moratorium supporters are really proposing to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what / would call a ‘popular front’ method of attracting attention to their cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that by participation in such peaceful bodies as the Vietnam Moratorium Campaign and other peaceful camaigns that have been planned we can give a lead to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a very good statement and I have read it for the particular reason of informing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of just what the position is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I again draw attention to the terms, lt is stated in the first instance that the Moratorium is designed to weaken the resolution of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; secondly, that it is designed to give moral support to North Vietnam; thirdly, that it is designed to promote disorder; and, fourthly, that it is designed to cause unwarranted inconvenience to Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>T commend, so far as it is necessary to do so, the Government’s step in providing these additional benefits under the Homes Savings Grant Act, but I suggest that they do not by any means meet the case, lt seems to me that the Bill will not confer any great measure of benefit on those people who are in such need in the Australian community, and 1 should hope to hear from the Minister that something is in contemplation at the present time to meet the very urgent need of those people in the community for whom 1 and, I believe, the bulk of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have great concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure it has completely bewildered hundreds of thousands - the vast majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - who find such action completely incompatible with their sense of the rightness of things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know where the loyalties of the great mass of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> lie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Moratorium was a demonstration by a large group of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, not just members of the Communist Party or a small percentage of people who support the Vietcong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If any lesson is to be learnt from the Moratorium, surely it is that a large body of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are now most concerned about this matter and intend to take peaceful measures to persuade the Government to change its orientation and its fixation on military solutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and the propaganda machine has been directed at the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> through our own news media. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand one will see unanimity amongst practically the whole of the Australian Press which gives people a one-sided, biased line which, in my view, is biased for the purpose of keeping the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> under a cloud and ill-informed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The good sense and loyalty of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will make them say: ‘They are our boys over there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I only hope that the leaders of this Government, instead of sitting back and taking a defensive attitude, will take more of the offensive in this political fight and show the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that what is being done is the right thing for the preservation of liberty and democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Old  argument about ‘my country right or wrong’ carried some weight with the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>  and  that those who were opposed to the war were accused of sabotaging in some way the war effort, of stabbing our boys in the back, and we were losing some votes at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that, just as in the United States of America at this time, the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are opposed lo Australia’s participation in the Vietnam war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have shown that they are opposed to Australia’s participation in the Vietnam war by the greatest series of political demonstrations which have been seen in this country for decades and which took place over the past few days in support of the cessation of Australia’s participation in the Vietnam war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My attitude  to  the war in Vietnam is that whales er happens inside Vietnam is a matter for settlement by the Vietnamese people and that what is happening in Indo-China is no business of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the Australian Army or the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Sena:or WHEELDON- If  Senator Young  wishes to say that a majority of members of the United States Senate are traitors and subversives, he is entirely at liberty to do so but 1 do not think this statement would be taken seriously by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the fact is that hundreds of thousands of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were not intimidated by persons like  Senator Greenwood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has been estimated by the Press that in the States where the demonstrations were held against our involvement in the war in Vietnam over 100,000 <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> participated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have a little more faith in the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who elected them to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After what happened on 7 th May, if the Australian Labor Party has not dug its grave so far as any chance of winning an election in this country in the near future is concerned then there is something wrong with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does he not consider that, in view of the visit of the Prime Minister of Canada, this would be one tangible way of building up greater contact between the Canadian people and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700519_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have the Opposition in the Senate to thank for bringing out into the open arena of public debate the grave shortcomings of the existing national health scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was said that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were really getting value for their money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an Opposition member of that Committee, I pay her and my fellow members of that Committee a compliment for having done a very effective job on behalf of the Senate and on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> need a scheme which meets the requirements of the entire community regardless of age and income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say also that when a Labor government is elected the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will receive a truly national health scheme which will provide economically and equitably hospital services for all, and that the scheme will be financed by graduated contributions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very easy to claim that the scheme which the Labor Party put forwardin its amendment, which it suggests should be adopted, will meet all the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at low cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When schemes of this nature are introduced the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are divided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, of course, this scheme was conceived in panic when it was put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> during the election campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in his last policy speech, amongst other things: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are vulnerable to disease because they have not been exposed to massive outbreaks of such diseases as cholera, small-pox and the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the sort of scheme that the Government wants to force the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to join in order that they may receive the Commonwealth benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Have only these 2 committees been asked to makethe survey or has the Government taken some other action to ensure the safely of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We believe that the names and qualifications of the members of the Committee should be made available to the Australian Parliament and thus to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that it is in the interest of the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the names and qualifications of those persons who are appointed under section 101 of the Act, to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, should be made public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that as representatives of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, we anil the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to know the names and qualifications of the members of the Committee Therefore, we seek specifically to write into the Act that Parliament shall be advised Of the names and qualifications of the persons appointed under the provisions of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They assert that it should be the right of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to obtain a similar benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are of the opinion that, having regard to the service they perform on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and having regard to the good will that exists between the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and them, they will be able to meet healthily any competition that might come their way in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position becomes alarming when one goes deeper and finds that Hamersley itself is 54% owned by Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd, 36% by Kaiser Steel and 10% by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They can still share in the development of this country provided that they recognise that they have an obligation to allow Australians to play a part because, after all, in the first instance the bauxite, the coal and the uranium, etc., belong to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the investors have been privileged at little or no cost to develop, exploit, produce and sell our resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whenever the election is, I am confident that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will elect an Australian Labor Party government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>we are told constantly that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a 50% interest in the Bass Strait oil and gas fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one examines the Australian holding in Bass Strait one finds that the approximate interest of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> through the BHP shareholding is 35% and not 50%. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not a very pretty picture for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to look at. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know what he is getting for it but the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not getting very much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I believe that the article to which I am about to refer may reveal why the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are a little reluctant to invest in this project, lt says: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The story has been falsely spread all over Australia that Australians would not invest in the risk industry of iron ore. 1 wonder what chance the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were given to invest in this industry and what was the extent of the risk money required to be invested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>CRA to give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> an equity shareholding in this industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eventually, the joint venture agreed to give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a 10% shareholding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ten million shares were sold to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for $25m, which represents $2.50 a share. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we find that, in relation to this huge asset which the Government has given away, for S25m the Kaiser Steel Corporation and CRA will retain a 90% interest and for $25m the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will have a 10% interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this the sort of joint venture and the sort of Australian equity that the Government is satisfied for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It wanted to exploit its discovery, and it was given permission by the then Treasurer,  Mr William  McMahon, and the Reserve Bank of Australia to go to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for a $30m debenture issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that its basis is to retain as much as possible of Australian industry and development in the hands of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is to the credit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that now for the first time in our history they have really invested money in mining organisations to the degree which is necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is essential that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> invest as much as possible but there is a limitation to what they can do and a lack of, shall I say, permanency in the minds of a lot of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about investment in mining corporations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, probably because of their newness in this kind of thing, very often in this field and often in business look for very quick returns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, how many of us in the Senate, would be prepared to say: ‘We will invest our money for 20 years and in 20 years we will be paid a dividend’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have to learn about investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned earlier in my speech, never before have the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> really invested in mining and oil development to the extent to which they have now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw then very clearly the attitude of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by tradition, general acceptance of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and experience were different in their approach from contemporary senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the purposes of my moving this motion is to bring before the Senate and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the crisis which is developing in the Australian aircraft industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attention is drawn to the fact that many <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who have had this kind of involvement and experience all too often have had to leave Australia and pursue their chosen careers abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is in our interests that those people should be given not only an accurate account of Australian life but also a continuously maintained view of Australia, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and, most importantly, Australia’s intentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700605_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Establishing quality, producing films of a commercial export potential and producing an industry which will truly reflect the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and their characteristics, this year we are giving a long delayed opportunity of taking this industry under the nurture of Government encouragement and cultivation with all theagencies of government for the interests of tourism, trade and our culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe that it is in the interests of the Australian film industry, the Australian nation and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> thai this Film Development Corporation be guided by experts and not by people who may be seeking some sort of backwater for their retirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Federal Government feel that it has a responsibility for certain health aspects of the Australian public or is the protection of the health of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a matter for Slate jurisdiction? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been my view that as Australia develops and there is an increasing independence of this country the problems it faces are increasing, and there has to be a chamber of Parliament in which the long term interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and their sentiments, hopes, aspirations and long term needs reside in the minds of its members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of us here today have a lot to be grateful for that our forebears in this institution have made it possible for it to become like it is, and I hope we will always be able to develop the Senate to be a really useful servant of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and, in particular, to consider their long term interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should be understood that this was requested by the Queensland Government and is an example, one might say again, of the Commonwealth and the States working together in a joint enterprise for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, particularly the people of the region and of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I do submit that if the Commonwealth is to provide money for the provision of libraries in high schools in the various States a responsibility rests with the Commonwealth to see that those libraries are being put to proper purpose and that they are being used in order to educate and equip people to take part in the great controversies and the great issues which are confronting the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is expected and hoped for in this country is that we will use our strength acquired through earlier years to do the things that ought to be done for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 suggest to this Government and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that those difficulties will only and can only be overcome by the election of a Labor government which is pledged to establish in Australia and for Australia a national water resources development authority to plan and to co-ordinate the development of surface and sub-surface water resources throughout Australia on a Federal, a State and a regional level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that in due course when these facts are made known, as they will be made known, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will reveal with a clarity which they are able to do on occasions that what they expect of this Parliament is responsibility and not political opportunism of the kind we have seen from the Opposition parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-64-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Anyone who considers handing out moneys from the public purse to support industries that require a basic examination and real solutions to their problems is just kidding himself and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall to mind that in the time of Chifly or Curtin - I forget which - a question concerning power to implement price control was placed before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and they very substantially rejected the proposition to vest the necessary power in the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My reply to the Leader of the Government is that if we do not refer to these committees vital subjects in which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are very much concerned and by which they are vitally affected the standing committees will merely wither on the vine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a matter which comes within the ambit of fire, flood and drought and surely should be the subject of scrutiny by a standing committee of the Senate in view of the amount of money being made available by the Commonwealth - by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - for this specific purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore move: at end of motion add -  and the  Senate  condemns this deceptive and negative Budget because it fails to meet the real needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, especially with respect to (a) standards of social service and war pensioners, (b) assistance to schools, hospital and urban authorities and (c) restructuring of stricken primary industries and because it introduces and increases taxes and charges of a regressive and inequitable nature’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet another is to furnish the best possible circumstance for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to maintain environmental and educational opportunities which will enable the nation to grow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore say that the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Snedden)  spoke very truly when he observed that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had triumphed over irresponsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the opportunity, above all, for the Opposition to show to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it can present a budget which will provide opportunity, on the one hand, and security on the other hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are uncertain as to who is replying - and I am sure that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> might be uncertain as to who is responding to the Budget, then we may well be uncertain who might be the alternative government, and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> may well be uncertain who might frame an alternative Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then tremendous pressure began to be exerted on the Government, because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are just about sick of Prime Ministers going before them, making promises and then hedging on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If honourable senators opposite are democrats they will accept our challenge, grasp the nettle and go to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> whom they are supposed to represent and whom we are supposed to represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But it has to balance with this other factors in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700827_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever the Opposition may say regarding  Mr Hawke’s  call for a strike or protest recently, he did not receive good support from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate condemns this deceptive and negative Budget because it fails to meet the real needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, especially with respect to (a) standards of social service and war pensioners, (b) assistance to schools, hospital and urban authorities and (c) restructuring of stricken primary industries and because it introduces and increases taxes and charges of a regressive and inequitable nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say that the Government has not made good - it certainly has not more than made good - its promise to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it would substantially reduce the taxation burden on the lower and middle income groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not wish to bring controversy into this situation but I must say that I believe the Government has been less than frank with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about its intentions to phase our forces out of the Vietnam war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At end of motion adil “, and the Senate condemns this deceptive and negative Budget because it fails to meet the real needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, especially with respect to (a) standards of social service and war pensioners, (b) assistance to schools, hospital and urban authorities and (c) restructuring of stricken primary industries, and because it introduces and increases taxes and charges of a regressive and inequitable nature”. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see glib words set out in a number of pamphlets, programmes, ministerial statements and what have you, but 1 claim - and I believe that a lot of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would adhere to this view - that many of the details relating to the expenditures have been effectively smothered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If ever a document that highlights to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the incompetence of this Government and its inability to face up to the very great and growing problems besetting this nation was presented to the Australian Parliament, it is the Federal Budget which was presented recently by the Federal Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Bury). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is scandalous that our mutton exports to the United States and Canada have had to be stopped to highlight to this Parliament and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the grave shortage in <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason, I say that it deserves the condemnation of this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that they all come back to the contribution made by governments prepared to assist in the encouragement of individual effort, with the backbone of preparedness on the part of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to work hard and to achieve for themselves those things that are for them possible of achievement in a political climate properly provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, it will make the lot of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> much more difficult than it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will be proved in the very near future when the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have to make up their minds as to which Party they support at the forthcoming Senate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, on the other hand, as the newspaper said, the mass of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> demand endless benefits and they seem unaware that the taxpayer must pay for everything. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The tide is flowing against the Government and these acts are the acts of a desperate government which is trying to justify a policy which more and more is being rejected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One by one this Government is breaking down the liberties of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and it keeps telling them: Do not get upset about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From now on, as far as 1. am concerned, whenever the Government indulges in this kind of repressive conduct which is aimed not only at those who seek to enter Australia but also at the liberties of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and their right to hear opinions of all kinds, then I will raise the matter in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One thing which we have to determine in our minds, and which cannot be excluded from the problem which is engaging the attention of a substantial number of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, is the so-called Vietnam Moratorium Campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because this is of vital importance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, particularly those living in the metropolitan area of Sydney and those who are engaged professionally in the Australian television industry, I urge the Minister to investigate the situation closely and as a matter of urgency to see whether the information which has been accorded me is correct, and to refer the matter to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board for further investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1969-70 we borrowed only $138m from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as against $568m in 1967-68, passing therefore to a net Australian position of only $7m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What steps have been taken to enable these Cambodian politicians to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, via the media of radio and television, of the tragedies and loss of life that have befallen Cambodia since it was mercilessly invaded by North Vietnamese forces? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not fall .for that sort of trick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believed that if various industries which were already bedevilled could not show themselves or the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the way out they obviously would be asking for Government assistance and the merrygoround would be started again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All that has happened in relation to this matter is that the Minister for Trade and Industry  (Mr McEwen)  has gone overseas and spent thousands of dollars of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s money during the winter recess and come back to Australia and said: ‘Things could not be gloomier’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accordingly, I think that the Bill is a useful one from the point of view of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - both as Australians in their own investing right and as those who wish to borrow overseas to help their country’s development programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> elected 2 members of the Democratic Labor Party to the Senate almost 6 years ago and 2 further members almost 3 years ago, making the number 4 and giving it a decisive mathematical position in the Senate, that we come here very conscious of the trust that has been reposed in us by the Australian nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When  Senator Gair  goes to the electors in a few weeks time, one thing he will be able to go on, backed by his Party, will be that this solemn trust which has been reposed in him and in his Party by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> has not been misplaced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It likes to pull the wool over the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by selling them the story that we are under threat of invasion - although from where I do not know because the Government has never said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are now giving the Government an opportunity to carry out what was implicit in the Prime Minister’s promise in the first place; that is, when concessions are given to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the burden should be borne by those people with the broadest backs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Briefly, some of the facts of the situation as it confronts the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in this year 1970-71 might bear recapitulating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the purpose of what we are talking about, in this period of 21 years the expenditure of the Commonwealth Government on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for a variety of reasons has become 7 times greater. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This demonstrates how the burden of taxation in order to raise revenue to spend for various essential reasons for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> has shifted through the years from indirect taxation to direct taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>lt still is a revenue producing exercise to cover expenditure that is being made on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>J think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are becoming quite proud today of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will realise that that typifies the Austraiian Labor Party attitude, not only with respect to land rents in Canberra but also with respect to most of the issues of this day and age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is so, and they will deny it again because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not want Socialist control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will recall that Prime Minister Menzies sacked the present Treasurer  (Mr Bury)  for having the temerity to open his mouth to warn the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of what might be the consequences of Britain’s entry into the European Common Market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I. think a person has a legitimate grievance and if the Minister is not prepared to listen to it I will raise in the Senate during the debate on the motion for the adjournment of the Senate each matter concerning the department that is brought to my attention in order to highlight the matters to the Parliament and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>According to an answer that was given to me by the Minister on 19th June, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> owe home loans totalling about $3,744,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We hope that much more can be done, not only in the provision of housing finance but in all directions in the housing field by the Federal and State governments to protect the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and particularly the man on the low income who is saving desperately to provide a roof over his family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not oppose the Bill but we point out the inadequacies of the higgledy-piggledy haphazard existing arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States, as a result of which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are paying the piper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>believe that this is not the spirit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at all, irrespective of whether honourable senators in this chamber are influenced by racial discriminations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only does it do their own Party - the Party to which they belong and in whose name they stand - a discredit but also it is a discredit to Australia that they should urge these views, which they must appreciate are untrue, upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will need to be known to this Government, the Commonwealth Parliament, the State parliaments, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and in particular those people who are working in education precisely what the position is at the present time with regard to the adequacy of teaching staffs, the training of teaching staffs and the facilities such as buildings and equipment for the education of students at present attending institutions of learning in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I raise strong objection to the manner in which the Government gagged these debates because it was done at considerable expense to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result of that referendum, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> gave this Parliament and the Commonwealth Government the right to carry out certain drastic reforms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But on a matter which is arousing such controversy and such interest amongst the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and something which is of such tremendous importance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as the future of advanced education, it is the view of the Opposition that the body which deliberates on these matters should have a standing beyond the rather ephemeral standing which is given to it in the terms of the Minister’s second reading speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am reading that part of the debate in which he moved an amendment catling for the addition to the motion of the words and the Senate condemns this deceptive and negative Budget because it fails to meet the real needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, especially with respect to (a) standards of social service and war pensioners, (b) assistance to schools, hospitals and urban authorities’ etc., etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-97-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for External Territories  (Mr Barnes)  and his predecessor, the present GovernorGeneral,  Sir Paul  Hasluck, as Ministers have discharged an obligation which I think has redounded to their credit and which should be recognised by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  has properly, fairly and sensibly reported to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have thought, that a Labor party, purporting to speak for some part of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, would think that it should join in the exercise of controlling inflation rather than condemn the attempt to bring about some control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  <li>
    <p>The proposition put forward by the Minister for Air that the Australian Wool Industry Conference is superior to the Senate would not be accepted by 5 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>-, yet the Minister made that a defence of his policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The honourable senator asked the same question last time and I told him that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and particularly the Australian wool growers have a very deep and abiding interest in their industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The object of the ban was to create a monopoly for Australia in fine wools, the argument being that if there was a shortage of fine wools the price would go up and the Australian wool producer and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally would get a higher return. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The sooner that we in this and the other place recognise this, the sooner we will receive the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Parliament must assert its responsibilities and obligations to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> I ask the Minister whether section 28 (3.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The General Manager of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, having regard to the functions of the Commission as set out in the Act, has enormous responsibilities to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, lt could well be that a fair amount of his time may be taken up in putting his signature to the appointment of a number of people who are appointed each year to the staff of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This might involve a considerable amount of administrative and clerical work on the part of the General Manager, when his time could be better spent in administering the huge responsibility that he has to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate is here to  function  effectively on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and the committee system will enable it to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Also under the Bill it is intended to have courses designed to impart an understanding of the rights and duties of an Australian citizen and of the way of living of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think anyone could tell me how to explain to a migrant what happened in the other House this afternoon and how that is part of the course of living of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those latter two gentlemen drew attention to a number of difficulties facing this industry which, as I have said, in the ordinary conception of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is totally free from problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Queensland, the State of New South Wales and the Commonwealth, the national crop is acquired and then a price is determined which shall be the home consumption price at various rates and on various terms and conditions on which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> shall pay for their sugar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally speaking, I do not think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believe that in the context it is an unduly high price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am satisfied that, whatever the resentments or misunderstandings may have been years ago, today the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> accept it as a fact of Australian life that, without any undue profiteering, the domestic price paid for sugar today is a not unfair and not unreasonable price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention this because this Bill asks the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to accept an additional burden of cost for producing Australian sugar at above world prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it is only just that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should know the condition of this industry as justification for the maintenance of this supported price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that, in making that appeal to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, this industry will not be disappointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> recognise that it is a worthwhile industry, it is not an industry that is exploiting the consumer, it is merely receiving the support necessary to maintain its viability and in the light of uncertain world demand this is the only solution for continuing a proper economic level within the sugar production industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The speakers put the position fairly before the Minister and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as I am attempting to do tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We seek to protect the market share of Qantas, which is owned by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the outset I point out how important it is, in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that there be an effective watch dog over the Executive and the bureaucracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In comparison, let us think of the scant number of committees that it is suggested should be set up to advise the Parliament in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think much more could be done to improve the system, bearing in mind the paramount importance of the responsibility placed on members of this Parliament by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the proposal that has been put forward on the notice paper because I believe that, the Committee system is in the interests of the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and that it should be encouraged to ensure the preservation of parliamentary democracy in this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>to fight in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, including primary producers and exporters, in an attempt to keep these rates at the lowest possible level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has been a participation of which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will bc ashamed forever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are against this war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that I am being fair when I say that the Opposition is suggesting that as a matter of policy the first draw on the Commonwealth pool should be for wages as decided by the Arbitration Commission and that the second draw, or co-equal draw with the first from the common pool, should be for pensions which have been adjusted to the average earnings of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, which amount would be fixed by the Arbitration Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In looking at any total programme to meet the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and acknowledging, of course, that it is the nation’s very high responsibility and obligation to care for its senior citizens and its needy people, one must agree that pensioners and the aged arc not perhaps the only needy ones in the community today - not the only areas of very great need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having taken an interest in politics in this country for about 55 years, I am of the opinion that the greatest disaster which befell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> was as a result pf the prices referendum in 1948. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710407_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if the Government cannot find it in its heart to support this motion, at least if the Opposition and perhaps  Senator Turnbull  support it we would represent the majority of thought of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and surely a government must have some regard for that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the position in which so many <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> find themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Council does a great job for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, particularly in the country where water is so extremely important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it extraordinary that the Government which at present conscripts young Australians to fight in Vietnam in a war that is no business whatsoever of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and which engages in the butchery in Vietnam, has the audacity to say that China does not live up to our high standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a lot of confusion in the minds of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about industrial action that may be taken in respect of the airlines of Australia, both domestic and overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is time that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> insisted upon some form of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the title of that Bill we met with opprobrium for quite a few months, until finally we got the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to agree with us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The late  Dr Evatt,  then Attorney-General, was charged on behalf of the Labor Government to produce legislation to stop what the Labor Government reasonably apprehended to be disruption of a major project which was being conducted in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Journalists who for a long time have been writing about drug abuse may have been given a little hope from our public meetings that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be made aware of the extent of the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government feels that this is a Bill from which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will derive much benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do not think that any one of us would not hold the view that transport and the increased efficiency of the transport system are matters of vital importance to all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, irrespective of where they live, because they are <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> before they are South Australians or New South Welshmen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Qantas is owned by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, surely the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are served by making sure that Qantas is kept going effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Qantas now has an investment of about $260m in total assets and of that amount the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have put in about $40m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am trying to see to it that Qantas gets the best opportunity for business, because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> own Qantas; that so far as possible it operates on a reasonable pricefare arrangement, which it seeks to do; that it investigates new opportunities, which it is doing; and that it endeavours to keep its business economically viable and operating, which it is doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  cannot go beyond that at present, but  I  assure the honourable senator that any new idea, scheme or proposal that anybody in the Qantas scene has to improve its business for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, who own the airline, for the fare paying passengers and for the operations ofthe company, will always have my wannest support and my close attention, and when such schemes, ideas or proposals come up  I  devote myself to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have hoped that by this time the Minister for Civil Aviation would have made to the Parliament and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a ministerial statement on the financial situation confronting Qantas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because Qantas is Australia’s international airline, because it is so vital to this nation and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and because we are led to believe that it is in some financial difficulty, we believe that it is the responsibility of the Government to lay the cards on the table and to tell the Australian Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the exact situation so far as this great international image for Australia is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> still have the highest regard, properly and correctly based, for the national airline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Qantas enterprise, which is owned by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, has had from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in cash $39m, or 16 per cent of its total assets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally, all of us have a great interest in this matter because Qantas is an airline Owned by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is as it should be because, after all, this Parliament serves Australia and the people of Australia and as long as we remember that I feel that the destiny of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will always be safe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to go over that because I think it is pretty well known to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that that sums up the position fairly well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decisions made here are of great consequence for all the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any attempt to change that situation would be rebuffed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are the masters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the debate on the Budget for the last financial year - that is 1969-70  -  I referred to its grave shortcomings in such crucial areas to the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as health, education, public works and services and national development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of all these considerations, on behalf of the Opposition I moved an amendment to the Budget which said:  the Senate condemns this deceptive and negative Budget because it fails to meet ‘.he real needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, especially with respect to (a) standards of social service and war pensioners, (b) assistance to schools, hospitals and urban authorities and (c) restructuring of stricken primary industries and because it introduces and increases taxes and charges of a regressive and inequitable nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it makes extravagant assertions like  Senator Murphy  made when he said that there are a substantial number of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who have not enough to eat, then it appears to me that this is its right, though I suppose a number of people would doubt the basis upon which the honourable senator made that assertion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as that has been a responsible decision made upon the merits of the legislation this Government is satisfied that it has the support of a not insignificant section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of honourable senators to the Hansard report of 26th August  1970  which shows that  Senator Murphy  moved the following motion: at end of motion add -  and the Senate condemns this deceptive and negative Budget because it fails to meet the real needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, especially with respect to (a) standards of social service and war pensioners, (b) assistance to schools, hospitals and urban authorities and (c) restructuring of stricken primary industries and because it introduces and increases taxes and charges of a regressive and inequitable nature.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It ought to be perfectly clear to everybody that we have a very strong interest in protecting the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s flag carrier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a build up for a good deal made by the former Prime Minister- an increase of 76c over the basic price of indigenous crude oilEven supposing that the Minister and his advisers are correct in making the assumption that this will be the price of oil in 1975 how much more important does it become that Australian crude oil be not exported and that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> be allowed to take advantage of the fact that a fortuitous deal has been made between the Government and Esso-BHP? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This last addition happily, perhaps because of the activities of the Australian Democratic Labor Party and the firm belief of this Party in the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian family, is at present removed from the statutes of both the States and the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second consideration which has played a part in this withdrawal has been the resistance of many hundreds of thousands of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> against the participation of our troops in Vietnam and the resistance of many millions of American people against the continuation of the presence of American troops in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Like the honourable senator 1 am anxious to develop the business fully but in doing so I have to have regard to the interests of Qantas which is owned by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and one would want it to continue to be so and to be successful I also have to have regard to the total tourist situation, to the encouraging of more people to come to Australia and to the increasing of opportunities for people to travel at cheaper rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government is going to increase the liquidity of wealthy people but do nothing to control prices, it is dishonest to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me reduce it to this concept: It concerns the raising
          and spending of, for every one of the 12,800,000 <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, a sum of $695; or,
          for a family of 5 - a man, his wife and 3 children - an impressive sum of $3,500. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether anyone in this House knows that, contrary to the propaganda being
          preached today, the true ownership of industry in this country is becoming increasingly
          that of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are weary of the struggle against rampant inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, in our country, the truth is that neither Parliament nor the
          <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been told the truth about the problems facing our nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have, on
          repeated occasions, put before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> proposals to remove the injustices

          government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will continue to put those proposals to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and we
          will implement them at the first opportunity in order to bring justice, both social and
          economic, to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, it is up to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to make the

    <p>The economic affairs of a country in a remote part of the world can have a profound influence on the welfare of a great number of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we do not take heed of that proposition then I believe we are asking for trouble from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 simply say that it is transparently obvious to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that in this country there is an inflationary situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1929 the financial agreement reached by the Commonwealth and the States and approved by referendum of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> limited the ability of the States to raise money in one of the 2 major ways in which State governments and all governments have raised money in times past, namely, by loans and borrowings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it did not enable the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to know what is involved in any Labour Party proposal to balance those functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is of credit not only to the Australian Government but also to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that social service benefits at this level should be granted to those in the community who require them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time of the last Senate election, the former Prime Minister the Right Honourable John Gorton made a speech to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in which he stated that child minding centres would be established throughout the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as I have been reading and listening to certain things which have been reported in the Press and said by people in other places, it has occurred to me that in the interests of all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and of the Parliament, who between them are responsible for the ownership of Qantas, something might well be said carefully and thoroughly to establish the truth of the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister further inform the Parliament why obsolete ex-RAAF planes are sold at bargain prices when the firms buying such planes in job lots are able to make enormous profits at the expense of the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think they represent the viewpoint of a majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>State and Federal portfolios are held by Ministers who are interested in bringing to the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a greater awareness of this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>That the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> both in Metro politan and Rural areas should have the best of television programmes available to them and that television as a powerful means of communication should not be in the control of too few hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He goes on to say that if they did not retain a capacity for versatile and effective performance in the face of totally unexpected challenges, and a well educated high command capable of foreseeing and responding to the challenges which may face it in a predictably unstable international world scene, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> may one day have cause to regret bitterly their reluctance to keep up with their insurance premiums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously it was not good politics to have too many draftees being killed in Vietnam, but obviously it was necessary to build up the army if the Government was already undertaking commitments, about which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were told nothing, to send more troops to Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having introduced conscription because of an unacknowledged intention to get more deeply involved in Vietnam, without admitting it to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, this Government cannot now admit that the end of our commitment in Vietnam ends the need for conscription. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As all honourable senators know, we have a great interest in Qantas becoming increasingly involved in the charter field and in endeavouring to see that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and others, can travel at lower cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government, acting in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, said: ‘This is contrary to the Austraiian way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the Government’s actions is of interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He sent the then Minister for Air to America to buy up big in order to fool the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into thinking that we would be getting an aeroplane with which to equip the Air Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It would not be improper for me to say that the Government ought to have a double dissolution right now and see where the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would put it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is the sort of policy that Menzies brought in, knowing that it would be unpopular, knowing that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would not accept conscription for overseas service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the Australian Press has not yet been so perceiving as to think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be reminded suitably of such a pregnant statement as that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But if they do not retain a capacity for versatile and effective performance in the face of totally unexpected challenges, and a well educated high command capable of foreseeing and responding to the challenges which may face it in a predictably unstable international world scene, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> may one day have cause 10 regret bitterly their reluctance to keep up with their insurance premiums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder at the temerity of the Australian Labor Party in seeking to delude the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by coming forward with an amendment of this character because it makes a mockery of the whole concept of national service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a brand on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and it ought to be nailed as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the continuing urgent need in this situation, will the Government give consideration to encouraging the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to accept greater responsibility to supplement the Government’s contribution by allowing gifts to this fund to be deductions for income tax purposes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711012_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, I think that one might well say that there are quite a few areas in Australia where bipartisan policies can be said in the broad to encompass the general interest of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is of the opinion that it is not possible to make an increase in the donation because of the economic depression now being experienced in Australia, will the Minister take the necessary action to set up the machinery for an appeal to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in an endeavour to raise at least $10m for this very worthy cause? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased that at long last, after a period of 9 or 10 months, the Minister has condescended to give Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a detailed report on the collision that occurred at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport on 29th January 1971 between a Trans-Australia Airlines aircraft bound for Perth and a Canadian Pacific Airlines aircraft coming in from Honolulu and Nandi. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having set out the details of the collision I was about to go on to say that 1 had deliberately used the word ‘condescended’ because it appears to me that a deliberate attempt has been made by the Minister and his department to keep this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the dark for a long period as to the serious consequences that could have arisen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly, 1 am concerned to see the Minister and his Department providing this Parliament with the scantiest of information on a matter which is of paramount importance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and particularly the people of Sydney, when obviously fuller and more complete details were available to the Department and should have been available to the Minister when the reply of 26th August was given to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rather remarkable that such an important announcement, telling the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that Australian conscripts and Australian regular forces will no longer be sent to Vietnam, should receive such cavalier treatment from the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the point of view of the Government and of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, it is a great pity that this report seems to have been pigeonholed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Health is of vital concern to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, lt cannot be allowed to be dealt with lightly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All aspects of the subject must be given close and detailed consideration by the Parliament not only because the health of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at all times must be and must remain paramount but also because of the ever-increasing costs with which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> appear to be faced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>There is no desire on the part of this Government to curb the activity of drug houses who are poisoning the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that, if matters involving moneys to be payable by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are to come before the Parliament, they should come before it by way of the Government seeking an amendment to the appropriate legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party, in regard to its platform, had not even given consideration to this matter until the Party had a conference in Launceston - a famous conference about which I trust the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be more informed in due course - at which it adopted a number of policy proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will certainly be in touch with each other and, as always in these cases, will endeavour to resolve the matter in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole and the people of Western Australia in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s responsibilities are all in different ways concerned with the quality of life which opens out before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Twenty-two years later, after the Government has been in office all that time, it produces a ministerial statement and pretends to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it is doing something constructive about the development of the creative and performing arts in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#debate-70">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the credit of the former Prime Minister, the right honourable John Gorton, he was determined to see that something was done to carry out the recommendations in the Willis report and he gave an undertaking to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Government would establish such a film and television training school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#debate-70">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, does this indicate that departmental and military advisers are usurping the role of the elected representatives of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711102_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister also indicate whether the Australian land sought to be sold by  Sir William  Gunn will be made available for purchase by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711102_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister assure the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Government is watching closely the fate of the Australian dollar and will take prompt action to prevent any unscrupulous speculation about the future of our dollar which could seriously harm the Australian economy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is incredible to me that that type of thinking can characterise some great sections of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> represented - and I think I say it fairly - in the political judgment of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the question with which we must be acquainted and concerned and which we must as far as possible try to convey to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have always found that in a crisis the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will face up to the demands of the situation, no matter how rigorous they may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are seeking to give leadership to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> so that they may think constructively about a situation that we do not seek but which may confront us in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until both s.ides of ihe Senate and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> recognise that a product cannot be viable in perpetuity unless it is by nature, quality and presentation what is required and is made available at a cost at which people are willing to purchase it, any kind of propping up by subsidies can be only a palliative in the short term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the leaders of the industry cannot reach unanimity of opinion it is the responsibility of the Government, on behalf of the growers and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, to take the initiative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of the remarkable statement by the Acting Prime Minister,  Mr Anthony,  in Sydney yesterday in which he discussed the question whether it was possible to find ways of marshalling the savings of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> so they would have the confidence and opportunity to invest in the ownership of their own industries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I said that I think that big business is endeavouring to do the best for Australia and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is  a  matter at which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are looking and with which they are vitally concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia a tremendous bank of available capital for commitment in the hands of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is: Reassure the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that there are worthwhile investments in Australia which arc completely above reproach, these investments being subject to the ordinary commercial risks which anyone speculating must be prepared to accept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Out of their 88 per cent the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can support whichever industry they like, but they cannot support all industries, because they do not provide all the money that is needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One might well say, without wishing to be unkind, that if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are concerned about the level of overseas investment and about all these other things, perhaps they could put their money where their mouths are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once these great developments are here we cannot move them away; they remain here forever for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, so long as the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> themselves are forthcoming as time goes on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these represent arrangements which this Government has made to provide devices by which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can, more and more, become investors in their own country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can be asked to do a great deal more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The governing influence is whether the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> demonstrate through time their own willingness to continue a high savings rate in the community and to put those high savings into the development of their own country by investing in Australian Resources Development Bank securities or by taking shares in some of those companies to which I have referred to a greater extent than they now do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only return to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> was the income tax imposed on the salaries of the workers plus, of course, the tax paid on the royalties that Hancock received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are avenues open to the Australian Government to retain an equity for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It allows this valuable asset that belongs to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - not to the Government, to the Liberal Party or the Country Party but to the people of Australia - to be taken away by overseas investors as they like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But honourable senators should be in no doubt that some of it is designed to serve particular causes which are not necessarily always the cause of Qantas or the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that that would be a very desirable thing to do and I would be happy to encourage it, because my attitude is simply that Qantas has belonged to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> through time and always will belong lo the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How long does the Government expect the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to continue donating goods and money for the relief of refugees while it takes no initiative itself to resolve the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is my belief that the long term interest of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> properly resides in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will be quite happy if at the end of it all we emerge with a bipartisan view because what matters here is an understanding of the real issues that concern the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, what 1 call the long term issues - the foreign policy issues, the defence issues and the economic policy issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is reflected in increased strength, stability, growth, opportunity and living standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If members of the Labor Party are genuine and want to reduce unemployment, and want to increase the real purchasing power of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s money, while they cannot put forward a blueprint of policies to be helpful perhaps they could listen while we do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our decision will be based on the interests of the Australian economy and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I  ask the Minister representing the Treasurer: Is it correct to assume that the presentinternational currency dilemma is of vital importance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  think that in retrospect we can say the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> lost, a glorious opportunity in not carrying on that forward planning which obviously was the result of sOme foresight and vision in the mid war years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>T was one of those who came into this Senate believing that housing was probably the greatest social problem facing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the States are made up of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who provide money for the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a nice question whether the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in their own right are entitled to be told something through the media or whether it should in the first place go through the processes of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the Government is of the opinion that this is not possible because of the economic depression now being experienced in Australia, will the Prime Minister establish machinery for an appeal to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in an endeavour to raiseatleast $10mfor this very worthy cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Australian Labor Party wishes to use this opportunity to say to the people of Australia that its policy is that every student who is capable of benefiting from an education, whether it is a primary or secondary school education or a teritiary education, should be able to do so under the best possible conditions; that the resources of the community should be mobilised so that they are shared in such a way that the best use is made of those resources; to ensure that we are not wasting those resources on the unnecessary proliferation of schools and systems of schools; and that the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that event the choice of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be kept on the Opposition benches for another 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these funds were denied to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - if the Bill were not passed by the Senate or if the Labor Party amendment were carried, which would result in the Bill not being passed - the community and the whole education process would suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 regard this as a matter of vital importance not only to the Australian Parliament but also, more importantly, to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regard the responsibilities of the Control Board and the Commission to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as being of paramount importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Board has been set up to control the commercial mass media of Australia, to ensure that they do not fall into the hands of too few people, to ensure that adequate and comprehensive programmes are presented by the commercial stations to serve the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, to make recommendations to the Government on vital matters of national importance such as the introduction of frequency modulation and, undoubtedly, colour television and, also, to make recommendations on any applications for renewal of licences and, in the case of issuing of new licences, recommendations on applications on the issuing of new licences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely on a mater of this nature which is of vital importance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> no-one would suggest, and I feel sure that the  Chairman  of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board would not suggest, that questions should not be asked or should not be answered, if they are asked, by officers representing the Broadcasting Control Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that such a suggestion, if carried out, would make for a much better understanding in the Parliament of the responsibilities of these instrumentalities to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government and its Ministers should be quite capable of looking at immigration in the correct light and of producing the right result for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want migrants - and 1 agree that perhaps we want some at this time - we should insist on having those who will come to Australia at their own expense and not be a burden on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that too many migrants are becoming a burden on Australia and it is wrong for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have to carry them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we have cited enough instances in this chamber today for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to understand - even if Government supporters cannot understand - that discrimination is being practised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>J think that some of the things that have been said from the Government side of the chamber are completely inconsistent with what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally are fairly tolerant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to something better from a Party which puts itself up as the alternative government of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I say is that these are areas upon which the Australian Labor Party is seeking to delude the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the areas upon which the Labor Party will not give a fair and square answer to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say this: The policy of the Labor Party, as  Senator Willesee  said, is a policy acceptable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have enough confidence in the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to believe that that would be followed by a backlash. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tt is a good scheme and it is acceptable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a warning to the Government not only from members of this chamber but also from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that they expect this Government, if it creates a portfolio to which some $30m of the Australian taxpayers’ money is appropriated for expenditure, to get on with the job and not to pussyfoot around. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that the Committee should carry this motion to show to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that at least this chamber means business even if the Government does not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They belong first to the responsible Minister and then to the Government as a whole in considering at a particular time the share of the national resources of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that should be devoted to particular projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we should do before we make any decision on any of these things, if the Commonwealth Parliament has not the power - I do not think it has under the Constitution - to impose, a moratorium on all high incomes, is to get together collectively in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and devise ways and means, by referendum if need be, to give the Commonwealth Parliament powers to impose restrictions on the earning of high incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it turns these thousands of wool growers out of the Australian countryside it will have done something despicable for which thousands of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will never forgive it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1967-68 when the referendum was passed and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> indicated that this was an area in which Commonwealth involvement was to take place, just under $20m was spent by the Commonwealth in its Territories and by the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Prime Minister aware of the statement by  Mr Anthony,  on 8th November 1971, when he discussed the question of whether it was possible to find ‘ways of marshalling the savings of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’ so that they would have the confidence and opportunity to invest in the ownership of their own industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more fear that we put into the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by reports such as this - the more we pander to those who have a self-interest in expanding and perpetuating the idea that international problems can be solved by war, the more troubles we will bring on our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Democratic Labor Party has sold to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, through radio and television, this propaganda that the Chinese hordes will come down through the islands, that the Red arrows will come down and that these people will do all sorts of things to our women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-133">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the reasoon why this has suddenly become a matter of great anxiety to the gentlemen opposite is that they have lost one of their great stocksintrade with which they have been accustomed to giving the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> nightmares, especially in election years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-133">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One has to take the view that what is regarded by the major powers as normal international behaviour should not be regarded in Australia as abnormal or as something that needs to worry the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, lt seems to me that this is tho theme that runs through the whole document when one looks at it objectively, free from the fears that so often have been expressed in debates in this chamber and in the other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government will try to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that this presence constitutes a great menace to us and will try to engender a feeling of fear about it in an attempt to win the 1972 election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleagues and I will support the amendment We will then wait and see whether the Democratic Labor Party is prepared to support us in any move to prevent the Government bringing down a further Budget which is against the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall the policy of the Opposition could be more acceptable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All wc have to do is lo make sure that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know and have revealed te them in all its stark nakedness the duplicity of a Labor Party which says one thing and does another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 go so far as to say that it is a view which is held by the vast majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian Labor Party is running counter to that view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this indicates the double standards which the Labor Party constantly adheres to and by which it seeks and will continue to seek, unless wc on the Government side and the people of Australia point it out, to delude the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ultimate temerity is that they attack me, as the Attorney-General, for challenging the Leader of the ALP to explain to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> where he stands on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have proved also in turn that the authorities in Australia lied to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about the exchange of letters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The whole idea of national service is against the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This objection is ingrained in the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are equally conscious of the rubbish that has been talked about in relation to this matter and of the yearly grandstanding when emotions, hysteria and posturing are a part of the order of the day and the serious matters of consequence to the total body of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not thoroughly and critically examined in a detached sense, which is what 1 believe needs to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a serious involvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I made the comment then that it has been said by the people who wrote about those years that there has been no time since then in the history of this Federation when quite such an excitement was to be found in the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these things are matters of supreme importance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have never believed that to have in the Senate a pale shadow of the debate in the House of Representatives on the same issue aided the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> very much at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The First World War made the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> one people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are tremendous words written by C. E. W. Bean that I do not have with me tonight which demonstrate how that was the event which made the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> feel as one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has had - and I hope it will always have - a long term and continuing interest in the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The process ought to be one in which they are checked against each other and, in the end, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> receive a better result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if we are to continue to have that system we should sit down as people involved in government and, in concert with one another at the various levels of government, learn how to work to the best advantage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have this concern because, while 1 regard a proper and sensible solution to Commonwealth-State relations as being both wise and necessary in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and all their governments, 1 believe that it is but a step on a path that must be trodden before long because if we do not resolve the management of the governmental scene between Commonwealth, State and local governments and if we do not have a wise use of Australian resources for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - a new, independent and rising nation - we will not be dealing with the next most important problem which is this: How do we learn to manage in a mixed economy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the passage of time the Government will come to realise the attitude of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly it has to be more notice than was given to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the case of the BHP increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have been joined in some measure - not always in the same words but in words which have the same effect - by persons such as the former Attorney-General,  Mr Hughes,  who only a few days ago said that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> could no longer be treated like children and that the Government was making stumbling attempts to explain the inflationary forces operating in our economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Together with the rest of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> we are not prepared to tolerate a position in which the Government fays: ‘There is nothing we can do about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is something which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want, expect and believe they are entitled to see carried out by their governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to them that the proper time to do this is when the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> give them office, and not before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is asking the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to give the Senate the powers of a price fixing authority, whatever else members of the Opposition may like to call it and despite  Senator Murphy  giving me his assurances that that is not what is meant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not have the relevant figures with me now, but the growth in the savings of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> has demonstrated where much of the money has found its way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> got out of that situation as fast as they could once they were given a chance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It speaks for a substantial portion of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as the general body of the community is concerned, gall up polls have shown that the great bulk of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are fairminded enough to endorse the principle that independent schools should obtain justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If South Australia is the yardstick - if it is the example of how this commission will work - I hope that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> never give the Australian Labor Party the opportunity to put this system into effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More importantly, it is an insult to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who are concerned at the manner in which the Australian Broadcasting Control Board is administering its responsibilities under the Broadcasting and Television Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will continue to do my duty to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to point out the weaknesses in the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that he has assured the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the aircraft will fly only over remote areas of Austalia on route to Sydney and Melbourne? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To satisfy his own purposes he tried to make a political debate when he had the floor in a television interview and to misinform the West <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore there is no harm to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in regard to a monopoly because no monopoly exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly, I hope that what is revealed by such an inquiry will flow to the benefit of TAA, considered as a public corporation, and to the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also involved is a very considerable direct interest on the part of the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> amounting to $35.8m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event, however worthy a citizen  Mr Thomas  may be, and however worthy the other persons involved may be, I do not think that money, money, money ought to be the primary concern of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question has to be decided in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The report of this Committee on this reference will be of tremendous value and importance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am not much concerned about who owns or controls the airline in competition with the airline of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that any person with any degree of responsibility who finds union leaders inciting unions generally and inciting them to refuse to accept the decisions of arbitration should, like the great mass of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, condemn the unions for their lawlessness in not accepting the decisions of arbitration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears to me that the AttorneyGeneral thinks he is acting on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by setting himself up as ombudsman not on behalf of the people but as ombudsman on behalf of the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Western Australian Opposition wants to challenge anything that the Western Australian Government or any Western Australian Minister has done, is doing cr intends to do, that Opposition has its rights and indeed has its responsibilities to the Western <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> give serious consideration to the remarks that the AttorneyGeneral has made tonight they will only confirm in their minds that this Government has to be defeated at the earliest opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Leader of the Government a statement to make to the Senate on what measures the Australian Government proposes to take to meet such an eventuality, thus helping to relieve the conscience prevailing among so many <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who now realise the futility of our involvement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a long term proposition which may be looked at, but I do not believe that the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the interests of the industry itself or the interests of the defence of this country can be served if we have the kind of amalgamation which is suggested, namely, that it would be on the basis that a private industry would have at least equal say in its operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have now reached a stage about which I am not able to be precise, except to say that it is my understanding that before very long - in a matter of a few days  -  I will be able to announce that they have been concluded satisfactorily and at quite a satisfactory price, so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> quite properly will be able to see telecasts of the Olympic Games. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is incumbent on the Government to inform the Senate and the people of Australia whether it is in fact true that the Minister while a member of the Liberal Party, prior to his becoming a Minister, was a member of a body which professes these aims to which I have referred and which sets out, on the face of it, to act against the interests of the Party to which he belongs and for which he was putting himself forward as a candidate to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ought to be aware of the shadow influences behind the Australian Labor Party, those influences which called for support for the North Vietnamese, those influences which seek to develop political strikes for ends which are identical with the ends which the communists support, those general policies in which elements in the ALP and the communists find no reason to disagree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is completely impossible for us to do this if we cannot use fully the facilities that have been provided through the money made available by the nation - that is, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to close the door totally in the face of this opportunity without examining it carefully would not seem to me to be what the Australian Democratic Labor Party really wants or what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would really wish us to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do mount  a  tremendous programme of saving and investment to develop their own country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it any wonder that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not prepared any longer, while the present Government, aided and abetted by the DLP which has moved this motion seeking this investigation, remains in office, to invest their capital in Australian undertakings, knowing that the Australian dollar is undervalued on the international monetary market and that millions of Australian dollars and probably millions of yen are being flaunted in a bid to take over Australian investments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter at which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are looking and with which they are vitally concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not married to a requirement of 20 per cent, 50 per cent or any other percentage, but some percentage should have been reserved for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would know whether overseas investment was being made for their benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that any Australian government with the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at heart is bound to indulge in a little economic nationalism even if it ls defensive rather than offensive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, we have been elected to look after the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people would support such a candidate, but the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are pretty sensible and are not likely to return a candidate to the Senate simply because he proposes to abolish taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been extended, in my view, to the off-shore petroleum resources legislation in which the proposition was put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that entry into the vast and wealthy off-shore oil industry was beyond the capacity of all except one Australian company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is possible that the coalition government, or perhaps some succeeding government, may desire in the future to seek capital from other than this country, and the areas in which the Territory has been able to obtain loans in the last two or three years, if we do not encourage the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, through this Government, to provide the necessary amount of finance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that among the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally there is a feeling of good will towards the new nation which will come into being before long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must exert our efforts collectively to try to get the Government to act upon the reports which are brought down and which I believe are of great significance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The inability of the Queensland Government to serve the interests of the Queensland people and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in arranging and signing these contracts, or its inability to bargain effectively, has had a direct result on the employment possibilities of miners in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In effect, in the federation of Australia it has been argued through time that it is proper and fair that all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should have equality of opportunity and that those who momentarily are better placed than the others should help those who are not so well placed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In many ways I suppose the attitude of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as I grew up was that, if we could build a dam and make 2 blades of something grow where only one blade grew before, we were achieving something. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having regard to the militancy of the political protestations which they utter so frequently, it may be that they can shed on this matter light which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should have given to them as to how such an event could have occurred, accepting what  Senator Hannan  said as a basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 must say - I do not intend my remarks to be directed against one airline or the other - that the whole purpose of our consideration of matters concerning the domestic airline industry is to provide for <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the best possible airline services that we can, and airline services which will reach the greatest number of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the state of Aboriginal rights, health, infant mortality, life expectancy, education, training, employment, ownership, movement and democratic political advancement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Peoples everywhere in Australia is unequal compared with people of European origin, whether migrating to or bom in Australia; and this constitutes a challenge to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on grounds of racial discrimination, racism and even forms of genocide; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister square the recent pronouncements and assertions by these senior Government Ministers with the statement made in Parliament by the Postmaster-General, as recently as 24th February, that in all its programming ‘This Day Tonight’ presented a balance of views on issues of concern to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Attorney-General: Were passports granted to the 10 men recently killed in a  clash with Yugoslav soldiers and, if so, could it fairly be said that the Australian Government’s failure to prevent this armed incursion against a state with which Australia has diplomatic relations was more detrimental to our international reputation than the use of passports by <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who are trying to establish, after years of governmental untruths, the real situation in Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would think that if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are denied the opportunity of seeing on television the Olympic Games, as threatened by one industrial organisation, it would be one of the most shameful misuses of power that this country has seen in a long while. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In essence, as the Treasurer said - it is worth repeating - the Budget means this to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>: Taxes are coming down, pensions and benefits are going up, and growth is to be strengthened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  <li>
    <p>I think that would be useful for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are noted for some particular characteristics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These matters will be developed in more detail and specifically by my colleagues who will take up various areas of Government proposals and expenditures and explain them precisely and in detail to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this country has one thing that matters, it is the incentive and the initiative of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are fed up with elections fought on nonissues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inclusion of this policy for the abolition of the means test is something which is rewarding to those members of the Government members’ committees who have strenuously pushed this as a means of providing social security for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Many <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in their early physical prime - I instance  Senator Cavanagh  and others - follow pretty hard and tough work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the changeover to independence is smooth and the going remains smooth it will be because of the influence of these people who will deserve credit from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are handing over the shares which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> own and that is what this Bill deals with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the problem the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have is a difficult one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is really not a great problem for them because this Government will be returned to office by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are able to receive direct coverage of the Olympic Games, will the Minister inform the Senate whether in fact it was  Mr Hawke’s  good offices which were responsible, as he has endeavoured to portray through the news media, or was it that the union, realising that it had abused its power by holding the nation to ransom, was concerned about the widespread public condemnation it would have received for its action? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we were all very pleased that the persons who last week had been threatening that they would prevent Australians seeing direct telecasts of the Olympic Games changed their minds at the last minute and permitted the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to see them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have every reason to be proud of the civil aviation achievements of this country, both in the domestic and the international fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are free to compete with each other, the purpose being to give equality of access and opportunity for both themselves and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that all members of this Parliament, and indeed the vast majority of Australians, will support these proposals to maintain ownership of air transport enterprises in the hands of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - every one of them - would agree with the summation of the Treasurer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would put unions above the law and that, I believe, <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not tolerate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that this is a Budget to be welcomed by the Senate, and it is a Budget that from my observations has been welcomed and well received already by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If anyone doubts the value of this Budget or the fact that it has been well accepted by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> he should study more closely the speech made by the main Opposition speaker in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wonder - I hope that many of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will wonder with me - what would be the level of unemployment in Queensland were it not for the development that has taken place in recent years throughout the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have sat in this ship of state, steered by this incompetent Government, knowing that they are heading for dangerous waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On reading those reports the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must have put on their thinking caps and come to a realisation of what is going on in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does not this Government realise that it worries the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to read reports such as those in the ‘Sydney Morning Herald’ of 25th July that Australian companies at the end of 1971 owed $5,204m overseas, that 87 per cent of the money owned by those companies was owed by predominantly overseas owned companies and only 13 per cent of that $5,204m was owed by locally owned companies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, because its own incompetence is being highlighted every day to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, is now trying desperately to shelve the blame on to other citizens of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A deliberate attempt has been made by the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon),  the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony),  the postmaster-General, the Attorney-General, other senior Ministers and back bench Government supporters in this chamber and in another place - members of the Liberal and Country Parties - to destroy in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the authenticity, the integrity and probity of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that the Government has woken up to the tremendous influence the programme has had, is having and is likely to have on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> during the course of the election campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be looking to the programme, bearing in mind the tightness of control of the mass media generally, for an independent assessment of the political complexities and arguments that will arise during the course of the forthcoming election campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This attack which has been launched against members of the current affairs programme This Day Tonight’ is designed deliberately to destroy in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the credibility of the ABC a mere 2 months before an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am satisfied that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not ‘time-servers*, concerned only with the pursuit of leisure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, without doubt, it has been geared to achieve social and economic goals of particular significance for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has shown awareness of change and has fixed new goals and new aspirations for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this cat and mouse game of the Prime Minister - causing 2 Houses of the Parliament to have to deal with this kind of indefinite motion, not knowing how to dispose of their business - is an affront not only to the Parliament but also to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is an example of the selective operation of law enforcement which the Labor Party has promised the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> it will give them if ever it should get into power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While I agree that an inquiry should not be necessary, to restore the faith of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to clean up this bunch of terrorists and would-be murderers, the popular belief is that an inquiry, perhaps a royal commission, should be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To achieve the best results for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole, we must together define the relationships, roles and contributions which will characterise our future co-operation in what we in the Commonwealth believe will be a major step towards further enriching the quality of life in our Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I feel that if it was only by one vote that the governing body of the Australian Labor Party decided to retain our security watchdogs, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ought to view with concern the possibility that one vote would change ai the next conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a salutory reminder when members of the Opposition bring up this matter for debate today, when we had all thought it was a dead issue, and when they provide for us once again an example of what is a general attitude to the law which I think bodes ill for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> if the Australian Labor Party were ever in a position to exercise power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Labor Party regards these Bills as a panic-stricken attempt by the Government to hoodwink the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into believing that in fact the tax concessions are of general benefit to the taxpaying community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the attention of the Senate and of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be drawn to the fact that in the period from 1950-51 to 1972-73, concessional deductions for life assurance and superannuation payments have, increased from $400 to $.1,200. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The decision of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> was to allow the Communist Party to engage itself in the political and democratic processes of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I daresay that if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were asked whether these foreign liberation movements that are operating in Australia were to be tolerated in this country they would have an overwhelming answer to that question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I do not believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be taken in by this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We commend the legislation because it is part of a move forward in respect to social services benefits for large numbers of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was 34 years ago and the National Insurance Act has never been proclaimed and its benefits have not been passed on to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chifley administration of 1948-49 certainly intended to place social service benefits on a firm foundation when it introduced the National Welfare Bill but again events intervened to prevent the enactment of legislation to give substantial benefits to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet he and his colleagues, encouraged to some extent by the mass circulation newspapers, endeavoured to make the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believe that Australia could not afford to abolish the means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This must happen if one pauses to think of the circumstances and the responsibilities of the 2 sections of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, on the one hand the person who perhaps has never married or who has married but has lost his or her partner, and on the other hand those who are fortunate enough to be sharing together their old age and retirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since every member of the community is potentially threatened by this growing menace, and since the aid and understanding of all law abiding citizens must be sought to combat it, will the Government actively seek the advice and cooperation of the community as a whole, informing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as far as possible of the true nature of the problem? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that this incident has revealed the very urgent necessity for consideration of the matter by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Senate and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are indebted to the Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Murphy)  for providing the Senate with an opportunity to debate not a question of components parts, as  Senator Laucke  put it in simplistic terms, but the important question of the future of a great Australian industry which undoubtedly will play a major part in the development of this country in the years ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are looking for and that is why they will turn to the Australian Labor Party at the election in November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its whole aim is to prevent as far as possible the full merits of the budgetary documents being expounded and being brought to the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, particularly because the proceedings of the Senate are being broadcast today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When that is tolerated by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and by this Government we will be at a very serious stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled will restore to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> true religious freedom, which can exist only when Church and Slate are legally separated both in form and substance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think any one of us is entitled to canvas the view that we may not think so, but as a Senate we have a responsibility and it is an increasing responsibility - and I think there is an increasing awareness of this in the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - that this is an institution which increasingly has to consider what I might call the long-term interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government takes the view that neither the time nor the circumstances are appropriate to bring about such a major change Nevertheless, as I have tried to indicate, the Minister for the Interior, the Government, and I in particular in my state of loco parentis, as it were, are quite interested to have the views of the Senate on this matter in the spirit in which I know they will  h&gt;:  delivered - that while there is a difference of view we will be looking at this in the spirit of what is best for the nation and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does he agree that these publications are of vital concern to honourable senators amd members of the other place as well as to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but that because of reading time limitations many reports are not read and not publicised? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would also observe for myself - this is not a departmental view but a senator’s view which I have expressed before - that I believe that the issues of quality of life, long term interest in the environment, conservation of resources and addition to resources are all very good matters to be considered by the Senate, which I regard as the custodian of the long term interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and their general heritage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 understand  Senator Keeffe’s  general view that we should look to this as a resource to be used in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the immense amount of land that we have and the tremendous ability of this country to grow timber sensibly and wisely, it is a resource that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are en- titled to expect us to provide for them, having regard to all the safeguards which should be preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think all honourable senators know of my long and sustained interest in this matter and of my great belief that the outstanding problem to be resolved in the Australian Federation is that of governmental relationships and what we are all trying to do in our general areas for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it quite unusual for the Australian Labor Party to be supporting the Government on this measure because after all the Labor Party was responsible for introducing this form of taxation to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that much purpose is served by trying to divide the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into those who shall have something and those who shall have nothing in the field of probate and estate duty because one has a philosophical concept of what people should seek to do in their lifetimes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that we, as a responsible people, should ask ourselves what is in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and of the generations which are now growing up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that that form of voting will be reimposed upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are too wise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the honourable senator not to prattle to me about the system at Westminister unless he wants to impose the whole of it on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and have voluntary voting as well as first past the post voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then perhaps the honourable senator may illustrate to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the system at Westminister is better than the system we have in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All of them will be given an opportunity to have access to the evidence and the information that the Senate Standing Committee on Industry and Trade can collate on this question to help them give to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the best results in the interests of all Australians, lt will not benefit the Australian Gas Light Co. if. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To give honourable senators an idea of how big a problem this is in the minds of the wide spectrum of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, I point out that the efficiency of industrial development and cheaper power and the provision of job opportunities for hundreds of Australians could easily be hampered and jeopardised without a national approach to this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian people</span> -I think the Minister for Civil Aviation  (Senator Cotton)  has emphasised this - is that there was competition between overseas manufacturers and Australian manufacturers which brought about a situation in which a great Australian principal is giving an overseas manufacturer the benefit of$1 50m worth of manufacture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party’s attitude is that it will examine the evidence that will be placed before the Standing Committee in 1973, and it will reach a determination which will be in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have said already, in her part of Victoria  Mrs McLean  has been one of the few people responsible for drawing to the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the horrors and futility of the Vietnam war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a pity that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not have a greater opportunity than they have at the present time to see the way in which members of the Australian Labor Party behave in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If it is not too late, I plead with the Attorney-General to show some compassion in this matter, at least to give  Mrs McLean  credit for having the courage of her convictions, and at least recognise that she is the mother of young Australian children and allow her to go home to those young Australian children rather than suffer indignity under a law which, as  Senator Cavanagh  says, is not upheld by some 60 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The tremendously high reputation that the Department and its staff have and the regard that <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have for civil aviation interests are a compliment to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has required a great deal of money to be invested on the ground - and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have invested that money on the ground facilities, not the airline operators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No-one can be sure that the course we are taking will, in the long run, be the most satisfactory course for the Aboriginal people or for their relationships with the rest of the people of Australia, but it is an effort which must be made and it is an effort which stems from a conscience which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have in an enlightened age with respect to activities which occurred a century or so ago between our forebears and the forebears of today’s Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I mention these things because I do not believe that it aids an understanding of the approach which the Government is making, nor does it aid an appreciation in an objective way of what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole are trying to do, for  Senator Keeffe  to come into this place time and time again and to parade a lot of erroneous statements designed to create the impression that this Government is doing absolutely nothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If some of the fluctuations in the price of the product were brought about by deliberate manipulation then this legislation announces to everybody who may be encouraged to try again that they will be up against the same solid front with all the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> supporting this industry as they did before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that time will be available to me to draw to the attention of the Senate and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the hypocrisy of the Government in talking about establishing an authority which will change the whole fabric of our society, which will arrest the decline of the quality of life in the cities, and which will bring about a regeneration of life in our rural areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He did so on television, with a great deal of reluctance, and stated a private point of view at that time that what he thought he had said was in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but that had nothing to do with what his actions would be subsequently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it would be tragic if this Senate were to adopt a motion such as the one which is before it tonight so that before Papua New Guinea obtained its independence it would be faced with a declaration from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that we were adamant that we would not transfer these islands to Papua New Guinea even though they are only a few miles from the mainland of Papua New Guinea, even though they are part of the continental shelf surrounding Papua New Guinea, and recognised by international law as being the waters of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Labor Party has long had the abolition of the death penalty as a major plank in its platform of social and legal reform, which is supported by the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the trend of world-wide opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is therefore fitting that the first Bill which I introduce into this Senate as Attorney-General should be a Bill to which the Senate has previously given its assent and which will give effect to the wishes of a substantial majority of (he <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Labor Party had the courage of what it is now doing it would have been prepared to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> during the election campaign it was proposing to introduce this measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that that wish of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is simply that honourable senators opposite do not follow and cannot accept what was accepted overwhelmingly by the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, when the Labor Party received more votes than the combined vote of all the other political parties in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we have brought to the conscious attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> only the essential geography of Japan and its implications, we will have started a communication or a thought process that will be worth while. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We all saw an example of this when the Prime Minister, at a Press conference, tried to excuse the rude and distasteful personal attacks that his Ministers had made on the American  President  by saying that he had a mandate from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to bring the Vietnam war to an end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are in the unfortunate situation that, irrespective of the defence need and the nation’s security, it is not these factors that will dictate whether a small contingent of ground forces remains in Singapore or whether some other aspect of defence, policy is implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government in its conduct of the nation’s affairs has subordinated the security and welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on whose behalf it should govern to the factional decisions of the Conference and Executive of the Australian Labor Party in that: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Originally they were stated by the Prime Minister as promoting equality, involving the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the decision making processes of the law and liberating the talents and uplifting the horizons of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As was pointed out to the Senate by the Leader of the Opposition, under the electoral system the Labor Party can come to office without the first preference support of 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and yet acquire 54 per cent of the seats at the election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I imagine that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are somewhat worried about what is the true policy of the Government, because if some other amendment is moved to this statement, will we get a different speech? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the Labor claims of the past: ‘These bases are bad for Australia, we should not have them and we ask you, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, to vote the Government out and to vote us in’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party has a simple rule of diplomacy and it is this: ‘Oppose anything that is American; oppose anything that is British; oppose anything that is French: oppose anything that is from the democratic Free World and from the kidney and kith of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and realign Australia with the communist dominated Third World. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should understand the significance of the appointment by the United States Government of  Mr Marshall  Green, a remarkably able diplomat of senior status, beyond ambassador to ambassador at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, this is the greatest piece of deception that any government could thrust on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because what the Government is saying to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is: ‘You can trust us because we are willing to let your legislators from the Liberal Party, Country Party, DLP and the Labor Party go and look. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is sincere on this question, it will not be saying to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>: ‘Parliamentarians can go on a picnic tour and therefore you are safeguarded’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many honourable senators opposite dissembled with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and misrepresented these bases as being weapons of attack, part of a weapon system? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who have preached fear over the last year or two to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will have it recoil on them because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> now know that when honourable senators opposite cry wolf there is no wolf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In effect he said that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are a lot of idiots with no intelligence whatsoever and that they listen to any type of argument put forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course there is nothing wrong with them, but why could nol the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been told that there was nothing wrong with the bases? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>will he state when the Prime Minister intends to put that proposal before the Australian Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for their consideration? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> expect the Government to do whatever it can to stop that development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Also in the context of television and radio as well as elsewhere, the present philosophy of free enterprise media as necessarily responsible to the public only in the sense of ‘giving the public what it wants’ must be carefully  rescrutinised,  for behind this ‘cheap popular entertainment’ philosophy, there may well be found to lie a ruthless  ‘bread-and-circuses’  strategy of persuasive-manipulative-exploitative control over the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, supplementing coercive control via establishment-orientated electoral gerrymandering in the interests of government by and for the rich and privileged few and their tame-cat legal decision-making bodies such as the Arbitration and Industrial Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The change is occurring because of a decision of the Australian Government in pursuance of its electoral policy, endorsed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that the fragmentation of the law enforcement forces at the Federal level should be ended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Frankly, I regard this as an insincere attempt on the part of  Senator Gair,  supported by the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Country Party, to use the fact that this House is being broadcast at this time to bring on this motion so that they, can bring out the old McCarthy stunt which we have heard from them for so long and which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have rejected on so many occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the first acts of this Government was to give a passport to this person who has raised a great deal of controversy and doubt in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, because of the things that he himself has said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not accept the proposition involved in blackguarding a man in his absence when there has been an opportunity to deal with him judicially. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I warn the Liberal Party that if it wants to play any sort of role in opposition and receive any respect from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> it should abandon these absurd tactics, which have been discredited not only in this country but also throughout the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Labor Government would be: Firstly, to promote equality; secondly, to involve the people of Australia in the decision-making processes of our land; and thirdly, to liberate the talents and uplift the horizons to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I recall that in my opening remarks I said that the address presented to us was far ranging and brought innovation to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-65">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The other principle upon which I state my case - I do so very firmly, for all my misdemeanours - is that the great majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believe that marriage  is  a fundamental security, not in any spiritual or theoretical sense but in a practical sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However misguided one might consider an AttorneyGeneral who placed the interests of an obvious terrorist ahead of the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, there might be some who would be impressed by the countervailing libertarian considerations on which his submission is apparently based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> look forward to having a separated security intelligence organisation and a separated police force, or will we find that we have a welding and a melding into one organisation of some sort of political police under the direction of one man? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole of Australia knows that the reason why the Attorney-General had to go and interfere with the affairs of ASIO was that ASIO was not doing its job by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senateassembled will restore to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> true religious freedom, which can only exist when Church and State are legally separated both in form and substance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I understand that because of the heavy cost factors involved, the possibility of getting satellite television directly into the homes of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is still fairly remote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister give an assurance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that ample notice of Saturday morning closure will be given to those people who transact post office business on that day so that suitable alternative arrangements may be made? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Within those documents there are inferences against <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who have never been charged in Australian courts with any crime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One would want to have this justified in view of what it means to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who ordinarily must pay the cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will decide at the ballot box whom they want - whether they want the Government that is prepared to legislate on the basis of the mandate it has secured or whether they want the carping Opposition that is frustrating the legislation that we propose to pass on behalf of this nation and the people within it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition has a responsibility to protect the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> against the arbitrary acts of the current Government, and it will seek to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this thing goes through, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will have great cause to regret it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government should give a lead and say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>: ‘If we want productivity we will not get it by class conflict or industrial conflict; we will get it by commercial and industrial teamwork, when it is understood that the employer and the employee are not different people standing in different corners but people whose goals are the same’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have heard speakers say tonight: ‘Would it not have been better in post war years if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had given the government of the day constitutional power over prices?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By doing all those things the Government pretends to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it can do something which, in its heart of hearts, it knows it cannot do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He ought to have been frank with the Senate and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are looking for is not only the truth but the whole truth and nothing but the truth, and an Attorney-General should aid them and not hinder and mislead them in that quest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But he had committed no act of violence in Australia and in my opinion, to deport a person to such a country where he will be persecuted for his political opposition to the Government of that country is not my concept of how an Australian Government should act - or of how the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would expect it to act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is, Marincic -  had committed no act of violence in Australia and, in my opinion, to deport a person to such a country where he will be persecuted for his political opposition to the government of that country is not my, concept of how an Australian Government should act - or of how the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would expect it to act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I repeat that what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are interested in are the answers to the specific charges which have been made by  Senator Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will not be distracted from the preservation of the lives and safety of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by red herrings and dishonest answers such as those which have been given by honourable senators who are now in Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know from 23 years experience how much they can expect in the way of civil liberties and civil rights from the Liberal Party, the Democratic Labor Party and the Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the past 5 weeks the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the members of this Parliament have been gravely misled and mischievously deceived by the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If something has happened why have not the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General got to their feet and told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aim was to say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Yugoslav Prime Minister was in such mortal danger that those things were necessary; that what the Attorney-General was going to say about Croatian terrorism was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly I refer to an example of the way in which an impression which is misleading has been given to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in relation to the Croatian community here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will surely develop their own armed forces to deal with counterrevolutionary violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General has produced evidence which he thinks had been hidden from the Parliament and from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do not believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be taken in by this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That this Federal Conference of the Commonwealth Police Officers’ Association in session wishes to express its wholehearted support to the AttorneyGeneral,  Senator L.  K. Murphy, in his campaign to eliminate all terrorist activities that are contrary to our Australian way of life, and also expresses its complete co-operation in his endeavours to make the Commonwealth Police the strong, active, viable force it must be for the benefit and betterment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, we see evidence today of the Australian Democratic Labor Party joining forces with the other sections of the Opposition in an endeavour to carry an amendment which seeks to condemn the actions of the AttorneyGeneral who had the courage to do what he did and who has the support of the overwhelming majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the organisation which  Senator Murphy  has seen fit to mention in this place in order to acquaint the Parliament, as I think he is duty bound to do, and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of its existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Webster,  who preceded me in the debate, said that  Senator Murphy,  by the action which he took on behalf of the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, was guilty of what  Senator Webster  described as a dereliction of duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable senator thinks that all that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are worried about is the raid on ASIO, then thank goodness, so far as we are concerned, the honourable senators opposite will remain in opposition for another 23 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that instead of the Senate having to consider this motion of want of confidence in the Attorney-General, this Australian Parliament, having regard to the interests and welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, should be lauding the activities of the Attorney-General, and I believe that no matter what our friends in the Opposition do, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will applaud him for the -action he took to protect the lives and welfare of Australian citizens and visiting dignitary to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a Government in Australia which is determined to see that not only the migrants but also the rest of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be able to live free of this terror and violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The guilty men opposite know that they have allowed terrorism and violence to persist, and this attempt to assuage their guilt will not prevail because they have been convicted in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I notice that  Senator Murphy,  in the course of his second reading speech, claimed as one of the justifications for introducing this measure that it will represent the opinion of a substantial majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator should be aware that in accordance with its undertaking to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the general election the Government has taken up directly with the French Government the question of the legality of French atmospheric tests in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he convey to the French Government the strong feeling of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> against these tests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe he should be congratulated by the people of Australia for trying to implement some of the measures that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> told the previous Government by referendum should be implemented but which the previous Government failed to implement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far too many questions have been left unanswered and we believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have the right to know what is the correct position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The duties that he has performed for the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> today have not involved danger to the lives of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly on the balance of probabilities, if not beyond reasonable doubt,  Senator Murphy  has convinced the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that there are terrorists in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will get the facts and then the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that we will have to rely on the good sense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who believe - I think for good reasons - that there have been outrages in this country, that bombs have gone off on the streets, that there is a running vendetta between Croat terrorists and the Yugoslav Government and who applaud the fact that a government is at least in office which is prepared to do something about the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was held in high regard by the members of the Australian Parliament and by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  passing was felt by many in this Parliament and throughout the community as a deep personal loss of one who was not only a man of public affairs but also a friend of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the AttorneyGeneral, as a result of his recent talks with French Government Ministers, tell the Senate whether, in his opinion, the people of France have been made aware of the intensity of feelings of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> against the proposed atmospheric nuclear tests in the Pacific? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it was important that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> be given some indication of the way in which this Act was being operated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is important that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know that the number of approvals is of that order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is where the Australian Government stands, and in doing that it is expressing the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former Prime Minister,  Mr McMahon,  stated  -  I think towards the end of his term - that he was against the tests and that this was the view of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general view of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is one of objection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not quite sure about the attitude of the Democratic Labor Party but I would think that the mass of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as well as the great political parties are against those tests and we will continue to exhibit our protests against the testing by anyone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a statement which, interesting as it may read as a travelogue, lacks what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and this Parliament have been waiting for for several months and that is a clear, definite statement of the foreign policy which this Government is following: what are the implications and consequences to the Australian nation of the totally different slant which our foreign policy has been taking since 5th December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will not, however, permit any State Government or State agency to frustrate the clear will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> recorded so overwhelmingly in the 1967 Referendum that the national Government should assume constitutional responsibility for Aborigines and Torres Strait islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My advisers will not hesitate to use these full constitutional powers granted by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in asserting and establishing the national will on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As time goes on and as we have the opportunity to draft additional legislation, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who, if we take note of the opinion polls, are already well satisfied with the Labor Government, will rally even more to that Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister give an assurance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that ample notice of Saturday morning closure will be given to those people who transact post office business on that day so that suitable alternative arrangements can be made? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-81-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is clearly in opposition to these nuclear tests, particularly to atmospheric nuclear tests anywhere and especially to those which are being conducted in our own hemisphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently the Opposition wants to re-fight the Vietnam war - an issue which was put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the election which was held last December, which gave the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the opportunity to show that they supported overwhelmingly the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> knew before the election that we would be recognising that Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, on the election of the Labor Government, it was the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that this should happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against our inclination, without our approval and by a policy of deception and subterfuge, supported by a practice of secrecy, half truths and prevarication the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are being drawn into a communist orbit- We are being brought into the world of those who practise totalitarianism, those who believe in the lie as a weapon of government and those would deny freedom to those would dissent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> being informed of what is happening, we are being taken into the world of the communists by a Labor Government which is influenced by persons who know full well the intentions and the objectives they want the Labor Government to pursue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that this is happening without our approval because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have never been given any opportunity to vote on these issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that there is subterfuge because all of this is being hidden and not disclosed to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this is not revealed by the Press of this country to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, but it ought to be because it indicates the real alignment and association which are involved in this activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his policy speech last November, the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  said that the Australian Labor Party was determined that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be restored to their rightful place in their own country, as the owners and keepers of the national estate and the nation’s resources, and as fair and equal sharers in the national wealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The owners and keepers of the national estate and the nation’s resources are the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and their Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am proud to be introducing legislation on behalf of a Government which has the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at heart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So much so that the Prime Minister is meeting with the Premiers of the States, I think on Thursday, in order to discuss ways in which the cooperation of the States might be gained in tha endeavour on behalf of the whole community to see that this problem of inflation is resolved in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Attorney-General, would willingly move to abolish the death penalty in the Commonwealth Crimes (Aircraft) Act of 1963, I would expect to have the responsibility to say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>: ‘I assure you that to the limit of our abilities, in the safety features, in the security warning features of our aircraft, in the teamwork of our aircraft crews, in the security at our airports and in the searches that we do of luggage of cargo and of persons, and not just the sporadic ones, we are minimising this’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are to be told the negative - that is, that the threat of death will be removed as a penalty on a person who hijacks an aircraft - I ask: Why should the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> be told the positive? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>(4.50) - It is quite clear that the combined Opposition in this chamber - the Liberal Party, the Country Party and the Democratic Labor Party - is deliberately setting out to frustrate the Government’s legislative program and to thwart the desires of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> clearly expressed at the ballot box on 2 December last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am inclined to think that an attempt is being made to discredit Australia’s representative who is to present the case for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> before the International Court of Justice against the French nuclear tests which will be held in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I simply remind the Senate and the people of Australia that there could be a circumstance in the future which would require the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to decide whether they want a situation in which the Senate holds up legislation of the government which has been supported by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have had today is a continuation of what was started when this Parliament first sat after the election - a combination of minority parties which do not have the support of the people of Australia wanting to decide what the Senate shall do and wanting to take out of the hands of the Government in the Senate its power to introduce the legislation which it has been authorised by mandate of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to introduce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During all the years that the previous Government was supposedly pro tecting the interests of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, this information was available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When  Senator Murphy  tackles this problem with courage, intelligence and vigour, we have simpering people coming here and trying to kid me and to pull the wool over the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by saying that something wrong has been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind honourable senators that the documents say, amongst other things, that the Croatian people offer no threat, hold no grudge, have no reaction against the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that they are dedicated to Australia as their homeland, and that none of their actions are directed in any harmful way to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He should let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Surely, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by saying that, if the Government refuses this select committee, only one inference can be drawn by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; namely that this Government has a great deal to hide on all these terms of reference and it is determined to hide it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that there are some in the Senate with sufficient common sense to understand its history and to realise that public affairs cannot be conducted in this way and that the motion ought, in the interests of the Senate as well as in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, especially the Croatian community which is sought to be used as a pawn by Opposition members- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have just listened to another attack upon the credibility on the Leader of the Government in this chamber  (Senator Murphy)  and, indeed, upon the vote of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I said yesterday during the course of a debate that took place in this chamber, the Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are sick and tired of the frustration and the thwarting of Government business that has been caused by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest, as I suggested yesterday, that it is about time the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> realised what is going on in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a government that has many things to do for the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is that what  Senator Withers, Senator Greenwood, Senator Wright  and  Senator Young  are putting to the Senate and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that the 3 votes that  Senator Young  claims were denied tonight were votes automatically to be cast in support of the motion submitted by the Democratic Labor Party? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has not yet tumbled to the fact that he no longer occupies one of the power bastions in Canberra and in this chamber, that there has been a change of Government and that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have voted out his Party and have given the Australian Labor Party a mandate to carry out the program that it announced in the course of the last election campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However unpalatable the decision of 2 December might be to some, that is the wish of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact it is a poor reflection on this Government that it expects the Senate and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to accept amendments which will alter aspects of the Electoral Act that have stood up for 70 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would imagine, as a result of the contributions from the speakers who represent the combined view of the Opposition, that the views of the Australian Labor Party have been hidden in past years, that it has never endeavoured to explain itself in respect of the principle of one vote, one value and that it has, in fact, endeavoured to fool the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The greatest barrier to the ALP is not the electoral system but the fact that so often it has proved to be unworthy of the majority support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - this is the important point - are entitled to know that every time they record a vote on the ballot paper their vote means as much, whether they are living in Sydney, Kalgoorlie, Hobart or Cairns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is  a  proposal, I understand, whereby the Government seems bent on taking from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the ultimate in their system of preference and their freedom of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, Australian voters, owe this singularly fair situation to a long list of distinguished leaders, not the least of whom have been great Labor Prime Ministers, and of course to the commissioners through the years, all of whom are of great integrity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they again refuse to pass the legislation which seeks to give some electoral justice to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as has been said by the Leader of our Party,  Mr Whitlam,  and by many Government Ministers, the Parties opposite will be called on to face the electors and to face the consequences which will follow from their actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With those few remarks, I give my full support to the Bill and the measures it contains which seek to give some electoral justice to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the following words be added to the AddressinReply: ‘, but the Senate is of the opinion and regrets that - The Government in its conduct of the nation’s affairs has subordinated the security and welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on whose behalf it should govern to the factional decisions of the Conference and Executive of the Australian Labor Party, in that: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The views of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be considered when the Government eventually determines its policy on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I submit that it would not be able to take precedence over legislation arising from the Government’s Budget which I expect will be presented to the Australian Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on 21 August. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To engage in a manoeuvre whereby consideration of this Bill is to be deferred for 3 months is a deliberate effort by the Opposition to set aside the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as it was most clearly expressed on 2 December last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While  Senator Wheeldon  pointed to the policy speech of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  delivered before the last election as granting him a mandate from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, it must also be said that there are major sections within the Australian Labor Party and the leaders of the State Parties in a number of States who really do not accept that as a decision of the people, and apparently they do not accept it as the policy of the Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, through a variety of governments and a variety of political philosophies, have a great deal to be proud of for the the record which they have achieved in connection with the emergent nation of Papua New Guinea under trusteeship, under guardianship or under custodianship - call it what you will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that it is something of which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, irrespective of their political persuasions, can be proud and will in the years ahead become increasingly proud. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that by the end of this year there will be approximately 6 amendments to the Electoral Act, introduced by the Labor Party simply to illustrate that it is dealing with this matter piecemeal with a view to deluding the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that each of those amendments in itself is worthwhile; but as a comprehensive whole the people will not realise that the electorate is being gerrymandered to foster the interests of the Labor Parly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In any case, the more important task then was to provide jobs and Food for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> rather than to worry about these other aspects of civil liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the end, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s resources will be put to use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, all parties have a mandate from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to conserve and to regu late the precious energy sources of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am opposed to the inherent threat to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of a socialist takeover which demonstrates, in everything that is does, that it costs the people a darned sight more than if the ordinary interplay of the market were to take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has cost the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> many millions of dollars to find oil in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In terms of cost and benefit we will have to ask what types of energy are best suited and the most viable to provide at the cheapest cost to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> power which is needed by those who require it for their various operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>and which I think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were led to believe, was behind so much of the grandiose policy schemes which were brought forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All those statutory bodies have been of tremendous benefit to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite sure that the concept that we are considering tonight will prove in the long run to be of great benefit to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as did the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority and the other bodies to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the same argument, the previous Government had sufficient money to spend on that exercise, and I am sure that nobody in this Senate, even on the Opposition side, would for one moment suggest that that expenditure on the Fill will be of as much value to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as is the national pipeline concept contained in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is simple and has the clear and definite purpose to set up an Authority with adequate powers to construct  and  operate a major public utility having the responsibility of making one  of  our greatest natural resources available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Was  Mr Mick  Young, who travelled on a VIP plane to Europe with the Prime Minister, a guest of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, or did he pay his fare? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We issue a very clear and a very firm warning that we reserve our right as an Opposition, irrespective of what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> might have voted for, to take this matter under consideration at any time if it is shown that this Tribunal is being used as an instrument of unfair, unreasonable or impractical policies or if any attempts at victimisation or intimidation are made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time the real wages of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were increasing at the highest rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A country that is making a healthy rate of profits is making an increasing rate of Consolidated Revenue, and if this is so, Australia can distribute equally amongst the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the real earnings of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if today we take into consideration the indirect benefits that flow through State and local government instrumentalities to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the average family receives back in services and handouts about the equivalent of the average weekly wage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is presented to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as though it were an attack on the legitimate people to be attacked - the big wealthy companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So no one can get health insurance to cover these ancillary services which are so vital to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that it is my responsibility during this debate on the motion for the first reading to answer some of the comments that have been made by  Senator Turnbull  and  Senator Carrick  on this important issue concerning the health and welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr N.  H. Bowen also said in relation to the Bill that ‘this issue was put very fully from time to time before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and at the last election they voted the present Labor Government into power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister ensure that these aircraft, at an early date, make a comprehensive tour of all States so that the aircraft may be put on display for viewing by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that our plan, when introduced, will have the overwhelming approval of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Government is attempting to do is to bring about the creation of this Authority which will have tremendous benefits to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as the years go by. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no question about the contents of the electoral program that  Mr Whitlam  placed before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a tactic which I am sure the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will see through, which I am sure the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not appreciate and which I am sure in the long run will act against the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that  Senator James  McClelland was very much out of touch with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in all the things he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think the Federal Government would be game to seek approval of its proposal by putting to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by way of referendum the provisions contained in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it tried to alter the Constitution of Australia as the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had expressed it by referendum, the British Parliament, even 73 years ago, met with the most stubborn opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are sick and tired of that sort of thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new responsibilities undertaken were an acknowledgement of the awareness of the real problems of a mounting population concentration in our major cities, problems which had a real bearing on the quality of life of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, problems of pollution of the air and waterways, congestion of roads and highways and lack of open space, of ever increasing difficulties and costs involved in maintaining essential services in cities of high population densities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will be of benefit to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Government’s intention to proceed with the implementation of its statement not only to the people of Tasmania but to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole that it will establish such a Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian people</span> might perhaps wonder whether some of our ideas are not becoming a little grandiose for a country of our size. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek that assurance because there has been wrought on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the greatest piece of hypocrisy, something that only socialists can do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To sum up, it is quite apparent that all reasonable steps have been taken by the government with the purpose of setting up an authority which will be of benefit to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the unwillingness of the Australian Labor Party and  Senator Cavanagh  in particular to face up to that argument which exposes the whole case for the fraudulent sham on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It took3 pages to bring in a Pipeline Authority Bill of immense consequences both in its broad intent, its purpose and the consequential expenditure in which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are free to compete with each other, the purpose being to give equality of access and opportunity for both themselves and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If they do it will be conclusive proof that this amendment is a device to defeat the Bill in the interests of Ansett and to .the detriment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who are the owners, of TAA. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then we will see a big improvement in the fairness, and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who own the government airline will be able to see some fruits for the money they have invested in its operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To put the point another way, the French Government has no right to impose upon the Australian Government the French Government’s views of what are acceptable levels of radiation doses for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That particular shipment was stopped in order to prevent the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> being exposed to danger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I join  Senator Jessop  in asking whether, in view of the Minister’s own outspoken attack on the laws of libel, he will arrange to table in the Senate, where they are priviledged, an exact transcript of  Mr Whitlam’s  remarks and so allow the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to form their own judgment on their Prime Minister, a judgment which is becoming increasingly adverse, as the weekend gallup poll showed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us face the fact that most <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> come from British stock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would want Her Majesty’s^ title to appear  in  full at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought to myself that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, when they chose a government last December to try to run this country deserve better than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reply provided by the Minister for Health was to the effect that the question of the foods provided to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> was basically a matter which came within the ambit of the Pure Foods Acts of the various States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we can be sure that the Prime Minister and those connected with the contest will see that it is carried out with impartiality and in order that the best result may be obtained for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> so that we may have an anthem that we can live with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the greatest confidence trick to be played upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is the proposal that this scheme be administered in conjuction with the Australian Grants Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already the arrogance and the power hunting of the Labor Government have been shown to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Government now stop misleading the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on the matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he publicly ask the Opposition in the Senate whether all moves made by it to change any legislation brought before this House are made for and on behalf of and in the best interests of Australia and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In reply to the seventh question, yes, I believe that all legislation should be the best that can be produced in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to permit the Government to carry through legislation which has been endorsed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time in 23 years the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are able to hold up their heads and are being regarded throughout the world with the respect which was given to Australia only in the period when  Dr Evatt  was representing us at the United Nations, when a previous Labor Government was in office and when Australia took a major part in the affairs of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of vital importance to Australia, and any talk about being able to satisfy the demands of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for greater benefits can depend only on increasing growth and increasing the total economic wealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was a wonderful Australian who believed in putting before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the things that mattered as far as humans were concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words this represents a desire on the part of the Government to open up a store of knowledge to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly we are prepared to co-operate with the citizen advice bureaux in any way to provide to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> information about the Government and matters of concern to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister consider that the wording used in the Budget fairly informed the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Parliament of the increased burden by way of additional charges to be levied by Commonwealth Government instrumentalities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And received an overwhelming mandate from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as my colleague  Senator O’Byrne  has said, to get on with .the job of bringing about a balance in the educational system throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only have the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education broken a promise to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, but they have continued to break it and are apparently proud to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am disappointed to the extent that I appeal to the Labor Party - a great Party which is in power at the present time - not to renege on the promises given to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but to revise its decision and do as it said it would do, that is, to follow the Karmel Committee’s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a great Party, which has come into power, promised the people, through its policy, that it would continue this support and then denied it - if the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education gave to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> promises relating to the continuation of this support and then denied them - what are the people able to believe of the Labor Party? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I may be forgiven for injecting a note of class warfare into the proceedings of the Senate I, along, I believe, with the overwhelming majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, believe that it is totally improper, totally unjust, something to be condemned and something to be deplored that when a wealthy Melbourne stockbroker wants to send his son to Geelong Grammar School he should receive precisely the same assistance as a widow at Paynes Find, Western Australia, who wants to send her child to a state high school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Carrick,  as is his wont, saw in this decision another proof that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> elected a Bolshevik government last December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us say, and say again, that there is no argument about this situation now but the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Senate need to be reminded that the principal opponents in the early days of State aid for schools were the members of the Labor Party who are so vigorously attempting to defend their situation tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The statement which has just been read by  Senator Willesee  on behalf of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  is unworthy of the Prime Minister and is less than the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and this Parliament deserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister is more than a talented individual; he is the Prime Minister of this nation and, as such, must represent the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What he has done in the short statement he has given to the Parliament - it was nothing more than a travelogue - is to indicate his contempt for the Parliament, his contempt for the Opposition and thereby his contempt for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian nation deserve better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there was anything that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were ashamed of it was the subservience of the previous Australian Government to other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was apparent that the Mexican people have the greatest feelings of warmth and friendship towards the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and this has been enhanced by the visit of  Mr Whitlam  to Mexico. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why is it that these attacks are being made on a man who has done his utmost to rectify the errors that had been made over 2 decades and which in the last decade had brought Australia into discredit and disgrace and had made the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ashamed of their foreign policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are proud of what is being done on their behalf in foreign affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw your attention to the fact that throughout that paper there is reference to the French nuclear tests, that the Court of Justice had reached a decision and to the attitude of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The simple tact is that the Australian Prime Minister in his recent journey abroad, the facts of which he does not intend to convey to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, failed at every level of his alleged endeavour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Government stop misleading the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government has not misled the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are elected to this Parliament by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was able to show this lady that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are most mindful of problems in the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our attitude is an admirable one and it has been supported by the overwhelming majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ought to be well aware of the fact that they may incur these quite heavy duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What it fails to understand is that the present system is fair and equitable, because in December last year the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> voted for a Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It wishes to change the legislation so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not have a fair chance of throwing the Labor Government out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Daly  claims that the Government’s intentions in relation to the Electoral Act were well publicised and that it is carrying out what it told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the Labor Party would do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not benefit the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas in the past we have all viewed the Electoral Act as fair and equitable, it will mean in the future that every party will believe the Electoral Act is there for its own purpose and not with the intention of allowing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to elect a Government that they prefer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not shirk from allowing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> an opportunity to pass judgment on the performance of the Government nor of ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it really is the view of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that anyone who commits treason should not be hanged, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must believe that no person should be hanged for any crime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view, if the act of treason which so easily can cause the death of thousands - it can cause the fall of a nation - is not punishable by death by hanging, and if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> share the belief of the vote of the Senate in that respect, they do not want death by hanging in their statutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a Budget which will give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the worst-continuing inflation and a. rapid rise in unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The last honourable senator who spoke praised the present Government because no promise was broken and because it has pursued a wonderful policy in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As members of a party we decided that because of the promises we made to the electorate we should arrange the Budget in a concept that would restore to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the welfare standards that have been eroded by many years of the Liberal-Country Party governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> welcome the sort of strong and independent role which the Australian Labor Party is now assuming with respect to the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think that most <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would agree with the statement which was made by the Federal Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  when he presented his first Budget 8 days ago in the other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He drew the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the program of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of us who have spoken to the Treasurer can assure the Senate and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that in fact this Budget represents the decisions of the Treasurer and of the Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To suggest therefore that the rising price of land can be attributed to nearly 8 or 9 months of this Government’s tenure of office seems to me to be an attempt to fool the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the current financial year we intend to spend an additional $789m on social welfare programs for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, sadly enough, now know that they have been the victims of a serious confidence trick; that the position as represented to them by the Australian Labor Party last year and specifically in the Labor Leader’s policy speech, a copy of which I hold in my hand, was not borne out but was rejected in the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must bear in mind what this Government said in order to get itself elected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there has been one outstanding confidence trick it is that the Labor Party failed to say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it was going to remove by the dozens many valued policies that had been implemented over the past decade by the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret that the interest created by the report has not been greater because this is one subject which should concern the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He stated in his amendment that we should add to the formal words of thanks to the Governor-General for his Speech the following words expressing the opinion of the Senate: but the Senate is of the opinion and regrets that - The Government in its conduct of the nation’s affairs has subordinated the security and welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on whose behalf it should govern to the factional decisions of the Conference and Executive of the Australian Labor Party, in that: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the sort of government which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are now experiencing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to a frank, full and complete statement of all that has been happening and the reasons for it, because it is only something which is stated and which can be tested which is likely to give confidence to those who feel that Australia’s intelligence network is being dismantled in a way which will be disastrous ultimately to the security of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We believe that by the removal of that renunciation principle, which was a unanimous recommendation of the citizenship committee to the Minister in January of this year, we are acting on the unanimous advice of that committee and on the advice of the Department in accordance with the wishes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and in accordance with the wishes of many people who would become naturalised Australian citizens but for the fact that they have to renounce the citizenship of their original homeland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think we should be perturbed that the Attorney-General has been prepared so lightly to brush aside compliance with the legal requisitions, supporting this only with the proposition that surely the authority for this title springs from the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Attorney-General in our submission has brushed aside the requirements of the law in pursuance of this general philosophic proposition that all power rises from the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will greatly benefit from the guidance of the Federal Treasurer and his colleagues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may be a change which one could argue would be to the good, in relation to the capital flow, but recently the London stock market, which incidentally is a larger market than the whole Australian stock market, has said that the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are faced with a proposition of being not wanted in that field of trade of our prime stocks which at one stage was a very valuable partner for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These matters lead us to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that such policies will drastically reduce the purchasing power of all Australiansworkers, superannuitants, pensioners and the young people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This ought to be a clear warning to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Labor Government intends more and more punitive measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is running away from those measures which are available to it and which, if carried out, could reduce inflation without great hurt to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If  Senator Rae  and some of his colleagues who sit on the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange were to hurry up and present their report the reasons why the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have lost confidence in the activities of the stock exchange would be shown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In July a Commonwealth Government Loan was supported by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It expressed the confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know the number of ways that this Government feels that it can diminish the private sector and expand the public sector without somewhat disastrous effects on our economy in general, but it seems to me that the program of social concern, educational opportunities and all those things which we wish to do for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can come only from a confident and efficient private sector and one which is generating national economic growth which can be distributed in the great programs which we regard as important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the reasons why the Opposition has brought forward at this time a motion of urgencyto focus the attention of the Senate and, I believe, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on the need for sound policy judgment regarding economic management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is rather strange to hear people such as  Senator Carrick  saying that the Labor Government intends to impose more punitive measures on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The combination of the failure to implement policy, the dismantling of the homes savings grant and the raising of interest rates by 1 per cent or 2 per cent are so bad that the effect upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the future of home ownership could be quite disastrous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a confidence trick on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that they should have been pursuaded that inflation was of such little moment that that was the only reference that the Government thought fit to incorporate in the speech presented to this Parliament as we approached our legislative responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whichever of those reasons is selected as being responsible, it is obvious that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are now developing a very deep concern about where this nation is going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is not good enough and for that  Mr Whitlam  will have to answer to the people and for that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will pass judgment on him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, adverting to this Budget, to the election promises and to the parliamentary protestations about the program and performance of the Government, will very quickly gain an acute awareness of the Government in Canberra today and that when the opportunity arises they will seize that opportunity and, in view of the Government’s performance, dismiss the Government as it deserves to be dismissed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the events of recent days, including the varying decisions on the Galston airport site, possible referendums and interest rates, is it to be understood by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that decisions made and announced by the executive government- that is the Cabinet- of this country are to be regarded only as tentative at the point of announcement and liable to be reversed or altered by the Labor Caucus? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here I refer to latent costs that will cause increased pressures on the pockets of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, in every profession and every trade, could be persuaded to resist the temptation to ask for more money in their pay envelopes, if they could be persuaded to put in an extra, say, 2 hours work a week at full productive capacity, and if wages could be kept at the same level, even for 12 months, I suggest that the inevitable result would be a lowering of the prices of commodities in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general quality of life of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> has been enriched under the Labor Government much more than it has ever been enriched before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When in opposition we did not hesitate to make it clear to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that we intended to redirect those priorities and that we intended to concentrate in the areas which had been neglected for so many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not expect governments to ignore inflation or to welcome it as a solution to economic problems caused by a failure to face up to reality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The central proposition of the proposal that I made then and make now is that the proper management of the Federal system is critical to the future of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that governments should work together in a co-operative federalist style to achieve the best results for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I then suggested that if all this were done by a group of governments dealing with the one group of people- all Australians- and with the one allocation of total available resources we might begin to do a useful job for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have more faith in the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I merely ask any fair-minded senator: Do you consider that it is an argument against Australia’s taking action against China that the winds will blow the nuclear fallout over Asian people and not over <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These are elective processes and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to know what are the risks, what are the additional units of radiation that they absorb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Prior to the last election the Prime Minister told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that if a Labor Government were elected he would give an immediate increase of $1.50 a week to pensioners and then would give an increase of $1.50 a week every spring and autumn until the pension rate reached at least 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a measure which I believe will receive the endorsement and support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when it is put to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intention is to publicise government activities so that a wide cross-section of the Australian community will become aware of its rights, entitlements and responsibilities, the Government’s responsibilities, how those responsibilities are being fulfilled and the overall functions of government insofar as they relate to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be directly for the basic purpose of providing information to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as is done by the governments of the United States of America, Canada and the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That will enable the public and other government departments and instrumentalities to become aware of the services being provided by the Department for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- for example, Film Australia, the Australian Government Publishing Service, the Australian Government Advertising Division and the Australian Information Service- and of how they may avail themselves of those services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They also play a role in providing information of real value to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is one salient and obvious truth which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> accept, it is that if you are going to increase wages, then your employer who has to pay those wages will pass on the increase in some way, and the way in which he usually passes it on is by increasing the prices that he charges the consumers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very next debate in the Senate will be on the question of whether we ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to put the tools to fight inflation in the hands of a Federal Governmentany federal government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was only coincidental that the hot breath of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> was on its neck and it was facing an election in a few months time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He was challenged before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and he squibbed it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was done as a straight out bribe to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we intend to do, in addition to all the things we have done in 9 months- we have shown more initiative in 9 months than the previous Government did in 23 years- is go to the final masters, the final judges in all of these things- the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- to ask them to give us authority to write permanently into the Constitution of Australia the powers for this Government and future governments to deal with the whole question of prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government that went out of office on 2 December last always had the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at hean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Poyser that no member of the Opposition would oppose increased welfare benefits being given to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He and other honourablle senators are always prepared to stand up and criticise the situation in which the Government finds itself after having inherited 23 years of inflation, 23 years of misrule and 23 years of inability to find a proper resource allocation policy for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition parties recognised that that was a feature of every Budget that they produced before this Parliament and before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since it is the Government’s desire to give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the earliest possible opportunity to determine by referendum whether the Australian Parliament should be able to control prices in this way, we believe that standing order 242 should be suspended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government, following that precedent set by previous anti-Labor governments, now seeks to set aside this standing order in order that we can get this very urgent Bill through the Senate and have the matter determined by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Senate that stands between the centralist power-hungry socialist party that now controls the Federal Government and the liberties of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the Labor Party allows its socialist centralist dogma to over-ride sensible economic judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before anyone can endorse the Government’s proposal, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to more information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is lacking is the will on the part of the Australian Government and its leader to make such a conference a success, a leader who does not even have the support of his own Party could not expect the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister, the head of this Government, is misleading and deceiving the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is ruinous for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and the Liberal Party will not participate in deceiving the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as this Government is trying to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> give price control power to this Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the course of his speech in opposition to the second reading of the Constitution Alteration (Prices) Bill which was introduced by the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  yesterday seeking referral to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for a referendum on the control of prices, not only did he say that he opposed price control being imposed but also that he was against letting the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> determine by referendum whether there should be price control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those honourable senators are now saying to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> through their spokesman in this Parliament that not only are they opposed to price control but also they do not want the people to have a say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But while honourable senators know that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are concerned about the price structure they have refused, by their remarks this evening and by the manner in which they have chosen to oppose Government legislation, to give the people the right by way of popular vote to say yea or nay whether they want to give this Parliament-not the Government but this Parliament- power over prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a very genuine attempt by the Government to refer the seeking of approval for parliamentary control over prices to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Knowing that they have that protection, they still set out to refuse the Australian Government the right merely to ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to determine for themselves whether the Australian Parliament should control prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate came into the chamber tonight and said: ‘No, do not let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> determine this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chifley Labor Government in 1948 referred a matter, with the approval of the Australian Parliament, to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time the then Opposition in the House of Representatives and in the Senate opposed this matter being referred to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But apparently that Parliament must have been more democratic than this one because at least the matter was put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this occasion the Opposition is refusing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the right to determine this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the smear tactics and fear campaign in which the then Opposition engaged- apparently the present Opposition is trying to parrot it now, unfortunately the referendum was not carried by a majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in a majority of the Australian States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply say that had that proposal been accepted at that referendum in 1948- we do not query the decision of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; at least they had an opportunity to express themselvesthis country would not have the problem of inflation that we have today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1 949 the Liberal and Country Parties sought a mandate and were given a mandate by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to put value back into the pound. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the spending was to no avail because at long last the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had woken up to the then Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the gravamen of their objection to this Bill is that they oppose the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> being given the opportunity to express, by referendum, their opinion, as to whether or not the democratically elected Parliament of Australia should have constitutional power over prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If inflation is of concern to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as was said last week by the Opposition and as was reiterated in a repeat performance this afternoon, then I think that prices have been of concern to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for many years- long before this Government came into office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is about time the Opposition determined that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have the right to express themselves by way of popular vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> regret is that this factor was not recognised by the new Government when it came into office in all its glory and newness after the dictatorship in the early part of December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, in considering why the Opposition is opposing this Bill on their behalf, will realise that in the national Government which is not yet a year old there is no solidarity, there is no unified thought and there is no cohesive view of what should be done in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has set up the Prices Justification Tribunal, it has set up the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Prices which will report tomorrow; it has imposed a 25 per cent cut in tariffs; it has revalued the currency; and it has acted on the issue which is presently before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now we want to ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to give us a power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must be made aware of the fact that this is not the old style Labor governments that we have known in the past- those led by men like Ben Chifley and John Curtin, and a lot earlier by Andrew Fisher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is our responsibility to investigate this measure before we involve the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in another spending spree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find that the power which is sought needs a great deal of definition and a great deal of time for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to consider exactly what this power may do and the way in which it could be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the way in which this Bill is being dealt with in the national Parliament does not permit consideration of the lack of information which has been given to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what I suggest the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ought to consider when they hear  Senator Willesee  say that the present inflationary problems were created by the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it quite incredible that the Prime Minister, having created all this turbulent chaos in the economy, should ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to put into the hands of politicians the power to control prices in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have learned their lesson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be divided; that they should be put to the humbug and worry of a referendum on such a frivolous thing as the control of prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no wonder that 25 years ago the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, having experienced these conditions, overwhelmingly rejected such a proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder if he was expecting to rush it through so that it would come suddenly upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and take them unawares and that they would be frightened into making some sort of snap judgment and a hasty decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He stressed that it is his belief that the measure will receive the endorsement and support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I warn that the Government is trying to lead the nation into a situation in which, instead of sound management, good business administration and an economic policy which will create a good standard and quality of living for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the Government is seeking control that will be rigid and restricted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have said once before that they will not have a bar of price control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here was the man who then went to Caucus and by abject abdication of leadership put himself into the situation where he is now going to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with the most preposterous proposition that has ever been put by any Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is going to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to say: ‘I want you to put in our hands a great centralised power of one word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have expressed themselves in no uncertain terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That newspaper expresses the sentiments of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever happens on the Government side happens in the glare of publicity and according to a reasonable democratic process which, I think, is admired by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and which has been part of our history for the whole of this century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short we have provided for the Government the opportunity on which, if it chooses to avail itself of the provisions of section 57 of the Constitution, it may go to the Governor-General and ask for a double dissolution and thereby put its record to the judgment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the reintroduction of the Bill, the Government demonstrates its determination to adhere to its policies, as announced before the last election, and to which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> gave their stamp of approval on 2 December last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present situation is an intolerable one, where certain sovereign States claim the right to prevent Australia’s own High Court from adjudicating in Australia on an issue of sovereignty which is the sole concern of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and their nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He sought the cooperation of the Opposition in respect of it, and the Opposition was prepared to co-operate and is prepared to co-operate to ensure that the provisions of the legislation work in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the persons with whom the provisions of the legislation are most directly concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These benefit payments are contributed by these average <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a tragedy if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, who are to benefit by this legislation, are to lose the benefit of a result of further economic mismanagement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am annoyed when the patriotism of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is used for political purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is supposed to be a prices Act, but that is not altogether an accurate description, and I raise for the Committee’s attention the question whether it is fair to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to suggest that the word ‘prices’ should be the word which covers so many things which may be comprehended by the use of the word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How then can it be supposed that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will agree to a referendum proposal which until approximately 9 days ago was something which the Labor Party said it would not have a bar of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it makes a mockery of the prices justification legislation which was introduced earlier this year, because if the Commonwealth Government did not have the power to pass that legislation, what does it mean by imposing a fraud upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by suggesting that legislation of that character could be efficacious? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to the Senate that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will reject this proposition for 8 main reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will reject this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A third reason is that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be entitled to conclude on all evidence on all sides that the granting of this power and its use is not in itself the answer to the problem of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that we will get on with the job in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and that we will do it rapidly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very often we cannot tell whether a referendum will go through because there is a caution in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when it comes to fiddling around with the Constitution which was given such a great deal of thought when it was first created. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the very existence of that house of review ensures that any legislation that may be introduced by a majority government in the House of Representatives must have time to mature and to become known to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> before it is debated in the second chamber, which is the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, I am confident that the Australian Labor Party will never be given power over prices in the Federal sphere while the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have the right to deny the Labor Party that power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the solution which hasbeen offered now, althouth it may not be theone which was totally acceptable to us, is atleast reasonably acceptable to us and is acceptable to the Government, and it rests within thedisposition of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as to whetherthey confer on the national Parliament both powers, neither power or one power or the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We leave it to the good sense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Bill- the Constitution Alteration (Prices) Bill having passed a little earlier- is passed by the Senate before the Parliament rises this week, and we hope that it will now be passed this evening, both proposals can be submitted together to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for their decision before Christmas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want the inflation rate stopped now- not in 6 months time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as this matter has been raised by the Opposition I think it is worth while taking a little time to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Opposition that in fact the percentage of the Australian gross national product now being spent by this Government on defence is greater than the percentage of the gross national product spent by the previous Government in any financial year between 1959 and 1963- and it was very little higher than the present figure at any stage during the life of the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it did nothing else, the role that it played in ending the Vietnam war and the role that it played in seeing that sensible relations exist between this country and China, Vietnam and East Germany would be abiding memorials to this Government and of permanent benefit to the peace of the world and the security of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that what I am saying is of great significance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because in the past the Senate has been used to the detriment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and I want to ensure that this is not allowed to continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is very concerned about the social welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and rightly so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These, very generally stated, are that the functions of the National Library are, working on behalf of the Commonwealth, to maintain and develop a national collection of library material, including a comprehensive collection of library material relating to Australia and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; to make library material available and to provide for the advantageous use of any collections in the Library in the national interest; to make available such other services in relation to library matters and library material for the purposes of the Parliamentary Library, the departments and authorities of the Commonwealth and the Territories of the Commonwealth; and finally to cooperate in library matters, including the advancement of library science, with authorities or persons, whether in Australia or elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an urgent need to bring together all the factors which are involved and all of those to which I have referred so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will have the benefit of the services which are now well established and widely distributed on the international level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what is involved in the great confidence trick which this Government is seeking to impose upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These public reports will serve as a standard by which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be able to judge the Government’s performance in the social welfare area having regard to the information provided and the recommendations made to it in the Commission’s reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: In view of the importance of ascertaining and publishing the true facts for proper assessment by the Parliament and by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, will the Federal Government produce as a matter of some urgency a White Paper or a considered statement in particular, clarifying the repeated allegations that the Allende Government in the latter part of its period of office had abandoned democratic processes, the basis of its election, and was imposing dictatorial and totalitarian methods upon the Chilean people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this type of discrimination is part of the reason why this referendum will never succeed in securing the vote of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is this type of hypocrisy, this type of misleading approach, this virtual fraud on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by stating arguments which cannot be sustained, which I believe is right at the heart of what must be said about this incomes referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the overwhelming majority of employers and employees who operate under the present conciliation and arbitration system desire to retain that system and to make it work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the reason the Government has not reintroduced the Bill is because it recognises that the points made by the Opposition had validity, and there was a realistic recognition that if those points of validity were not accepted by the Government they would be accepted by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know that any special steps have been taken officially by the government to educate the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as to what is happening in this country with respect to multi-nationals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As part of the democratic process the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled at least to have the program which they endorsed carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this is a consequence of long hours when we become physically and mentally tired, and it is not in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from the point of view of our being their legislators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is not in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that we should do nothing, or limit our own powers in trying to hold our own a little more effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This objective, I believe, is supported by over 90 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an opportunity here for the ordinary citizen to share in the kind of capital appreciation which so far has been confined to a very small percentage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view it stands to the credit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that through time they have achieved this result so adequately and so peacefully. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure it is not perfect, but set against other examples of administration of countries by overseas powers in what might be called a colonial style- I never cared for it but, never mind, we had a kind of guardianship situation in Papua New Guinea- I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> performed the function well, they discharged it with dignity, they dug fairly deeply into their own pockets to fund the development of Papua New Guinea, and I think that it stands to our credit both with the people of Papua New Guinea and with ourselves, and it certainly stands to our credit with the United Nations and those observers who have been to Papua New Guinea from time to time to witness the progress of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can pass through that gateway with very great dignity and honour, and I believe that the people of the new country can enter the gateway with great prospects for a future which is much brighter with promise than it might have been under an administration of a different character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In effect, the Government is pledging Australia’s credit to a new and independent State, and it is a mark of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s confidence and willingness to stay in the game of Papua New Guinea that they will give such guarantees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a further mark in my mind to the credit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in all their relations with the emerging independent nation of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that they cannot sell their properties there shows, that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> certainly do not want to start farming in that territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are they again misusing their licences to push their own political beliefs and to stop the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> witnessing the triumphs of this Labor Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have always considered that our prime duty and responsibility was adequately to scrutinise legislation and administrative acts and, having done that, then to vote accordingly and to express what we think is the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in our vote in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the Senate to delay this Bill, in my view, is an act of economic sabotage against the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and honourable senators opposite stand condemned, and they will stand condemned in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, for their delaying tactics in relation to this important piece of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Tonight we are being denied the right to carry legislation for which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> gave us a mandate in December of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister not agree that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be given the chance to determine whether they wish to retain the present national anthem? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister be prepared to lay on the table of the Senate the agreement by which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are secured in the action of the Australian Government paying for this enormous amount of steel imported from Japan and from local suppliers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that it should be underlined as the basis of my amendment and what I believe is the feeling of the majority .of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to get to the nitty gritty of this and I think it is essential from this Parliament’s point of view and from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s point of view that a settlement of the Middle East issue be brought about and maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that this Government has a role to play on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If all commercial broadcasting and television licensees adopted that attitude, the cost to a political party in getting its message to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be completely prohibitive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The era when government was seeking to gain political advantage by fomenting troubles with other countries has gone, and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are thankful that it has gone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Ultimately the choice, which is a choice for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, will become a choice made on better information than would otherwise be the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that for all the satisfaction which <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can take from the way in which the Prime Minister personally conducts himself, they will have a very real apprehension as to these unanswered questions in our relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have improved the standard of living of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by making it possible for Australia to enter into trade arrangements with these countries in a way in which the previous Government was completely incapable of doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to know what kind of discussions ensued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first thing that I believe has to be said- this has to be repeated- is that the policy which has been put forward in the Schools Commission Bill 1973 is Australian Labor Party policy which was well known and clearly presented to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> before they voted in the election on 2 December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any proposition which was put forward by way of amendment or any other way which suggested that this responsibility did not exist and that there was just a general responsibility to students would be contrary to the policy on which we were elected, contrary to the trust which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> reposed in us and contrary to the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who voted for this policy when they elected the Labor Government on 2 December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have already taken steps by announcing the proposed members of the Schools Commission, if this Bill is passed, to show to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Parliament- so that nobody is being misled- who are the people who will be serving on this Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that this policy is something which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> supported and which they are entitled to receive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These matters typify the kind of thinking on which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can be congratulated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be proud that over many years the Commonwealth has paid close attention to the deprivation that has occurred in these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Having been a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and Welfare which inquired at length into the problems of the physically and mentally handicapped, I echo the remarks of  Senator Jessop  when I say frankly that I am very proud that the Government of which I am a member has taken heed of the very detailed and voluminous report which was arrived at collectively and unanimously by the members of that Committee, who were of all political persuasions, after they had taken evidence at length from a large cross-section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who represent the physically and mentally handicapped section, particularly the handicapped children, in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Can the Minister for Foreign Affairs tell me the exact cost to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the Murray Grey bull that was presented to the Red Chinese Government and also the exact cost to transport the beast to China? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to functions, what we have put forward is wholly in line with the Karmel Committee’s recommendations and its philosophy and, I believe, wholly in line with the aspirations of the great majority if not the totality of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In seeking Australian Government control and direction of our fuel resources, I have been concerned naturally to reduce our dependency on Middle East crude and this concern is reflected in the provisions of the Pipeline Authority Act 1 973 requiring the Authority to secure, control and retain reserves of petroleum adequate to meet the long term needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-59-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Prime Minister agree that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be given the chance to determine whether or not they wish to retain the present National Anthem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-59-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is not the Government’s intention, I ask: Why were such policy announcements made in Japan thousands of miles away and not to the Australian Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is understandable and supportable by me at least because I am a great believer in the National Library for the use of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is robbing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of their savings and of their spending power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are an <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and there is no reason why we cannot have an international outlook on such things as art, but I believe that primarily the national Parliament should encourage the development of Australian artists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we find that during next year  Mr Whitlam  wants some other matters referred to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister assure the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that no decision of the Government will result in harm to a vital industry or result in unemployment in that industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not sure of the exact number but I understand that some sample has been selected of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, no doubt by the usual sampling methods so that if the figure is 60,000 it will fairly represent the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means that a decision can be made by a representative sample which will give a true indication of the general opinion of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that the sample will give sufficient indication of the clear view of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps I should have given prioity to Parliament House itself, which is becoming a Mecca for nearly all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and particularly for children who feel that it is part of their education to come to Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What a strange kind of government it is that inveighs against multi-nationals- what an ugly word the Government has made thatand then proceeds, by tariff cuts, to destroy Australian industries and to force <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to buy goods from multi-national and foreignnational companies which are established and maintained wholly overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because there has been a substantial increase in the number of broadcasting stations and television stations and because the workload now thrown on the Broadcasting Control Board is significantly greater than it was a decade ago, it is only natural that an increase in the revenue required to enable the Broadcasting Control Board to continue to give the very effective service that it gives to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am confident they will have the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To put it in other terms, unless this chamber is prepared to rubber stamp entirely that which the Minister requires, the Minister will not go on with what is regarded by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and apparently by the lower House- and this would be the majority view of this chamber- as something which is desirable in the interests of education of Australia, that is, the creation of a schools commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One finds repetition after repetition of these deceptive statements which have created considerable confusion in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are grateful for that and I agree with one point made by  Dr J.  F. Cairns on Sunday, that is, that if there was an election the Government would not win. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Senate has the same constraints placed upon it as the House of Representatives and the Government have, that is, the constraint of the wishes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who are our masters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are commonly believed to be jealous of their freedoms and to be strongly opposed to government interference in their lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that that as a wording of the first function of the Commission is more desirable, more comprehensive and more in accord with both the recommendations of the Karmel Committee and the desires of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and of the State governments- which are, as we have mentioned already, directly concerned with the administration of so much of the education in Australia- than is the provision drafted by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We now have a government and a Minister seeing to it that these resources are developed in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and used in their interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a time of world energy crisis that is exactly what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would expect of their Government and the Minister, and that is exactly what is happening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the 20 years looking at the economy in a certain style which might be called, I suppose, an open market economy style, we see that great financial restraint was taken by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is something which much be resolved by a co-operative arrangement between the Commonwealth and the State governments or by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> through an amendment of the Constitution in the ordinary way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It shows the complete absurdity of this legislation and the complete ignorance of members of this Government and certainly the Minister who does not seem to be able to look beyond the interests of his coal kingdom in Wollongong when he thinks that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believe that the laws to cover these vast areas of Australia should be made by applying the law of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Not only does the Government want to strip the States of all power as has been indicated in different legislation which has been before this chamber, but also on Saturday week at a referendum the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have to decide whether this Australian Parliament and Government will be given full control over prices and wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What will it mean if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> support the referendum on prices? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian living standards over a long period of years have been based upon Australian growth which has been supported in 2 ways- firstly, very substantially by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by way of reinvestment in their own country and secondly by the augmentation of capital and know-how from overseas, and that must not be forgotten in what might be called an excess of economic nationalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also ought not be forgotten that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> traditionally nave a very high rate of savings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a start, we are very concerned about the form of compulsion envisaged in the legislation which we regard as foreign to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want that, despite the Government’s saying that it believes they do or that the Government has a mandate to do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe the Government has a mandate for it at all, and I do not believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The life offices hold substantial quantities of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ‘s savings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that is a fairly reasonable and rational statement of concern by the life offices, which as I said earlier, hold a huge amount of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s savings- the savings of literally millions of people, most of whom have invested small amounts of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What it will do is divert the savings of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from the traditional areas to other areas which may be less attractive and less safe, and in the end there may be less total benefit to the Australian community as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The AIDC equally could be required to divest itself as soon as practicable, of many of its investments and they should be sold to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> through the normal process of buying and selling in the market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people will have access to a huge resource- a huge proportion of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s savings- and the economic consequences of their investment programs may be much less important to them than would be shown in the kind of approach that would be made to investment by the people who are currently on the Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government decides that it wants something done and some part of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s savings used to do it and if the proposal is not regarded as a good commercial operation and no one else will touch it-the AIDC may not want to do it, but the Government could say: ‘You have to do it’- the Government should be responsible for that decision, that money, and what happens to that money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But here is a proposition which will take up a very great part of the savings of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and set them to one side free from scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an area like this one thing should be implicit if we want the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s confidence and if we want to attract more money to a government investment corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not yet necessarily sure that the whole proposal will benefit the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should not ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to take this responsibility and it should not ask the life assurance policy holders or the savings banks people or the provident funds people to do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not here to interpret the Prime Minister’s words, but I think it may be fair to say that in this instance the Prime Minister was voicing the viewpoint that would be shared by most of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that is, that the pilots would be expected to exercise common sense, that where a safety issue was raised it would be dealt with in the normal and proper way under the procedures which are laid down by law, and that the pilots would resume and carry on their duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have moved this motion to enable discussion on this matter in the Senate today because I believe it raises the most fundamental problem that is facing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again, in the case of the arts there is not a concentration of arbitrary power in the hands of ministers or permanent heads of departments, but an effort to bring broad sections of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from the fields in which they are interested and active into consultation with the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it an arbitrary or excessive power to introduce legislation such as the Trade Practices Bill in order to break down the power of economic monopolies and oligopolies which rule the economic life of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; to see that the people can participate in a private enterprise economy, which we still have, on a basis of some equality, or to remove a situation in which there is not government regulation but regulation by private monopolies about which the previous Government said it was going to do something but about which it did nothing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it arbitrary and excessive power to introduce a Bill to provide for a charter of human rights for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that one reason for the failure of the present Government to take advantage of the opportunity which we have given it for a double dissolution is this: The Government knows that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are appalled at the power hungry character of the Government in Canberra and it is not game to go to the people to get their verdict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What honourable senators opposite are complaining about is that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> since 2 December have had an activist government which wishes to make available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> all the fruits of the opportunities which nature has given them- a government which wishes to make them available to the people of this country untrammelled by sellouts to overseas companies which was par for the course during the previous Government’s day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are using the powers which were given to us and we will continue to use those powers and to extend them as far as the Constitution will allow in order that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> may have good and active governmentnot a government of the kind they have had over the past 23 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These have not been to the detriment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and they are not the result of the actions of so-called power drunk bureaucrats here in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> whether all these things which I have enumerated regarding social welfare, education and so on have been achieved as a result of the rapid concentration of excessive and arbitrary powers in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, those ways might embody social principles and philosophies which would be alien to the views of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be that other methods, other formulae, which do not have these overtones and cause apprehension and concern, may be discovered which would substantially giver effect to what is the commonly held desire of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, namely, that as far as possible we should maximise Australian control and ownership of our resources and at the same time not deter the investment of foreign capital in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, after all those things, he is in any doubt I suggest that the honourable senator look at the Minister’s second reading speech, which will probably be made tomorrow night, on the introduction of the Health Insurance Bill which will be of great benefit to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when enacted by this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those laws may be made over the years by the various governments representing the various shades of political opinion and responding to what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want them to do over presumably a very lengthy period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is to be a referendum of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on 8 December which is designed to give this Government more power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> fall for the 3-card trick they have nobody else to blame but themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Previously this problem was not thrust on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But the maps show that it is envisaged that a grid will be built throughout Australia, for which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be encouraged to provide the finance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this legislation, when passed, will make available to the Government the moneys required for purposes mainly outlined in a Labor Government’s first Budget to be presented to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for approximately 20 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is it that there are 67,000 people who apparently the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have to support on a fairly high level of unemployment benefits? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think for a moment that any benefit is incurred by anybody- the worker or the people of Australia as a whole- by this humbug that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should own their own industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What possible benefit can it confer upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> if their industries are owned, operated and run by the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then went on to say that the Federal Government had adequate powers to ensure that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were protected against foreign control without banning or limiting foreign investment in particular projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me remind people that much of the export generated prosperity of this nation has been achieved for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by our primary producers, in particular by the wool and wheat producers who are often the same producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: In view of the importance of ascertaining and publishing the true facts for proper assessment by the Parliament and by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, will the Federal Government produce as a matter of some urgency a White Paper or a considered statement in particular, clarifying the repeated allegations that the Allende Government in the latter part of its period of office had abandoned democratic processes, the basis of its election, and was imposing dictatorial and totalitarian methods upon the Chilean people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators opposite face up to the matter, the brutal truth is that they are opposing the wishes of the Australian Government and the House of Representatives to let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> exercise their right under the Constitution to vote on whether the constitution should be changed in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition hopes that the Government will accept our amendments so that the proposal for giving electors in the territories the right to vote at referenda may be put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with the support of the Australian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition clearly is thwarting the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as expressed by them in the ballot box on 2 December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless, this is probably the most important Bill that the Government has introduced since it was given a mandate to govern by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on 2 December last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Government from giving effect to its undertakings which received the support ofthe <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been hoodwinked by the Government’s propaganda that has stated that we are attempting to take $1 14m from the State schools and from other schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security now in a position to inform the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> whether the compulsory payment of 1.3S per cent of taxable income proposed to finance the Health Insurance Bill 1973 will itself be tax deductible? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such resources as we have- in some fields they are meagre and in other fields they are vast-are clearly going to be used to the advantage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: In view of the decisive defeat of the proposals put at last Saturday’s referendum, is it still proposed to persevere with the other 4 referendum proposals which obviously would be more repugnant to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> than those on incomes and prices? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let me say that Bills on education, on workers’ compensation- and, it is contemplated, on national insurance, on the right of access to the Australian Loan Council by local authorities, on matters affecting inflation, on referendums- the present Prime Minister and the GovernorGeneral indicated three or four matters which were to go before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by way of referendum proposals- on the Australian Industries Development Corporation and on industrial matters, all of which could be regarded as cornerstones of the Government’s policies, have in one way or another been put aside, amended, rejected or deferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the months that lie ahead the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will have to take into very serious consideration the fact that after 23 years in government the present Opposition Parties, which were defeated at the polls, have taken advantage of a temporary situation that exists in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is only the Liberal Party senators plus the Country Party senators plus the Democratic Labor Party senators that stand between the exercising of arbitrary centralist socialist power in Canberra and the freedoms of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not like central management from Canberra; they prefer the people who live next to them, local governing people, and they trust them more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At long last we are going to put the rights of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> before the interests of any other government in the world, irrespective of which government it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This program is an indication of the enthusiasm and earnestness of the Interim Committee in tackling its responsibilities, and indicates the wholehearted approach and the concern for the health care of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Commission will bring to bear on its tasks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also aims to preserve the dignity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, their total freedom of choice in medical and hospital care, their personal privacy and to maintain the present quality of Australian health care which is recognised as being as high as any existing in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I, as the representative of the Government, need to say is that my colleagues join me in appreciating that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will now not be deprived of the Australian Schools Commission which, prior to the last Federal election, the Labor movement undertook to establish if and when we were elected to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There will be clearly a reduction in the standard of care available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite confident that the average Australian finds costs escalating quite sharply enough as a result of the other actions of this Government without having forced on to him a huge escalation in total costs of a health scheme which has been partially worked out and many times altered; a scheme which can be described only as unsatisfactory to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and which will reduce the standard of health care whilst increasing the costs of health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Hayden  ‘s estimate is that 87 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are now covered by health insurance, but I think if we consider what I will say we will see that that is not a correct estimate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present, 79 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are covered by private health insurance, 10 per cent are covered by pensioner medical services, and approximately 3 per cent are covered by subsidised health benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Mr Hayden  wishes to direct attention towards covering the uncovered, he would have our full support, but instead he is attacking the freedom of choice of Australians and upsetting the arrangements made and approved by an overwhelming majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will have a vast nationwide computer data bank storing medical information on all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No attitude has been made more clear in recent times than that of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in relation to the health scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But honourable senators opposite have refused to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- they have not told them tonight- about the benefits that will be reaped by way of refunds to the persons who contribute by way of a taxation levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that it is in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the motions I have moved for the second reading of these Bills should be agreed to by the Senate and the legislation enacted so that the Government can get down to the task of providing proper, decent, reasonable and just medical services to all sections of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While the Liberal Party of Australia does not condone the apartheid policy of South Africa and Rhodesia, like all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> it is appalled at the Australian Prime Minister openly advocating violence and terror. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his policy speech last November, the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  said that the Australian Labor Party was determined that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be restored to their rightful place in their own country, as the owners and keepers of the national estate, and the nation’s resources, and as fair and equal sharers in the national wealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government believes that the creation of the Petroleum and Minerals Authority for the purposes I have outlined reflects the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and will be applauded by them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I considered whether there should be provision for compulsory reconciliation conferences between the spouses, as there are in other countries, but rejected the notion as being unacceptable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> need and desire a health insurance scheme which automatically and fairly covers all Australians against the costs of health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-9-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am also given to understand that the writer of the article urged the Australian Government to take other initiatives in the health area which would enable the Government to implement the policy for which it secured a mandate from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If it has not done so will the Minister express the abhorrence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the method by which these executions were carried out, a method which involves placing a spiked collar around the prisoner’s neck and then tightening the instrument - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless, what I have said about the attitude of the Australian Government represents, I think, the overwhelming attitude of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the most horrible chapters in the whole of Australian history has been put to an end by this Government and put to an end by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, one of whose major reasons for voting for the Australian Labor Party was the realisation that for years they had been misled and that a completely incorrect and immoral course had been taken in regard to Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Regarding the Middle East problem the Australian Government has said- with the support of the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, I believe- that it will take up an even-handed position towards the Middle East conflict, that we shall not from the beginning as it were identify ourselves with either of the parties to this dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know that  Senator Willesee  as Minister for Foreign Affairs on 2 occasions condemned the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for banishing that colleague. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Perhaps he was indiscreet, but it is on record as the attitude of the Opposition to legislation that has been introduced for the advancement of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has been trying to protect the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>failed to fulfil the expectations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because of its administrative incompetence’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Prime Minister who is at fault, and we can only appeal to him that, if he believes he has been unduly hindered by part of the legislature, he already has the means at his disposal to test whom the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who are our masters in the Senate inasmuch as they are also the Prime Minister’s masters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Liberal Party senators intend to carry out  Her  Majesty’s expressed desire, that is to fulfil to the utmost of our abilities the deep responsibility which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have placed upon us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were conned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are fortunate that in the Senate the Government cannot take action such as that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was so that he could deceive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by putting his words into the mouth of the Queen and by giving the Speech from the Throne the imprimatur of the Queen’s own action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Important measures affecting health, education, and consumer protection have been either rejected, delayed or put aside by these people who have bulldozed the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by their decision to oppose the implementation of the policies which the people adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That whereas our constitutional parliamentary democracy was clearly developed as a Federation to preserve for all time to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> their cherished right to live as free men and women, enjoying complete liberty of worship, assembly, speech, movement and the communication of knowledge and information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Opposition does not want to give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a say on this or other matters of constitutional reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event, I suggest that despite all the indignation that we have heard from senators opposite, theirs is an insincere and phoney argument based on a desire to avoid the judgment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and not on any devotion to democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, when we agree to put a question to the people we have to recognise the fact that it is costing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> money to put the question before them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Judging from the history of this country, I do not think that the putting of a question to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by way of a referendum should excite the government of the day very greatly because so often people who go forward with great enthusiasm for the questions being put find that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are very hard to move when it comes to changing the Australian Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  may have some ambitions and ideas about changing the Constitution, and despite the fact that he thinks the Constitution is not right because it does not suit him personally or politically, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally believe that under the Constitution, creaky as some might think it is, we have not done so badly after all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If further steps are taken and the question is put to the people, which is a course that the Government can follow, I certainly will do all I can to encourage the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to vote no in the referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 and a lot of other South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are confident that he will take his place in this Senate after 1 July next at the expense of some other honourable senator who is sitting here now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This program for the new session of the  twenth-eight  Parliament is seen by my Government as a continuation of the progressive policies of reform which it has pursued vigorously and unflaggingly since assuming office, and for which it has a clear mandate from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Her Majesty saw fit to repeat the words that this Government has a clear mandate from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly know that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not regard that meaning of ‘obstruction’ as the meaning which they have attributed to the word in times past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, in the long run, it becomes a question of supporting the proposals, then at least the measures will benefit in their presentation to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from the fact that consideration has meant a consensus and therefore a unanimity, if that is to be the result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Speech itself purports to have a message, that message lies in its penultimate paragraph which alleges that the Government has a program ‘for which it has a clear mandate from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I want to say and to demonstrate emphatically is that what purported to be a mandate from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in December 1972 is now exposed not as a mandate but as a confidence trick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By taking 25 individual mandates or so-called mandates, I want to expose 25 individual confidence tricks, because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and this Parliament in the coming months are to judge this Government on its performance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now invite the Senate and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to make a judgment on 25 mandates clearly sought and 25 confidence tricks clearly perpetrated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is the mandate to do this kind of raiding of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and what effect will it have on inflation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If in retrospect this situation had applied and had existed today, there would be no Senate election in 2 months time and no chance for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to judge this Government in mid-term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the Labor Party wishes to resist being judged and wishes to remove, as far as possible, the opportunities for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to sit in judgment and to restrain it, it wants to remove the separate Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More than a confidence trick was played on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government played the greatest deception upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when, instead of bringing those kinds of values of leadership, it brought a brawling, Rabelaisian, Bacchanalian kind of state- a state in which the individual is lost in the mob, in which violence is approved and encouraged, in which ordinary decent human values are lost, in which providence and restraint count for nothing, in which skill counts for nothing and in which the promotion comes only if one happens to know a Labor politician. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It deserves to be rejected wholly because it cheated the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report affects rural areas firstly and directly but it will affect the whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be a tremendous impost on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> if they are required to pay 10c to put a stamp on a letter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another matter which is distressing principally the housewife and the man in the street in Australia at the moment is one of the biggest con jobs ever put over the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- I do not blame this Government entirely for it- and that is the continuation of the metric system in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe that we, like Nelson’s fleet, at least have been able to stand between the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the arrogant abuse of dictatorial power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor, I believe, do they have the support of an overwhelming number of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the matter of greatest concern to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the present time is the inordinate degree of inflation now in existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the talk about overseas investment in Australia- to the effect that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should own an effective or controlling interest in the industries of this country- is in spite of the evidence to the contrary that there is insufficient capital to effect the development we want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, it has proved to be a good talking point, that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should own their own industries and resources and own them in the way that the British people have owned their industries, which has brought them to their knees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Treasurer announced in the presentation of his Budget in the Parliament last August that the Government, in accordance with its policies of open government and in genuine endeavour to inform the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, would be undertaking an extensive advertising campaign in order to inform the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the responsibilities of Parliament, the executive and government generally and also to inform the Australian community about the rights and privileges of Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us have an end to this idea that what  Mr Whitlam  and  Senator Murphy  want the Parliament must submit to, because in that lies the essential authoritarianism which is becoming so evident to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as the hallmark of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The presence in Australia of Your Majesty and of His Royal Highness the Prince Philip has once again brought the greatest pleasure to your <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It vitally affects the relationship between the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and their Houses of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I claim that we were fulfilling our constitutional obligation and our obligation to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What might the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> expect in the future if the Opposition meekly accepts the Government’s assertion that if a Bill is referred to a Senate committee it is a failure to pass? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate committees no longer operate to seek information and make recommendations for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because they are bound by the Labor Party’s Caucus decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The wishes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are of no account when Caucus runs riot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said previously, and I repeat that it is the Senate and the Senate alone which stands between the complete arbitrary power which is being sought by this Government and the individual rights and liberties of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, any attempt to destroy the Senate’s independence as a chamber, or any attempt that may appear to do that, should and must be closely examined for the good of the parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a sense that would not be an unreasonable thing because it would show over a period that that was the prevailing sentiment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a short time an opportunity will again be available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to decide whether the changes which have been occurring will reflect the pattern and the tenor of development into a longer period or whether they want to have the sureties, the certainties and the stability which did characterise the government which they had known for 23 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate has been able to ensure that the changes which are occurring are not changes which must be taken and accepted by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> over the long term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has permitted a pause- and when the next Senate election takes place there will be an indication for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as to whether of not they want the changes to be permanent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill has been introduced as a Bill by means of which the Prime Minister seeks to put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a referendum question at the same time as the Senate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sense from the way in which Government senators are responding that they recognise the fraud which is being perpetrated on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because of the way in which the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  has advanced his arguments in support of these proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate is debating a series of Bills that are designed to give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> an opportunity to express an opinion in respect of a number of matters which were dealt with by the House of Representatives during 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is argued by the Government that the mere adoption of these propositions by the House of Representatives and by this place does not in any way commit either House of the Parliament to the issues in question as they would automatically go forward in a referendum form to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has been chided by  Senator Greenwood  and other Opposition senators for not wasting the time of this Parliament by endeavouring to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about the merits of its arguments and policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will take the opportunity when the date for the holding of these referenda is set to explain to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the reasons why it believes these important changes should take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that if this Senate, firstly, and, subsequently, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are persuaded to change the Constitution this will change local government bodies and the structure of local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That has arisen because a Labor Government was elected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with a Prime Minister, a leader, who has consistently advocated that this should be the position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is before this obstructionist House for the second time because the Opposition has taken the view that we are not entitled to present this question properly to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for them to vote on the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might well be that honourable senators opposite will convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> not to support this proposition in the referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are quite happy for the Opposition to make a decision on the matter because we will then go out on the hustings and tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what we seek to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators should be aware that when we do go out on the hustings hundreds of people from local government bodies will be supporting- even if they do not understand all the other issues that will be placed before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- the endeavours of the Australian Labor Government to alter radically the whole financial relationships that exist between the Commonwealth, the States and local governments and semi-government bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In making this submission to the Convention, local government has as its objective changes which will allow local government authorities throughout Australia to make a greater contribution to the well-being of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Somehow the notion has arisen that this Opposition wants to arrogate to itself the right to prevent the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from voting to change their own Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government says: We want to ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> whether they want to empower their own Parliament to send money directly to local government’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will agree to your proposition to put these proposals to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will go out and we will ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to vote against them because we do not agree with them, but never would we deny the right of a government elected by the people to go to its own people and say ‘We, the Government of Australia, ask you to vote to change your Constitution in such and such a manner’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government subsequently disallowed the amendment in the House of Representatives and by so doing telegraphed to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that a vote to the Territories was merely chocolate coating on a bitter pill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a Bill which is a confidence trick sought to be worked on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My God, they will win with it if they can get it passed, but I have enough faith in the common sense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to know perfectly well that they will not get it passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me to be an endeavour to raise another bogy to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that no attempt should be made by any government to revise the Australian Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have to stress the fact that this Government has endeavoured to refer matters of constitutional change to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, not to make some back door arrangement, not to attempt to bypass public opinion, but rather to give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> an opportunity to have a 1970 look at the Constitution, which people should know is now well over 70 years old. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Carrick  quite rightly drew attention to the fact that there is a reluctance on the part of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to change the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No government would constantly put matters before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> if all the forebodings that  Senator Carrick  and  Senator Greenwood  suggested hold any water at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter which the Parliament is being asked to decide; and, finaly, it is a matter which will be placed before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This inevitability of all men failing to agree on important questions meant that the Prime Minister has had to take steps to put a Bill through the House of Representatives, meeting the very strict requirements of an absolute majority of both Houses of Parliament, which is one of the safeguards in the Constitution, then have the matter go through the due processes and ultimately to be placed before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would imagine that even when all those procedures are followed the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will act irresponsibly, in the view of those who have opposed these matters when they have been before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister is seeking to extend it, and I think I have indicated that in his desire to do this he will be recognised not only by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but ultimately by historians as a person who was prepared to go to the full extent of the democratic procedures to convince the Australian electorate to change the constitutional provisions relating to powers between the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of regret that members of the Opposition, for sheer political advantage, are endeavouring on every occasion to base their arguments upon the backwardness of attitudes that exist in the various States and among sections of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who still want to regard themselves not as part of one nation but as six different nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the Prime Minister ought to be recognised as a very courageous man for taking the steps that he has taken in a period of political difficulty, in this country, seeking to effect changes in the Constitution which after all, if agreed to, must still be determined by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and which would mean only a transference to the Commonwealth of powers that already exist at the State level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly we will have difficulty convincing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the need to agree to these matters that will go before them by referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless it is only right that the Government should have the opportunity to go to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and give them an opportunity to review the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let them defeat it if they must, but give us the opportunity to take it to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should have the opportunity to go out and talk to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to convince them that the time has arrived in Australia’s development for updating and modernising the Australian Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He acts as though we are using some brutal numbers- which of course we do not have here- to steamroller some proposition, to put something over the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when the reality is that what we have put before the Senate is a matter which already has been suggested to the States and which already has won the approval of the States in principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this does not indicate a paranoid determination by the Opposition to oppose all suggestions for change of the Constitution and to deprive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of their rightgiven to them under the Constitution- to pass judgment on proposals for alteration of the Constitution, I do not know what it does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe it will be able to produce some worthwhile amendments to the Constitution which could be expected io obtain the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact it is not necessary for specific examples to be cited because what we are in fact doing is providing the machinery so that in the eventuality of such laws being necessary they are available to both Australian and State governments for their mutual benefit and for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to co-operate with authorities, organisations and other persons in formulating proposals designed to ensure that the recovery of petroleum and minerals so available is carried on in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> having regard to the long term needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would see where their money went, if it were on a small basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this Government came into office, the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  gave an undertaking to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and particularly to those people on pensions, that we would move in Parliament each session for an increase of $1.50 a week until such time as the pension was 25 per cent of average weekly male earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, in the Budget session of last year the Government likewise moved to increase the pension by $1.50 a week in accordance with the mandate it received from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Government will be commended by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for the initiatives which it has taken in social reform in this country, especially so far as pensions are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are great courts, historic courts administering the law for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real aim of a government ought to be to ensure not only that we conserve and therefore not over-exploit our minerals but also that we extract them in the best way possible, we sell them on the best market possible and we obtain for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the maximum reward in terms of company tax, in employment, and in the general benefits that flow from the extraction and processing of minerals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were getting very good benefit from their oil industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1973, which was the first year in which the Labor Government was in office- the Government that said it could show the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> how to get oil and how it could drill wells- 551,400 feet of oil wells was drilled, which was slightly more than half the figure achieved in the previous year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The members of the Labor Party are the people who are denying the true interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the past 60 years these wicked multinationals, when given incentives, have provided the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with motor spirits and petroleum at almost the lowest prices in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Average Australian citizens, without any hesitation, would say ‘Oh yes, we believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should own their own resources’, until they start to think further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To go around, in regard to this measure and in regard to another measure that is before this chamber, preaching this song about how necessary it is for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to own their own resources and in the process of getting them back to automatically nationalise them is, in my opinion, a very snide trick indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me state quite unequivocally that the Bill has been drafted for the purpose of assisting the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Lillico,  who has just resumed his seat, would know this is probably the first government in 20-odd years that has set out to protect the rights of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is common knowledge- I think this bears repetition- that those companies which have made the most out of oil development in Australia have done so at the expense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We came out commending companies for their contribution in educating our <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the fields of exploration and the techniques for the recovery of hydrocarbons in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian National Airlines Commission or Trans-Australia Airlines has provided to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a service which I suppose is equal to that provided by any other airline in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only will the Bill establish this petroleum and minerals authority but it will also, in my view, set a pattern for and give a lead to the development of other Australian resources for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the interests of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are still a young country, and I think that it is beyond the present capacity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to contribute the millions of dollars necessary for oil exploration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Government, in introducing this Bill, is trying in all sincerity to do something that it thinks is right for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main thought behind the Bill is to preserve the petroleum and mineral resources of this country for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to ensure that those resources are mined and developed for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was referred to as a Ned Kelly because he is protecting the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and because he is not prepared to see exploitation by foreign companies and foreign ownership of what belongs to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are using our discretion, in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This red herring is always drawn across the path when efforts are made by a Labor government to protect the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the comment that the whole purpose of this Bill is to look for an attitude towards Australian minerals and our petroleum which will protect the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and will ensure that what we do is in our best interests- not of private enterprise but of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be to the detriment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> if it is not passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is salutory that the attention of the Senate and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ought to be drawn to the wretched little company called Federation Insurance Ltd which has continued the same policy of intimidation as was used to try to break the trade union movement and the Labor movement from its very beginning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When revealed to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> they will make their judgment accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Western <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will have had enough of storm troopers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That whereas our constitutional parliamentary democracy was clearly developed as a Federation to preserve for all time to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> their cherished right to live as free men and women, enjoying complete liberty of worship, assembly, speech, movement and the communication of knowledge and information, and whereas our existing Australian flag and our national anthem, ‘God Save The Queen’ are perpetual reminders of these hard-won freedoms and of the wise British principle of the division of power, so well reflected in our own Australian Constitution with its careful separation of powers as between the Crown and Commonwealth Parliament, the Senate, the State parliaments, the Government-General and State Governors, and the independent courts of justice, and whereas all such rights, liberties, heritage, advancement and prosperity, etc., are of no avail if our armed forces are unprepared or incapable of repelling invasion of our shores or withstanding other military threats, so therefore must all these things be accorded the highest national concern and priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Australian media have been unanimous, as I believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be, in their advice to the Prime Minister to say an immediate and outright no to Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the continued rundown of the Australian defence force, the erosion of our defence capacity and the deliberate understatement of Australia’s vulnerability in a volatile world, are detrimental to the long-term security and wellbeing of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For many years, at election after election, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been brainwashed by the propaganda of fear that was put out by the opponents of Labor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had to be convinced that they were in danger of external threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course we are interested in the defence of this country, and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are interested in the defence of this country, too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That whereas our constitutional parliamentary democracy was clearly developed as a Federation to preserve for all time to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> their cherished right to live as free men and women, enjoying complete liberty of worship, assembly, speech, movement and the communication of knowledge and information, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their decision should be a fair decision which, without any doubt, would be accepted by all the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But by 1972 it had become apparent to the great mass of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that that was a dirty and unwinnable war and that in fact there was a need to clear the slate as far as politicians in Australia were concerned and to elect to government a party which had consistently followed a policy of not being involved in any war in Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last 18 months since this Government was elected in 1 972 it has sought to implement the mandate that was given to it by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but these 10 senators have been sitting in judgment and have been attempting to nullify and to destroy the mandate that was given to the Government by the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has sought in every way to exercise the mandate given to it by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but that mandate has been set aside, amended or rejected by a number of people whom history has passed by in terms of the political development of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have a situation which is most unsatisfactory from the point of view of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, brought about by the intransigence of the Queensland Government and by attempts of members of this House and by other members of the national Parliament to try to prevent the regularising of  Senator Gair’s  retirement from this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What sort of a trick are we trying to play upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these projects will be financed by the recycling of the $50m to $60m hitherto paid to undeserving companies without in most cases an effective return and certainly without any interest accruing to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For several years the belief has grown amongst <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that Australia was being sold out too cheaply to foreign interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition was not only unconcerned that its own Senate Select Committee had concluded after inquiry that the AIDC and the Australian Resources Development Bank were far too insignificant to be considered a major force in the capital market and recommended that the ‘activities of both these two bodies be expanded further’, but also unconcerned too that the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were appalled at the sell-out of Australia and wanted something to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does it want to stand against the Government, against the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> clearly expressed in December 1972, or will it consent to give effect to the will of the people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want something to be done to stop the sell-out of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in the promotion and co-ordination of investment of a free enterprise kind that AIDC will find most of its work and its service to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I say that this whole paper has been deliberately designed to mislead the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into believing that this Government is concerned about Australia’s security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government tries to kid the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it has a friendly and co-operative relationship with the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has sadly repeated what is the greatest fallacy that can ever be inflicted on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in a strategic defence appraisal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The defence statement which has been read to us this afternoon is a fair indication of the panic of this Government now that it has come to the realisation that within a few weeks it will have to face the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and account for its activities over the last 14 or 15 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally, because of this panic, the Government feels that it has to do some window-dressing to try to persuade the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that belatedly it has decided to do something about defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is suggested that this Bill was popular with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- that seems to be the idea in the Minister’s speech- but what happened in Tasmania could hardly be described as showing popularity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Bills are not concerned with the health care of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what about the health of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the sorts of things that made the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> change their minds very rapidly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not shirk from allowing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> an opportunity to pass judgment on the performance of the Government nor of ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government tried to patch it up when it found that there was very stiff resistance from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in relation to the introduction of such a scheme once the people saw a little more of what was involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is something which is vital and fundamental to the understanding by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the debate which has taken place in relation to matters such as this Health Insurance Bill and projected action in relation to certain Appropriation Bills all of which are relevant as being brought together in one debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government in its policy speech did not tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that there was going to be an annual rate of inflation of 14 per cent in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Labor Party promise the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it would introduce this Bill? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did it promise the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it would increase interest rates to the highest level they have ever reached in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have not had the wool pulled over their eyes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scale goes down meticulously from $27 a week to $30 a week and the taxable income is increased by $200 a year to give a pattern of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that does not apply to any <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Forget the trickery of the tables which are supposed to represent the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, because they are not extended into the areas that affect Australian income earners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This evening their remarks have been practically the same word for word, parrot style, as the remarks which were made in this chamber on 1 1 December, I think it was, when legislation of this nature was put forward by the Government after it had received a mandate from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason we put this legislation forward now is that we realise that the Opposition parties have said they will vote against the Supply Bills when they come into the Senate and we want to prove that we have done our very utmost for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to satisfy them that we have tried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They certainly ignore a great deal of the accruing benefits and, perhaps more to their shame, they try to hide the enormous benefits that would flow to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> if this type of legislation were enacted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are only some of the benefits that will be denied to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by the Opposition rejecting the legislation that we have proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the remarks that they have tendered in the Senate today one would gain the impression that if by some mischance at some future election they were re-elected to government they would continue with the hopeless, maladministered ramshackle scheme that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have had to put up with for so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious from the remarks that have been made by the Government’s political opponents that they intend to reject again the progressive legislation that is being introduced by the Labor Governmentlegislation for which undoubtedly and unquestionably it received a mandate from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to introduce and to implement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> certainly will be reminded of these matters between now and 18 May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am certain that on 18 May the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> overwhelmingly will give the Labor movement another mandate to implement its progressive policy of a universal health insurance program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not be fooled by this last minute panic move, because they know that there has been one promise broken after another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the stance of the Government today; but the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have no assurance whatever that there would not be a different stance if the present Government, by some great mischance, were returned to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ought to be grateful for honourable senators who sit on this side of the chamber with me and who have brought the Government to its senses so that it is starting to make the proper decisions, even if it is making them only for cheap electoral purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Government introducing the same Bills on a number of occasions on the one subject matter, seeks to mislead the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as to the actual number of matters opposed and defeated by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, introducing the same Bills on a number of occasions on the one subject matter, seeks to mislead the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as to the actual number of matters opposed and defeated by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although it may be a fuzzy term, I repeat that we have a mandate from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on most of those Bills which are of critical importance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>failed to fulfil the expectations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because of its administrative incompetence; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not fertile soil for ideas that their country shall be dominated by an executive Cabinet and also by a bureaucracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> accepted the program which was put before them by the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an important occasion in the life of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will see whether the Opposition is prepared to carry its arrogance, its obstruction and its denial of the rights of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> any further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think the national Parliament should recognise the work carried out by these people, because in an age of materialism and of some cynicism it shows that the heart of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> beats warmly and rapidly when others are unfortunately affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister not agree that the confused economic and tariff policies of the Government have threatened employment and, therefore, living standards and the general economic well-being and prosperity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was during his 2 years as Australia ‘s first Royal Governor-General, between 1945 and 1947, that he became so well known and well liked by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When an attempt was made to give this country complete control over its resources and to give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> an opportunity to receive the benefits from the exploitation of its resources, similar, although I must admit less severe, attacks were made on the Minister concerned by people outside the Parliament and by people from outside Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not until the Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Snedden,  forced the Labor Party to recognise that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were concerned about inflation and its consequences that the Prime Minister decided to change his tactics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, after a great number of threats had been made in another place and in this House over a period of some 14 months, whilst the Government was laying down its initial plans for the development and construction of a new Australia, based on the outline of the policy speech of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  of November 1972 and supported by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on 2 December 1972, these people, by political manoeuvres in which they were aided and abetted by another political party that was represented in this chamber at that time, went to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and said: ‘We will put the Government to the test’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-With a slightly reduced majority but overall- collectively so far as votes throughout Australia are concerned- with a majority of votes being cast by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in support of the policies and candidates of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as the Senate is concerned we no longer have a situation in which a combination of members of the Liberal Party, the Australian Country Party, the National Alliance or whatever else it calls itself, and the Australian Democratic Labor Party can, by sheer numbers, outweigh the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition wants the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to accept that the Australian Labor Party has no mandate to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trouble is that the Opposition does not own the ball, as it was told by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on 18 May, and it does not own the game. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly it cannot be entertained now as an acceptable hypothesis to explain the latest electoral choice of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They saw the expensive television advertising campaign that was conducted non-stop by our political opponents for 3 weeks, and despite all the finance, the wherewithal, available to our political opponents, despite their great expenditure on the air-waves of this nation, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> turned out on 18 May and returned the Government to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Leader of the Opposition must do if he is to justify the trust that a section of the people have placed in him obviously is to accept the reality- and I say this to all members of the Opposition- that the Opposition lost and no longer has the confidence of the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That amendment was put to this Parliament on 6 March and the matters referred to in it were put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on 18 May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> overwhelmingly rejected them and today, despite the mandate given to the Government by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, in typical fashion- as  Senator Poyser  uses the expression, like cockatoos- the Opposition comes back with an amendment similarly worded to the one moved on 6 March this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to examine further this amendment that has been proffered today, apart from comparing it with the one moved only last March which was completely rejected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in May this year, let us go to the amendment moved in March 1973, 4 months after this Government was elected to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition then sought to add these words to the Address-in-Reply:  but the Senate is of the opinion and regrets that- The Government in its conduct of the nation’s affairs has subordinated the security and welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on whose behalf it should govern to the factional decisions of the Conference and Executive of the Australian Labor Party, in that: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To that he may have added also that the Labor Party has formed a government and that this Labor Government, having received a second mandate from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, is now embarking on a constructive rebuilding of this nation after 23 years of neglect by Liberal-Country Party Administrations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appeal to their sense of realism and their sense of responsibility, not just as senators but as elected representatives of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to reject this amendment forthwith and turn to much more important matters of state, including the normal discussion of the Address-in-Reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this circumstance we are aware of the affirmed determination of the Governor- I am now quoting-‘ to carry out, fully and promptly, the program for change twice endorsed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must retain freedom of choice within the common law if we are to survive as a free democracy in the tradition of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I speak of primary industry and the strife that this ripping away is causing, let me say that primary industry to me involves a vast cross section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had 2 elections in 1 8 months and, if I may express a private view, the second of those elections was perhaps logically necessary to convince some honourable senators in this chamber that the wish of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as expressed in 1972 for change in our community and in our society generally still existed strongly in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last 18 months, from certain sections of our community we have heard evidence of the pain which is being experienced by those who feel themselves threatened by the changes which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> regard as necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were subjected to what was sometimes described as the great health debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It revolved around the Government’s program which had been well researched and well considered and which was opposed by a party which had no alternative health insurance program to offer to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- and even at this stage that party has no viable health insurance program to offer to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important point I make about the health insurance program and the changes which are taking place in the industrial relations field is simply that in both areas the Government’s policies represent an enlargement of the freedoms of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again it is a question of raising the options and the freedoms of masses of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who cannot afford economically to make decisions which benefit their own children and who have to rely on the system which is provided by the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s proposals recognise that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a right to enjoy this country’s historical heritage and its unique environment, and that that right should not be limited by the interests of particular groups in our community who are concerned, for private gain, to take those rights away from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our society has realised that in Australia there are things which we value and which all the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should have the opportunity to share. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They also involve, in their own way, an enlargement of the freedoms of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are new and real freedoms which the Government has started to give to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the last 18 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we talk about freedom, let us look at what the concept of freedom really means in real terms for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and not for certain selected individuals in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have never heard any evidence for that assertion, and I look forward to hearing it in this chamber because whatever we do we must be sure that the democratic institutions and the framework of government in Australia reflect the aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and allow the members of this chamber and of the other chamber to act in a way which fulfils the aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the 1970s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last 12 months 5 referenda were brought before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing we must be vigilant to avoid in Australia is an attack on parliamentary institutions which would render them unable to fulfil their responsibilities to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that it matches up to the promises made to us and to all the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first thing that was agreed to and subsequently ratified by referendum of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> was that there should be equal representation for each of the original 6 States in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are those who know that the so-called doctrine of even-handedness in the Middle East has been one of immense partisanship one way and there are those who know the way in which we will be moving if the left wing socialists in Victoria and those who espouse the views that  Senator Brown  has put forward of late get their way and the values that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have held in the past are to be destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Electoral reform is fundamental to the platform of the Australian Labor Party which was endorsed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on 18 May 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a forward step towards electoral reform in line with the Australian Labor Party policy and views of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conformity with the Government’s policy of open government and in an earnest endeavour to make Government books available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, my Department has established a mobile inquiry centre and a mobile bookshop in New South Wales and hopefully it is contemplated that eventually we will have at least seven of these bookshops operating on the mainland of Australia- two in Queensland, two in New South Wales, one in Victoria, one in South Australia and one in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in conformity with the Government’s practice of ensuring that these publications relating to all facets of governmental activity are made available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at a reasonable price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been unquestionably endorsed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and I commend the Bill to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While this may suit the Chinese people, I am sure that it will never suit the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government recognises that although the 1974 election resulted in the return of the Government it has not resolved the real differences that are being felt by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that therein lies the hope of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that they will see in the majority which will exist in this chamber from time to time a responsibility to which this Government will be responsive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One  speaker  said that this Government was a government which was preaching and making change, that it was in office because it was prepared to make those changes that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for involving people in the decision making processes, why, even the Labor Caucus does not know the decisions which are being made, let alone the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they continue to take the view that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> did not really vote for Labor at the last Federal election, they will continue to be disillusioned in future and they will never develop the ideological core and reason for existence which they need and which we on this side of the Senate need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now is the time to put it to the choice of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is to happen, it can happen only by the freely expressed will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s exceeded its mandate and I believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a right to re-assess their point of view and to affirm or reject the Government that it put into office 18 months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In energy reserves, the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  has clearly stated, both in Japan and Australia, the Australian Government’s policy to ensure that these are, to the maximum, under Australian ownership and control, in the long-term interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the holder of an exploration permit is incapable of fully exploring the area held, then the surplus should be returned to the Australian Government in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, so that it can, itself, participate on at least a 50/50 basis with the new farminee whose obligation is to provide the necessary risk capital and technology to match the proprietary rights of the Australian nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Opposition in this Parliament is frustrating the Government’s endeavours to restore the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to their rightful place in their own country, as the owners and keepers of the national estate and the nation’s resources, and as fair and equal sharers in the national wealth, the foreign interests who dominate our energy business are continuing to acquire, through the State governments, control over some of the best and most accessible coal resources of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is almost as if there is some sort of conspiracy to ignore the past, to ignore the rightful place of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the national estate, and to deny the opportunities to our own citizens which these developments present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Starting from where we must now start it is a great challenge, but the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are paramount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Government’s view, the creation of this Authority will be to the great and permanent advantage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be serving a national purpose in gaining for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a proper place in their own country and in the resources of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the third paragraph of that Speech which states:   my advisers have taken the view that the first responsibility of the Government is to carry out, fully and promptly, the program for change twice endorsed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put the following questions to the Senate: Do the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> endorse the program of change that has resulted in the highest interest rates on record? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have given their answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They ought to have a good look at their consciences and a good look at the bank accounts of their friends who have continually set out to profiteer at the expense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government will not allow the overwhelming decision of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the referendum of 1961 to be any longer denied or disregarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there was a judgment by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who realised that what was being promised was not what the Bills contained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it could not get one vote one value earlier in its lifetime as a Government, it put forward a totally different proposal which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, after all, was one of the 6 Bills on which the Governor-General gave the double dissolution to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I do not think anyone can really argue that this was not in the consciousness of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and that they did not vote quite clearly on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a very clear situation which has been put before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main issue involved in handing over those areas of control of Aboriginals is to permit the Australian Government to put into operation the mandate that was given to it in the 1967 referendum on the belief of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Australian Government could better handle the question of Aboriginal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the will of the Premier to whom I refer will not become the expression of the Parliament of his State and that we will see the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as expressed in the 1967 referendum, operating under Australian Government control for the betterment of Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the next phrase is what needs to be emphasised to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and put forward for, I hope, the good judgment of honourable senators:  -to the extent and on the terms which it thinks fit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would hope that the Opposition would take a more mature position, would heed some of the advice which has been given it from friendly sources and would get with the mood of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, which is for change, modification and improvement to our whole way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would hope that the Opposition would give the Government some sort of opportunity to implement the policies which it quite openly presented to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we are asking,  Mr President,  is that following a double dissolution- this was one of the Bills which was involved in the double dissolution, it was one of the Bills which was clearly in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and it was one of the Bills on which the Governor-General decided to give us a double dissolution- the Australian Capital <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case it is the money of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the people’s money, and what is different about the application of this system is that it is intended to remove the choice which has formerly been given to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we allow the tyranny of numbers in a House of government to force upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a new system of diminished health care, we are handing to the Government of the day a system of administration of health care and not one of delivery of health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who would pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear, for example, that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have expressed a preference for the private hospital care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not had time to read in depth the recommendations in that report but it would seem to me that it was necessary for the Government to have that information before it drew up the guidelines for the scheme which it has presented to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and which will leave such gaps in the accommodation which is available at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the proposals of the Government and these are things which I question as being the type of health care program for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason there has been a projected cost of knowledge of medical programs and care which has been delivered to <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government would be subsidising increasingly the health program it had designed for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they think, in the same manner as people on that side of the chamber think, that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are behind them they are completely wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want the Labor Government’s health care scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Vietnam war was not a health scheme of concern to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; it was a death scheme of a completely different variety which was not costed and the costs of which have never been given to this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, we are here to discuss a health insurance scheme for the whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Liberal-Country Party Opposition has interpreted what the people of Australia said in December 1972 and again in May 1974 only by looking, as it were, into every living room in Australia and saying: Look, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> might have voted for the Labor Party on 2 occasions but no, they did not vote for a national health insurance scheme, or they did not vote for Senate representation for the Territories, or they did not vote for electoral reform or for anything else that we happened to dislike. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Cavanagh  has suggested, one thing is perfectly clear: The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> knew what was going to happen about the health insurance scheme if they voted for the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the Government has a mandate and the authority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to introduce such legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a hoax to suggest to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that they are in for a new deal in health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None of us got here except by the votes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Someone has to pay, and it will be the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally I repeat that the basis of the scheme is that there will be universal coverage for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for the cost of medical care and hospitalisation in a standard ward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These doctors to whom I have referred are the sort of people that this Opposition supports at the cost of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who want a scheme that will take some of the terror out of being ill or having loved ones ill by at least giving to the people comfort in the knowledge that the money part of it is under control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, it is because the Opposition stands for the protection of vested interests and subsidies to the rich against the greater good and welfare of the great mass of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet this proposed health scheme that we now will see forced upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> has been dreamed up by economists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are here to carry out the policies of the Australian Labor Party and we are here to carry out the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who put the Australian Labor Party into government in order to carry out the policies for which they voted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am surprised that  Senator Baume, Senator Townley  or one of the other Opposition senators did not tell us about the wonders of medical services in the Philippines, Thailand, Uganda, the Central African Republic and those countries which have the sort of medical service which Opposition senators would like the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have- that is to say, no health insurance and medical services completely in the hands of private enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Guilfoyle  has told us how tragic it is that the rights of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be taken away from them in order that they should engage in compulsory health insurance, ls she arguing that compulsory insurance in toto is to be condemned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conceding that, we believe that the only way and the fairest way in which such provision can be made for the health of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is a system of compulsory national health insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are here to make substantial changes in the society, to the benefit of the people whom we represent and to the benefit of all of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly we are all aware that the conduct of private hospital benefit funds has been that of private entrepreneurs engaging in a businessand the business they have been dealing with is the health of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been to a very large extent a means of providing very great rewards for these people who have occupied executive positions in a series of organisations which have not in any way served the best interests of a national health scheme for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for that reason that we went to a double dissolution- and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> re-elected us to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have raped the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not want to see the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a right to exploit some of Australia’s mineral wealth for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet honourable senators opposite can rise in the Senate and defend such exploitation and say that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have no right to share in the mineral wealth of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those comments disclose a complete lack of confidence in the initiative, the know-how, the business acumen, the skills and the ability of the Australian peoplethe business people and the work force- to engage in industry whether it be the manufacturing of aircraft, in the field of science or medicine or in the extractive industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that I never cease to be amazed at the lack of confidence that the Opposition discloses in our own <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important, first of all, to establish that in fact the Australian Labor Party obtained the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to honourable senators that the Australian Labor Party obtained the expressed support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to do the very thing that we have attempted to do on this occasion for the third time-that is, to establish a minerals and energy commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the great importance to this nation of the Bill which has been endorsed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, I trust that the Senate will reject the amendment and pass the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I have is a brief for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the powers under our Constitution and existing law to preserve, conserve and develop the precious minerals we have in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it came to office the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had been benefiting from an enormous success in terms of the finding of petroleum products and their refining and sale in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will perceive 2 constant themes in our mineral and mining policies-the preservation of Australian ownership and the maximising of benefits to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from the sale of our natural resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>.the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> deserve to receive a good and proper share of the income from these resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that all the minerals in Australia belong to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> until by arrangement they are discovered in partnership in one form or another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to effect that protection we have to take some action, and the action proposed by the Government is to establish the Authority which in fact will be vested with powers in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is putting this legislation forward in the best faith and in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the policy which we promoted during out term of government is the correct one, that is, to encourage Australian equity but not to force the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to provide finance or to insist upon a particular amount being provided for mineral development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The way to do that is to apply a taxation incentive which will encourage <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to invest in Australian companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be the fights in the areas outside this chamber, but when the vote has to be taken honourable senators opposite will troop into the chamber and, even on the night when the proceedings of the Senate are being broadcast, without giving the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> some idea as to why they are supporting or proposing this Bill they will simply vote in favour of it and remain silent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply say that it will not work if the real objective of the effort is to find out what minerals we have and to exploit those minerals in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can share eq ally the benefits of the mineral resources that lie off our shores. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that this Government is endeavouring to bring forward a code and legislation which will enable it to distribute to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on an equitable basis the benefits that accrue from our off-shore resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To suggest that there is a greater urgency to discuss this question than there is to find a very greatly needed solution to the cynicism and anxiety that confronts the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> today is complete and utter rubbish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now is the time for the Parliament to give a lead and try to halt the rate of inflation which could cripple every aspiration of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this matter is as serious as honourable senators opposite are making it out to be- if they say that what they are doing tonight will be a challenge to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, a challenge to the Australian trade union movement and a challenge to the Australian white collar workers- the problem will not be solved by pegging the wages of 187 people and agreeing to increases for thousands of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It said that while parliamentarians are fixing their own salaries, with the suspicion that they are in collusion with judges and with the public servants with whom we have to work so closely, it does not give a genuine feeling to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I found that, with dependants, I could get through the period which I fear lies ahead ofthe <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, we have to break this psychological nexus which is driving the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to try to chase money in order to keep ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and of the image of Parliament itself that the Senate concur in the resolution transmitted to it from the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This statement, which contained sub-headings such as ‘The Inflationary Outlook’, ‘Inflation and Our Society’, ‘The Control of Demand’, and Restraint of Expenditure’ carried the clear message that the Government was introducing into this Parliament, and unveiling for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, a really tough and courageous program to deal with inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I believe that this Senate has every right, and has the duty in fact, to defer this legislation, knowing full well, as I think previous honourable senators speaking in this debate have sensibly indicated, that it is not to be held out to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that there is some great saving of the additional costs of PMG services for a long time into the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is before the Senate because the Government has the courage to measure up to its responsibilities to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are compelled to take this course of action because if we do not we will not be acting in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am wondering whether this measure, introduced in the Senate by the PostmasterGeneral, is just something to condition the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to accepting substantial and severe additional taxes when the Budget is presented to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That denied us a base upon which to build an adequate system of child care for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One means by which it is proposed that these developments are introduced to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as soon as possible will be through the development of an Australian urban passenger train. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the efficiency that has been developed through experience, we wonder whether the new scheme will result in greater benefits to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who will have to pay for this scheme, will be faced with escalating costs which we cannot control by the simple expedient of using our feet and marching to a different fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That money, or a large part of it, will be raised from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the scheme is in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On very many occasions the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber  (Senator Withers)  and the Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  and the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  in the other place clearly said to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>: ‘We want to test this Government at the electorate level, and we want the people of Australia to vote and pass judgment’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have done that, and we are to face the challenge that I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter has been put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> 3 times in general terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Bills are part of Labor’s welfare program for all the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We intend to carry on our fight to see that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have the best health system in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have lived through an age in which health officials and governments have fought strenuously to relieve the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the conditions which prevail in intensely concentrated terrace houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder why the Government has not considered that it has a duty to voluntary organisations within the community, which serve the community and which, with the Government, seek to cover the health needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is beneficial to the contributors and it is part of that merit of our health scheme which I believe is in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to continue because the Australian contributor can pay his contributions for private ward treatment in a public hospital, his contributions for intermediate ward treatment in a public hospital and his contributions for public ward treatment in a public hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome the opportunity thus provided for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to see the workings of their Parliament at close hand, to consider the Bills now before us and to reflect on the reasons why this extraordinary Joint Sitting of Parliament has come about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has come about because despite two successive election victories by the Australian Labor Party, despite the clear endorsement by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the elections only 1 1 weeks ago of the Party’s policies and of the specific measures now before us, the Senate and the Opposition are still resolved to obstruct the Government’s program and to frustrate the will of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, in May this year, the Government submitted a referendum to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> seeking to have the principle of electoral equality entrenched in the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> saw through the proposal and rejected it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I venture to suggest that if this legislation had been put forward as a referendum proposal it too would have been rejected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not do so because he knew that if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had been able to examine that one single issue they would have rejected it out of hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it ought to be made quite clear that the Labor Party Government is seeking to have this legislation approved with one motive in mind, and that should not need any explanation to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Government has so skilfully and falsely presented the facts to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that many think that there is a difference of 40 per cent between country electorates and city electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now is the time to put it to the choice of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is to happen, it can happen only by the freely expressed will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s exceeded its mandate and I believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a right to reassess their point of view and to affirm or reject the Government that it put into office 1 8 months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s a case now of whether the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> still feel the same as they did in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were a wake up to it so they threw its proposals out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A political party like the Country Party which rarely receives more than about 10 per cent of the votes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> has a disproportionate influence on the welfare of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian people</span> truly representative government and to give practical expression to the immortal words of Abraham Lincoln, which still echo down through the ages and linger in the minds of all democrats, namely: ‘Government of the people, by the people, for the people ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any Prime Minister who is prepared to come into this chamber, on an occasion such as this, and, mouth the fundamentals of democracy but who clearly is unable to provide leadership for the Australian democracy at the present time is not capable of maintaining the confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is of great importance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very glad that television has been brought to this Parliament on this occasion because it brings the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> right into this Parliament and allows them to see the merits and demerits of the Government case and the Opposition case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He either does not see or will not admit that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> choose to elect the senators whom they prefer and not those whom the Prime Minister wants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been subjected to extensive debate in the House of Representatives and in the Senate on 2 separate occasions in each place, and it has been before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is absolutely no doubt that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want a system which gives equality of value of votes for all voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ours is the only Party which truly reflects the thinking of the vast majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, if the Minister is successful in having this legislation approved by the Joint Sitting he will immediately look at the 1972 election results; he will look at the electorate of Bowman and at all of those other electorates which Labor is just holding by a whisker, and he will suddenly start bolstering those electorates which need attention so that when the onslaught comes from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the next election those people who represent these electorates will have a greater chance of continuing in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We oppose this Bill because it is another of those measures by which the Government, without expressing its ultimate intentions, is seeking to pull the wool over the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A little while ago in the House of Representatives we heard the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp)  say in respect of one of the measures that the Joint Sitting will discuss tonight or tomorrow- I refer to the National Health legislation which proposes a health scheme on which this Government campaigned and was elected; it was proposed first to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in 1968 and was restated in 1969, 1972 and 1974-that he and the Opposition would go to the barricades rather than yield one iota, one inch, to the will of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will have the voice but not the power, and not quite the term of ordinary senators; indeed not quite the term in a form which was rebutted by the Australian electorate in one of the referenda proposals which were submitted to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on 1 8 May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Constitution was drawn up, when it was agreed to by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, it was agreed to only after very sustained argument and discussion, and it was no lightly arrived at decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on the Government side believe that if we have to have a Senate we should try to make it a House which is a little more representative of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason, while feeling nothing but disenchantment with the Senate, as I think a growing number of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are feeling, I support the Government’s proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps those views are shared by other people, but not by the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that perhaps at this late hour, as the honourable member for the Northern Territory, he would have thrown some light on some of the curious performances that we have seen coming from his colleagues with regard the entitlements of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have had revealed to them a series of spokesmen from the Opposition parties whose main goal during the whole of this Joint Sitting has been to deprive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the right democratically to elect the Parliament of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that it is intolerable that any Australian, wherever he may live, whatever his ethnic origin or whatever his educational standard may be, should be deprived of the right to vote in the election of the Parliament of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition hates the very thought of equal representation of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the same way that it hates the thought of any representation of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that democratic government is the only form of government which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How wise subsequent events have proved the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were in rejecting this rash of referenda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of principle, because we believe that this health scheme proposed by the Labor Party would be a disaster to the health of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Opposition cares about is the health of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This debate concerns not only those people who are now living, but also those to be born, because once this Labor health scheme is impacted on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> there is no getting away from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that it was quite fair and proper for me to refer to the Government’s miserable record over the past 18 months to allow the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to assess what hope this health scheme has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition will not abandon its duty to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have not sunk home to the people who matter, the people who pay the medical bills- the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- because they have been caught up in this political propaganda war that has been waged by our political opponents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But,  Mr Acting Chairman,  the Opposition has deliberately set out to hoodwink the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As part of its propaganda war it conveniently forgets to mention some of the benefits accruing to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from this scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberals have not told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, for instance, that the present hospital bed benefit of 80c a day for uninsured hospital patients is the same as the amount which was introduced by the Chifley Labor Government in 1948- never changed by conservative governments over nearly a quarter of a century- and they have not told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Labor Government wants to increase that subsidy to hospitals for uninsured patients from 80c a day to $ 16 a day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though it is repetitious, I repeat that the program was fully endorsed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on 1 8 May 1 974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was not possible in the 23 years that the Opposition had the chance to provide a health service to cover <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that left logic behind, but I agreed with him when he said that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> endorsed these Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What about the spirit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is the Government now pleading with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to get up and go and help the Government out of the economic chaos into which we have plunged? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was one of the few constitutional amendments carried by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both sides of the Parliament had to put forward to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the sort of amendment to our Constitution which enabled the provision of maternity allowances, widows’ pensions, child endowment, unemployment benefits and pharmaceutical, sickness and medical benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He had that clause inserted in a proposed amendment to the Constitution and enabled the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to accept it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is a civil conscription that is not tolerable in industrial matters tolerable to the medical profession or to any other body of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That amendment to the Constitution was passed and on that basis we constructed the present medical scheme assisted by government with a voluntary use of medical funds by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Progressively the system has been built to serve the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and their health needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The dangers of the proposed health scheme on the medical profession, on the private hospital system and on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> make me feel very concerned about the fact that the Government should persist in introducing a scheme which is not wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who considers that there is competition between schemes which charge the same rates, which give the same benefits, which have the same forms and which have the same regulations has a peculiar concept of competition, as has someone who refers to referendum results as an indication that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not want this proposed health scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the record of this Minister, this Prime Minister and this Government over the last 20 months the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be extremely unwise to listen to or to heed reassuring noises of any description. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will live to regret this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is trying to confuse the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as so many have tried to confuse the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, including the Australian Medical Association and many of the voluntary insurance funds, by identifying the Goverment ‘s scheme with a public ward scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The private health insurance funds have failed to give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the protection they require. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The commonsense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> was manifest when the Constitution was first adopted, because in the matter of health only one power was conferred on the Commonwealth Government- the power of quarantine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Economic conscription, with all its compulsion and with all its direction, has always been anathema to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, but the Government intends to impose it on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in respect of health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The further question should be asked: In what respect does the Government intend to impose this economic conscription upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his 1972 policy speech the Prime Minister said that the Australian Labor Party was determined that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be restored to their rightful place in their own country, as the owners and keepers of the national estate, and the nation’s resources, and as fair and reasonable sharers in the national wealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government believes that Australian ownership and control of the nation’s assets is no longer a matter of debate, but an objective to be shared by the great mass of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of all political persuasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have refused such ‘farm-outs’, stating that areas which cannot be explored by existing permit holders should be returned to the Australian Government to be let out by it on a participating basis, ensuring at least a 50 per cent direct return to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Anthony) has just said, that the Minister has become a living legend in the history of the Australian mining industry because he represents the turning point in the history of this nation against the sell-out of Australian resources, with which I will deal in a few minutes, to the statement of a full and effective responsibility of the Australian Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in relation to that mining industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the great majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> agree with us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is concerned that the industry should contribute more to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> than it does and it is convinced that something like the Petroleum and Minerals Authority for which this Bill provides is necessary for that purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Very shortly we will see Doug Anthony House next to John McEwen House if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are foolish enough to let the Liberal and Country Parties have another crack at the title. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that the Government was determined that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be restored to their rightful place in their own country as owners and keepers of the national estate and that control of the country’s national resources should be vested in the people as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important to adopt that approach because of the attempt by the Government, particularly by the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor),  who is sitting at the table, to conclude 3 things: Firstly, that the Government has some sort of a mandate for this proposed legislation, secondly, that the proposed Authority would be in real interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; and thirdly, that any opposition to the Bill is unfair or perhaps improper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposals contained in this Bill are against the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They see the need for <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have a share in that exploitation and they see the need for the development of a national policy for minerals and energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just as the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> almost wholly financed our oil refining capacity in the 1 950s via the manipulation of import prices for oil, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have almost wholly financed much of the mineral development of Australia in the 1 960s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The essential issue is what return are the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> going to obtain from the exploitation of the country’s own natural resources? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the chance for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to own some of their own property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We heard this great hymn, this great tirade, this great deceit- a grand deceit among many grand deceits- of telling the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that this country was being sold down the drain, that it was being sold out to multi-national companies, and all the other things-the type of thing that  Senator Keeffe  raised tonight- that Government supporters throw into the ring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first characteristic is the belief of the Australian Labor Government in the will of the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> prevailing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party’s aims, backed by the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, are clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want it working for the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the greatest extent possible we want it owned and controlled by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that 250 pieces of legislation, in round figures, were introduced into the Parliament last year and that the great bulk of them were passed into law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These 6 Bills found their way to this Joint Sitting and they are opposed even in this last hour by the Liberal and Country Parties, not out of wanton obstructionism but because this side of the chamber, representative of opinion held over a wide spectrum of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, believes that they are bad in principle and are likely to detract from the effectiveness of our parliamentary democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second basic proposition- if anything the more basic point- is the legitimate national sentiment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that Australians should be in the vanguard of the development of this country and that there should be a maximum of Australian ownership and control of our industries and resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no way- just no way- in which the Government can pretend to be more concerned about Australia, about the development of Australia, and about the true welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> than this side of the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding all the anti-climax, it may be historic in its irrelevance to the frightening situation that prevails in Australia and to the bankruptcy of the leadership and the example that this Canberra government is giving to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that what we are doing is merely giving this lad a chance to state openly what he wants and we are showing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that this is what we are doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think also we ought to look at it and say to ourselves: ‘The Senate as an institution did a job on those 2 Bills that ought to merit the acceptance of those views by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, by the Government, and by the advisers, as having been worth while’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the sell-out of these sectors of the Australian economy which led the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to express tremendous concern about the whole question of foreign investment in Australia in 1 972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the situation in 1972 when the issue of foreign investment in Australia was a key one in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and was undoubtedly very alarming to most Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That change has been induced partly by the process of dialogue which has occurred with industry and with the Opposition and partly, of course, by the consistent pressure of the views of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in favour of this legislation, which views have now been expressed very firmly in 2 elections and in Press comment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the real importance and significance of the National Investment Fund to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is that it will enable not only foreign investors and Australian financial institutions but also Australian citizens- be they wealthy or relatively poor- who wish to invest in the expansion of the Australian economy to have a slice of the cake, as it were, and to invest through the National Investment Fund in great national enterprises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it were not to do so, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> could well regard themselves as having been sold out by a majority of the Senate on the altar of vested business and commercial interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat what I said this morning: There has been only one thing in my mind right from the very start, that is, not only to obtain what this man’s free wish is, but also to show the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as best we can what his wishes are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That whereas our constitutional parliamentary democracy was clearly developed as a Federation to preserve for all time to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> their cherished right to live as free men and women, enjoying complete liberty of worship, assembly, speech, movement and the communication of knowledge and information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-6">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I may say that I asked  Mr Tonkin  whether he would go to see  Mr Ermolenko  because I wanted a man who I believe, irrespective of politics, is completely accepted politically by the Western <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, to see  Mr Ermolenko. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator has asked what we have done to get this sort of information, which is information of a very high quality, to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That whereas our constitutional parliamentary democracy was clearly developed as a Federation to preserve for all time to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> their cherished right to live as free men and women, enjoying complete liberty of worship, assembly, speech, movement and the communication of knowledge and information, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe, by contrast, that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> wholeheartedly support the new independence which this Government has shown, and has pursued with success and with distinction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the Australian Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have known of this decision? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite obvious that honourable senators opposite want to go through it all again because they are afraid to confront the real issues which are facing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He has carried out the policies of the Australian Government which have been supported by the overwhelming majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was bitterly clear to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and this must be faced, that at the election of 18 May the Government had given its word that there would be no de jure recognition of the incorporation of those states in Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe, and I am quite sure that the bulk of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believe, that the action he took was to the best advantage of the young Russian who was the victim of political stunters in Perth who are opposed to the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that we would not be fulfilling the obligation which we as Opposition senators owe to an electorate which put us into this chamber on the policies which we expressed to the electorate if we were not to express views totally consistent with the views which we held in Government and which we put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an instrument which the Australian Government can use for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has never attempted to exercise overt power or an unreasonable power in developing those resources and maintaining control over them in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not be diverted from our objective of ensuring that the resources of this country remain in the hands of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and are used for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I emphasise that but for these recent actions, the basic postage paid by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be 9c instead of the 10c now necessary; the telephone rental on business and government services would be $75 instead of the $85 they must now pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a difference between international aid and concessional loans, but the operation of both of them is the business of both the Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the form of election which is satisfactory for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to elect their government- at this stage an Australian Labor Party Government- should be an excellent and indeed necessary form by which to elect whether a union is to amalgamate with another union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although it deals with the question of inflation in Britain, I think that one can see in it more and more a growing resemblance between the situations and problems which face the British people and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It mounted a very expensive campaign and influenced the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to vote against the referendum which was designed to give us the power to control prices and wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that these truths be emphasised and brought forward to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because in the last 20 months we have had many instances of the Australian Labor Party going to the people and claiming many grand and fine things, but underneath it all the truth lurks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the people of Australia are becoming suspicious of rhetoric and clever debating, and that in the next election there will be a more realistic assessment of what is being offered to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Through Film Australia, the Australian Government’s film production arm, to make or commission the making of films serving the purposes of a Department of State or authority of Australia; films dealing with matters of national interest to Australia, and films designed to illustrate or interpret aspects of Australia or of the life and activities of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In round figures, increases of about $3,000m by way of increased income tax and company tax alone are to be imposed on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I fail to understand why they have had such a change of mind now that they are in government, unless it be simply that they wish to cover up in some way and prevent the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from having an opportunity, through their representatives in the Senate, to ask questions of both Ministers in the Senate, to ask questions of both Ministers and members of the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In any case, one thing is quite certain and that is that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not know what it will do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Caucus and torn about, then to accept something less and go to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and say: ‘We are confidently governing you’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> certainly do not know where they are going in this scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does not he consider that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to a fairer and better explanation than has been given as to why this tremendous sum of money has been paid in the light of those other figures? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, at the moment I would like to deal with the Budget itself, to lay the dust on the wilful distortions by the Opposition Parties, particularly by  Mr Snedden  and his colleagues, and to try to present the Budget to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in an objective way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a responsible Budget because it has allocated record sums for urban redevelopment to improve materially the life styles of the great majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, he does not tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that in the last year of his office, and I am sure that he will concede that we could not be blamed for the unemployment figures as at December 1972, the figure was 2.39 per cent of the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am glad to say that this proved to Tasmanians and the other <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> how quick our parliamentary leader  Mr Snedden  is to see what wrong is being done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there is one problem greater than another facing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> while the present Government is in power it is the varying policy statements either in the Budget or by Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want a return to all the problems of yesteryear and promises which, as I have mentioned, were never given effect to, then they will put back the old conservative crowd again and do away with the progress that Australia is making at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the worst features of this Budget which has been put up to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is the total lack of any national plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So therefore your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate will take action to prevent material and other assistance being sent to the above mentioned organisations in southern Africa which are guilty of various acts of terrorism as such assistance would give the impression of agreement of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Government to the various acts of brutality which have been perpetrated by the organisations concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister: Is it a further measure of the contempt of the Government for this Parliament and for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Prime Minister has disclosed to a Press conference in the United States of America important and controversial details of his Government’s recent talks with the Shah of Iran rather than first reporting those details to this Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Prime Minister callously and cynically betrayed the Baltic people in repudiation of an undertaking that he gave on the eve of the general election on 17 May, so he has equally callously and cynically betrayed the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by his repudiation of promises and undertakings that he gave during the election campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is time the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were given clear policies for the future and an assurance from the Government that it will exercise the self-restraint required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The suggestion that the system be overthrown may not necessarily be the consensus of Government opinion, but at least it is significant and sinister enough to concern the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We consider that as no well-publicised inquiry to which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were invited to submit their views was held, the proposed legislation does not reflect the views of the Australian community in a matter of vital importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before entering into discussion of the provisions contained in the legislation might I say that the great thanks of the industry, indeed of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, should be given to the Minister for the Media  (Senator Douglas McClelland)  for the way in which he has promoted his Department and has done everything possible to advance the interests of the people within the industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia or of the life and activities of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; to assist a State or State authority to purchase Australian films of an educational nature and of national interest of importance; and to encourage the proper keeping of films in archives in Australia, providing financial assitance for this purpose if necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He may give directions with respect to films that are designed to illustrate or interpret aspects of Australia or of the life and activities of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By our amendment we are seeking to remove from the definition of an Australian short film those films which are made or commissioned by the Commission for the purposes of a department of State or an authority of Australia, films that deal with matters of national interest to Australia, and films that are designed to illustrate or interpret aspects of Australia or of the life and activities of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But unfortunately, by a mere transposition of clauses, the Opposition in its old attitude to clause 10 and its new attitude to clause 3 is merely emphasising that it does not want short films produced by Film Australia, or films that serve the purposes of a department of State or an authority of Australia, or films which deal with matters of national interest to Australia, or films that are designed to illustrate or interpret aspects of Australia or of the life and activities of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that are encouraged to be made or made by the Commission, included in the definition ofAustralian short film ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the proposals of the Opposition were accepted they would deprive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of seeing such films in Australian cinemas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>films that are designed to illustrate or interpret aspects of Australia or of the life and activities of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the remarks of the Minister I want to say that his statement about depriving the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of seeing documentary films under commission for a department of State is inaccurate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I think it is being unreasonable in proposing to exclude subparagraph (iii) because that sub-paragraph is a very wide definition in the sense that it refers to films that are designed to illustrate or interpret aspects of Australia or of the life and activities of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one examines the functions of the Commission as contained in paragraph (b) of clause 5 one sees that the Commission may make films subject to the approval of the Minister that serve the purposes of a department of state or an authority of Australia; that deal with matters of national interest to Australia; and films that are designed to illustrate or interpret aspects of Australia or of the life and activities of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I say, the Opposition would not wish it to be suggested that it would not wish to see a wide dissemination of films which, in the words of clause 5 ( 1 ) (b) (i), (ii) and (iii) respectively, are films that serve the purpose of a department of state, films that deal with matters of national interest to Australia or films that are designed to illustrate or interpret aspects of Australia or of the life and activities of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the real problem is getting together on the form of words which should constitute the head of power upon which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> could be asked to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the answer in general terms is that we want a parliament house which expresses the aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but which is at the same time dignified and in harmony with its environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I talk about a house of parliament which expresses the aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> I urge honourable senators not to go back to the medieval view of architecture- to the idea of a building which dominates a city rather than harmonises with it- but to go to a building which is in harmony with both the city in which it exists and with what I respectfully suggest are the true aspirations of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will not create a building which in its own sense and its own features will be a matter cf pride for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that the majority of honourable senators will still think that Capital Hill is the right place for the siting of Parliament House in this city of Canberra so that it might breathe the right atmosphere in an elevated position and with an eminence in the true spirit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever economic difficulties Australia has to go through because of the world-wide events, there is no doubt whatever that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be better off under a Labor Government than they would be under the conservatives who care nothing for the ordinary people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While the divorce rate has risen in Australia rather slowly and not in accord with many other developed western countries whose divorce rates are much higher, nonetheless there is every indication that families and marriage are institutions which are not upheld in the strongest regard by the great majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bulk of the material which was put before the Committee, in terms of evidence and submissions of one kind and another, led me to the conclusion that the Bill, as recommended for amendment, is deserving of the overwhelming support of this Parliament and of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is also supported by the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and that belief is reinforced by the figures which  Senator Missen  had incorporated in Hansard this morning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would suggest to honourable senators that whatever the final figure actually is, be it the upper estimate of $35m or not, for the sake of the welfare of 50,000 <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> it is money spent very much for a purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The attitude of Australian governments and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as regards Aborigines is vastly different to the attitudes in South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that it will not only provide for the receiving nations greater opportunities but also provide an awareness for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the opportunities we have and the responsibilities we hold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that both honourable senators highlighted the attitude of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> towards aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the great things, I think, about our aid program- going back before we were in governmentis that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have never begrudged the amounts of money that we have given for aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the basis that there is a very recent precedent for this motion, I move it in the hope that it will achieve the object of preserving for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a piece of legislation which I do not think has been described extravagantly as one of the most important to come before this Parliament since Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time after time I, as Minister for the Media, have received requests from a large number of people and from diverse sections of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to be provided with scripts of broadcasts or television interviews that have taken place, particularly in ABC programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: Will the Prime Minister announce tonight a comprehensive economic policy or is he to add yet one more unrelated measure to the Government’s ad hoc economic program which to date has proved disastrous for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These things are concocted in an effort to confuse the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only has there been the rising problem of unemployment and the rising problem of inflation for the business community but also there have been the delusions under which the Government has suffered and the illusions which it has endeavoured to foist on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the course of the suffering which they have had to endure particularly in recent months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are seeing at the present time is Australia departing from the traditional alliances and allegiances which have always characterised it and which I believe represent the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But whatever be the attitude taken by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and by the Australian Government with regard to South Africa’s policy, the double standards of this Government require some exposition by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That whereas our constitutional parliamentary democracy was clearly developed as a Federation to preserve for all time to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> their cherished right to live as free men and women, enjoying complete liberty of worship, assembly, speech movement and the communication of knowledge and information, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-1-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a program designed to bring the mass of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into the distribution of welfare provided amongst themselves out of their taxation and out of their efforts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of grave concern and of some distress to me that this great family of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> which is spread right across the country is placed in the hands of a Minister who could not care less about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought either to try to persuade the South Australian Government to alter its attitude with respect to the plan for this area or to acquire it for the benefit of the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as part of the National Estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I point to that difference in the concept of what it is important to preserve in this country and to the work of this Committee as representing a distinct and ongoing aspect of the national aspirations of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> which are sometimes ignored by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of the Aboriginal people here, why should they have any priority over white <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in relation to being on that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If white <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If white <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were to arrive here and dump their caravans on that site- and I said exactly the same thing to my own Government- you and everybody else would be squealing about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is about time that we in this Parliament stopped having racism in this country and stopped giving preference to a certain section of the community over the other <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That whereas our constitutional parliamentary democracy was clearly developed as a Federation to preserve for all time to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> their cherished right to live as free men and women, enjoying complete liberty of worship, assembly, speech, movement and the communication of knowledge and information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, in  1967  the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> directed that Aboriginal affairs was to become a matter for the Australian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On both sides of politics in South Australia there has not been a disagreement nor an assessment that the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> or the South Australian Government, of either colour, has shirked its responsibility by co-operating with the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the whole question is of supreme significance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a Minister and his party go overseas they go overseas not only to represent the Government of the day but also to represent the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that he will do everything he can to see that Australia is independent, as far as it can be, in its access to oil and that as far as possible oil will be obtained on terms which will be the best for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, including Australian industry and commence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will do whatever is in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, from wherever the suggestion or proposal might have come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But before taking those steps we will consider the situation deeply and do whatever is in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will come round quickly to realise that they would be a lot better off if the Australian Labor Government were allowed to implement its policies and do the same as the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unfortunately true that the benefit of those cuts was not passed on to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the reasons we are agreeing to this legislation is that the airline industry is entitled to carry on its equipment program and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to travel on the airline system without having to be unduly held up by lack of equipment, but we say to the Government that we regard this as a pretty untidy and slovenly operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the Qantas capital program, the amount of money provided by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the recoupment to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from the Qantas company in dividends and taxation, we see that it has been a remarkably good investment for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However one would imagine that the Senate, the parliaments generally and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are faced with a somewhat different and a somewhat rushed situation- a position in which little thought has been given to the very human problems which face so many in our community -and that in point of fact the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  and those associated with them have been endeavouring to foist upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, without adequate discussion and consideration, a new concept in marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I am amazed that in the numerous letters which we are receiving, particularly from the Anglican church, there is the suggestion that  Senator Murphy  is in all haste and impatience endeavouring to foist this legislation on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one were to believe what has been said by some honourable senators today or if one were to believe the petitions and the letter writing campaign, one would believe that the overwhelming majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> was opposed to the tenets of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures  Senator Missen  gave on that occasion confirm the figures I received from the Library- that something like three out of four <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> support the general principles embodied in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot see the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> accepting a proposition like that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That judge is the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had the opportunity to judge the value and capacity of the 2 contending political parties in Australia and decided that the Australian Labor Party ought to be entrusted with the future of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for another 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the Foreign Minister to stop this course of saying nothing and come out and express the views which I am sure the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> hold strongly in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years we were trying to get <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to work them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, in looking to this Bill I want to make it quite clear that the Opposition reaffirms its basic tenet that it stands for home ownership by <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, home ownership so that eople on average wages can own their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That whereas our constitutional parliamentary democracy was developed on the Rights of Magna Carta to preserve for all time to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> their cherished right to live as free men and women, enjoying complete liberty of worship, assembly, speech, movement, the communication of knowledge and information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Government prepared to give to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> some assurance, which they want, in the light of those facts? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All  I  know is that for the first time for many years the Australian Government is in the happy position where the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are concerned with domestic matters as are the people of other nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the presence of Australian police in Cyprus is approved by all political parties here and by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the reason the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not accept it as an alternative Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Government that in the 1974 policy speech the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were asked to think again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Gietzelt  dares to suggest that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ought to have confidence in the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, and in view of the deep distress felt by the Baltic community at the Government’s recognition of Soviet sovereignty over the Baltic States, will the Minister take steps to make amends to these worthy <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That whereas our constitutional parliamentary democracy was developed on the Rights ofthe Magna Carta to preserve for all time to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> their cherished right to live as free nien and women, enjoying complete liberty of worship, assembly, speech, movement, the communication of knowledge and information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have done it recently very much to the advantage and the enjoyment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and I think we will continue to do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest that the proposal contained in the Bill is in accordance with the wishes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provisions of this Bill will enable the valuable contribution made in past years by the defence service homes scheme to the housing of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to be maintained and improved upon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No doubt he has had his difficulties in attempting to get this industry established but I am sure he has done the best he possibly could do under the circumstances for the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It constitutes a Pandora’s box of various gifts that are to be given to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With this Bill the Government will make a three-pronged drive to improve the quality of life of our <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To do this we must provide an urban environment which includes all of the facilities and life style demanded by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and provide them at a reasonable cost The third part of our program is designed to arrest and to reverse the decline in the urban environment of our great cities, and to improve the services within them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The objectives of this program are to preserve and enhance land and buildings of beauty and of historic, environmental or scientific interest as a heritage for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It also has great value in the area of tourism not only to <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but also to people from other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> feel and have felt for a long time that the Broadcasting Control Board has a responsibility to determine what are to be regarded as children’s viewing programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that that is the wish of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and that they have believed that the Broadcasting Control Board always was vested with those powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this Parliament always thought that the Control Board was vested with those powers and that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> felt that the Broadcasting Control Board should have the responsibility to determine how much advertising is allowable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I consider that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want to ensure that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board has the power to determine what type of advertising should be allowed, for instance, during children’s viewing time and during family viewing time and so on, and that they believe there is a responsibility on the Board to determine how much programming should be of Australian origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But by rejection of this legislation all those things that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believe to be the responsibility of the Board under powers they thought were vested in it are going to be denied the Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We as a government have an overall responsibility to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  and I would have any basic difference in the general concept that we would each espouse that we want to see developed in this country a spirit of nationalism and a sense of loyalty of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to that nationalist ethos. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a tendency for some <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to be saying: ‘ We have to get our money out of the country’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been subjected to another long tirade of misrepresentation about the objectives of the Government by  Senator Carrick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the end of 1 974 we can say that the Australian Government has scored something like 430 good runs for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition Parties, of course, tried to come back in May 1974 but they misjudged and mistimed their attack and were well and truly run out as indeed they will be when the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a real opportunity and an objective opportunity to examine the legislative program of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They spend so much of the time in the Senate endeavouring to divert the attention of the Senate and of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from the positive programs of the Government, programs which clearly will take years before the full effects will be understood by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, but programs which will radically alter the growth patterns in our cities as we set out consciously to divert the population from the urban areas into the regional centres on which agreement has already been reached with the State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the adoption of the Bill because I believe it is a very important step forward in improving the life style ofthe <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These are the enterprises which employ the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the bonanza which the Government has reaped through taxation from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because of the effect of inflation on wages, it amazes me that the Government should resort to this paltry extraction of money from thrifty people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  has been trooping around the world like a glorified tourist at great expense to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst it is politically impossible at the moment, there ought to be a new referendum in Australia asking the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to give to the Australian Government the power to fix wages and salaries according to the measure of productivity in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that could be asked of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and if both parties would support it there would be a massive and overwhelming approval of it, such is the concern in the general community on this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Opposition in the Austraiian Parliament said to the Australian Government: ‘We urge you to go to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by way of referendum to obtain the power to fix wages and salaries as a measure directly indexed to the level of productivity, we will in return ensure that you go your full term of office without displacement by the Senate, the Labor Government would have every incentive to take that action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we in the Senate are becoming accustomed to this misuse of public moneys to advantage the Australian Labor Party, I think we ought to use every opportunity to inform the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the way in which this is being done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In dealing with the question of federalism as the responsible exercise of power, I refer to that sort of issue as showing something of the ill conceived nature of the view that State governments are somehow efficient in the interests of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and are somehow the bulwarks of freedom and the individual against authoritarianism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We look at it in contrast to the rather shabby Opposition that really has done nothing but try to undermine the confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and has put nothing forward other than these rather empty slogans to which I have referred in the much vaunted new federal platform of the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognise that although  Senator Button  purports to criticise it he has recognised that in that platform we have nailed down the real issues which are before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had a generation of such vitriol, such bile, here tonight when  Senator Walsh  showed the doctrinaire socialist’s 19th century hatred of the ordinary enterprise of ordinary Australians, and of all those values that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have cherished and have used to build Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the official figures for the period have totally discredited all the Minister’s statements on the economy, will the Minister admit his serious misleading of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and refrain in future from such grossly erroneous comments and predictions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus the policy of open government that is being pursued by this Government will be more effectively taken to all sections of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask honourable senators: In what way does the taxation situation that confronts the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> give any form of incentive that will lead to a strengthening of the vital sinew of economic growth- investment in plant and equipment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This volatile nature, this edginess, must surely be related to the lack of confidence, the uncertainty which is depriving industry and indeed the total <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of investment and employment opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this does in the long term- a not very long term- is to deny to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a large measure of investment and development and to deny to millions of policy holders, large, medium and small, the sort of bonuses that are desperately needed even more so in the inflationary circumstances of today than at any other time in the economic and social history of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason an adjournment is being sought is the political fear of members of the Liberal and Country Parties, the same political fear that they have shown in this chamber over the last 2 years when they have stupidly blocked legislation which was for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also accept the fact that the other night he was prepared to admit that when the proposal in relation to the powers over prices and incomes came before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> last year he did not support it, that he could not see the wisdom of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Hall,  as the then Premier of South Australia, did not tell the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that embodied in the negotiations he had with  Mr Bolte  was a hydro-electric scheme at Dartmouth from which the people of South Australia were not going to benefit but only the people of Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They also felt they should state that they think it is indefensible that the Government should plan to spend $1.58m on a campaign to promote the scheme, the objective of the campaign clearly being to urge the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to accept the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most recent poll conducted of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> showed that 56 per cent of the voters want to pay their own way and reject the concept of a compulsory health scheme as has been outlined by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In it he put forward some thoughts which should be considered by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when they are contrasting the present scheme, which is based on voluntary contributions, and the proposed Hayden health scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is really a debate about the means of proceeding and the way in which to proceed towards obtaining health cover for all the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the acceptance of what I think both the Government and Opposition see as a goal- the provision of health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told again today that recent Gallup polls show a larger percentage than last year of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in favour of the retention of a system of voluntary health insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would think that the Government would learn that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> prefer a gradual change to being forced to change from one system to another, the new one being of the type that all experience, everywhere in the world, has indicated will fail because it will become prohibitively expensive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is a great tragedy for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that this legislation is to be rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is being opposed by the Liberal Party and Country Party senators in this chamber, and history will prove that one way or the other the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will eventually get the sort of national health services that they deserve and that they want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst acknowledging the humour with which  Senator Wheeldon  treats the situation, it is something which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as indicated by their vote in Queensland last Saturday, do not regard in the same way as he does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-95-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the course of last year the Prime Minister on many occasions stated, and stated correctly, that the Government had been elected for a 3-year term to implement the policy which it had put before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, what are the Government’s plans to make frequency modulation facilities available to the widest range of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wish to report to the House and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on my recent mission abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stress that point because, for some weeks, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> witnessed a persistent and often unscrupulous campaign by sections of the media to deter me  from  my visit, and when I was not deterred, to disparage what I did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The response of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> was overwhelming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The response of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> was so overwhelming that the foodstuffs could not be shifted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would like to know a little more about how  Mr Hawke  can square these inconsistent utterances made in his differing capacities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Broken promises by this Government represent a cynical disregard for everything on which it went to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Opposition will have to make up its mind what it is going to do because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will want to know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> bought it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a democracy, that right rests with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are some of the things that are worrying the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be the obligation of the Federal Government to put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the earliest opportunity a referendum to alter the Constitution to put beyond doubt the method of choice of successors and to prevent the piracy which has been intended in this case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he assure the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that these serious findings will be rapidly checked and the conditions corrected? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Twice in a little over 2 years the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> quite clearly and quite definitely have elected the Australian Labor Party to govern this country for 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has pointed out on numerous occasions that the value of those resources should be protected for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as much as is possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Petroleum and Minerals Authority was established to enable it, the Australian Government and therefore the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to own and therefore to determine what happens to our oil reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should bear in mind as I have said at all times, that the Commission is and was presented to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as an independent body which would have the responsibility for the reconstruction of Darwin and that the task would not be one to be carried out by the Minister and his Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But clearly the national Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to ask: ‘What was wrong with the building code? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, will he give consideration to making a statement to the Parliament assuring the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that in the event of the United States carrying out its threat under no circumstances will Australian military forces be committed to aid or abet such intervention and /or any consequential action? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People could be ordered out of their homes and in those circumstances they could suffer some loss as a result They may have to find, in the obvious way, alternative accommodation and it might not be so easy to find the compensation for it in the same way as a generous <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> provided compensation in the immediate wake of the cyclone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my suggestion to this chamber that he has set out in a quite determined way to use that bludgeon to shape the Constitution more to his liking and into a form which is generally not acceptable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a principle which I think expresses in an important way the spirit of togetherness that ought to motivate the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a little strange that it took the ALP as long as it did to get on to the idea that section 96 could be used to solve the real problem that it has, namely, that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not want it to change the constitutional structure of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that the formation of an independent Australia Council will inaugurate a new era of vitality and progress in the arts, that creative artists of all kinds will enjoy a new measure of security and status in the community and that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole will have new and wider opportunities to participate in the arts and enjoy the emotional, spiritual and intellectual rewards which the arts alone can provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had an exercise forced on us by the Opposition in May last year and we had to say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>: ‘We are now being forced to spend an awful lot of the taxpayers money, your money, on holding another election.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer honourable senators to a letter dated 1 May 1974 which was immediately before the Opposition took the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the polls quite unnecessarily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the vehement denial of rights to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> I can only assume that the members of both the Liberal Party and the Australian Country Party find that they have a great deal to hide from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate  (Senator Withers),  I point out that the proposal embodied in this Bill was submitted to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by way of referendum not 9 months ago and on that occasion the people of Australia said no. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to be a strange twist of logic that 29 members of the Government Party are doing their utmost to establish conditions which will virtually say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Senate, as a responsible brake in the Australian parliamentary system, is totally unnecessary and we do not need it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so, surely the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> receive something of a continuing measure in their effort of guardianship over the legislation before the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other most significant feature of the Senate’s being elected in halves is that it provides the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- the electorate- with a real opportunity to pass judgment on the government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the grounds that the legislation is unnecessary- there is no clamour for it- that it has been rejected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> less than 12 months ago, that it would destroy the very significance of the Senate in the Australian parliamentary system and thereby be the prelude to its abolition and that it would deny the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> an opportunity to pass judgment on the government of the day as it proceeds along its course, I strongly oppose the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether or not those appeals should be abolished is for the States to negotiate with the English Parliament or, as I indicated, in negotiation with the Commonwealth and by referendum of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether or not that right of appeal should be taken away is a matter which could be rectified by a decision of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, if the Government were prepared to take that issue to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, or it could be resolved by arrangement between the States and the English Parliament, if the English Parliament were prepared to take that action at the request of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would much prefer to see this issue resolved within Australia and determined by referendum of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because it can be done by referendum and that would be consistent with the position which Australia ought to hold in the independent stature which it has now reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that is not a test of the wealth of emotion amongst the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; that is a test of the strength of the emotions of those honourable senators, which really is not the relevant factor in this discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But on this issue  Senator Greenwood  found some great value in the notion that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be called upon to decide this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator will be aware that a very large number of daily and weekly copies of Hansard are made available to a very large section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ultimately and desirably, we in the Opposition felt that the appeals should be abolished, if they were to be abolished, by decision of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a government we are not too proud to take something out of that wastepaper basket if we think it meets the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and nation in 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present Labor Government is the only political Administration that has tried to share Australia’s mineral wealth with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is the view of the Government that it may following an election find itself in a position to put a mass, a stockpile, of Bills before such a Joint Sitting, then in fact the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be witnessing a total reversal of the social and political history of this country at one fell swoop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am prepared to table extracts from the ‘Argus’ on various dates in 1933 which point up very dramatically that  Sir Robert  Gordon Menzies, then  Mr Robert  Gordon Menzies, Q.C., was prepared to do the same thing as honourable senators opposite are now doing and as their  Deputy  Leader tried to do in 1974 during the course of the election campaign following the double dissolution when he was advocating protection of multi-national foreign interests, which was not in the best interests of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This afternoon  Senator Carrick  said that he could not believe it was possible for the Australian Government, on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, to raise $300m a year to engage in exploration and exploitation of our mineral resources, because after all that is risk capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> not enjoy the benefits of that socalled investment of risk capital backed by the Australian Government in their own interests? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You are the sort of person, representing the so-called Opposition, who has deliberately blocked the opportunity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to enjoy that investment- risk capital, as you refer to it I do not wish to be unkind or to misrepresent the situation but honourable senators opposite have either been got at- I am trying to find the right word to be soft and kind about it- or alternatively represent somebody who has convinced them that it would be unwise to support a Bill relating to the disclosure of political funds that they rejected not for the first time but, to my knowledge, at least the second time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government was elected twice within 14 months on a pledge to acquire for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the benefits that could accrue from exploration and exploitation ofthe tremendous wealth that our mineral resources could provide for the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he think that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian Government representing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for the first time since 1949 could not find that sort of finance so that Australians may enjoy the benefits whose expatriation out of this country he has been prepared to support? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we can do that in war why can we not do it in peace in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the honourable senator who led for the Opposition really believe that we, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, cannot raise $300m a year to explore and exploit an industry which returns such wealth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are concerned about is that these natural assets on the Australian continent and off-shore within the area described by international law should belong to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and that they ought to enjoy the benefits of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mem bers of the UAP had to walk out of this place because they could not do anything to help the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in a crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the type of people the Opposition is prepared to back against the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will see the Opposition for what it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I and my Party are not prepared to accept that I do not believe for one moment that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are prepared to accept that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we could raise money to prosecute a war to defend this nation when the party to which honourable senators opposite belong could not gain the confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, I think we can do the same thing in peace time to the greater advantage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and for the future benefit of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government was elected in 1 972 and one aspect of its election platform was to protect the mineral resources of this country for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at least it is on the record that this Government has endeavoured to meet the obligations and commitments it made to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in 1972 and restated in 1974 which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> supported then and which they will support again in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have said consistently that the introduction at this time of a compulsory health scheme for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> does not have the support of us, as parliamentary representatives, or of the people upon whom it will be imposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill prohibits the payment of Commonwealth health benefits after a date to be proclaimed; that is, it removes the Government’s support from the voluntary health scheme which is now serving the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This measure will make illegal the continuity of voluntary health insurance funds as they are and as they serve the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Medibank starts on 1 July it will be necessary for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have access to some form of health insurance that will cover them for private hospital care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-It comes from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, just as the whole cost of this scheme will come from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To suggest that there has been anything free in the existing scheme or that there will be anything free in the proposed scheme is to overlook that government has to obtain funds from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and then appropriate them according to the programs which have passed through both Houses of the Australian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present voluntary scheme has been designed to cover the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and their needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been freely acknowledged that it has been a development which suited the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and progressively has maintained a system of health care which has served the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confrontation has occurred with the medical profession, with the private hospitals, with the ancillary services, with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> themselves, with the private hospital insurance funds and with all those people who are associated with a health scheme and who would be required to cooperate in its implementation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to translate that sort of ideology of socialism into the field of health care and the requirements of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, it would surely be appropriate for a responsible Opposition to say again to the Government: ‘Retreat from your socialist plans in this country and acknowledge that health care cannot be dismantled overnight’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps we could improve the existing scheme to provide additional opportunities for health to be delivered to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be of great advantage not only to the efficiency of the service but to the spirit and the feeling of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in regard to the society in which they live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not believe that all the plans or discussions that should have been undertaken with those people who will be required to implement the service have been completed to the satisfaction and, indeed, to the knowledge of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am personally disappointed that the Opposition, having been involved in this series of debates over many years, has put forward no alternative proposition which has attracted the attention or imagination of any of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It sets out to remove from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> benefits they presently enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The overwhelming majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> showed very clearly on 2 occasions that they are in favour of our national health scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that by now it would have been perfectly clear to honourable senators that the great majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had accepted this idea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it would operate in open competition and would not have access, by compulsory transfer and draft, to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s savings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can make their own decisions as to what they want to do with their savings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact remains that on 13 November 1972 my Leader, who is now the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  gave an undertaking to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Government would do 2 things in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, with respect to what  Senator Cotton  has said, the National Investment Fund and the AIDC in effect will be competing on the open market for what funds are available for investment and they will not, as  Senator Cotton  has suggested, intrude upon the free choice of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to invest because they will have an opportunity of looking at a statement that the Corporation has prepared setting out a series of investments and the terms and conditions upon which bonds will be issued and sold in that series and they will be able to compare that with, let us say, a similar statement prepared by the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works or any other body outside of the governmental and semi-governmental institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that over a number of years, through the assistance of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> via the government of the day, irrespective of the colour of its politics, both Australian and foreign interests have been assisted and encouraged to explore for and exploit our mineral resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have found on balance that if the special provisions of taxation on the one hand and the concessions of subsidies on the other were measured against the payments back to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in terms of taxation and royalties they would show that the Australian community has been in fact subsidising those companies to quite a substantial tune and, more importantly, that those companies have been accruing unto themselves extraordinary returns on their investments which in my view could not be condoned by even the Opposition if it were prepared to concede the point I have made and I think that it would be prepared to do so privately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is to be said to be the way in which we are to fund the exploration for and exploitation of our natural resources and /or to assist our own secondary industries and rural industries, why should that sort of technique and that philosophy not be employed through the representatives of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as elected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and not through the board of directors of company A or company B? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me place on record the Government’s conviction that both of these Bills would be to the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there has been some recognition over the years that some of the development projects of the country which have been entered into purely for profit motive may well not have been entered into or that there could have been fewer resources directed into that area and that other things could have been done which would have been of more benefit to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope to spend the rest of my life there and to give my musical and cultural life to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have a situation where $70m of public expenditure is now placed to support the operations of the Australian Broadcasting Commission when that money had formerly been drawn from individual <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps in the future some of the money which we now seem to waste on universities may be more appropriately directed to a body such as the Australia Council because it will give by its activities a wider range of options to a greater number of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the growth of financial institutions catering largely for the middle income earners, there never has been a Government policy directed at the housing needs of that energetic and deserving section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- those above the level of direct need, but who yet require a marshalling of the resources of the community if they are to attain the high quality home which should be the heritage of every family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real problem for us all in Australia is somehow to persuade the Australian community and its governments, including ourselves, to get our total demands in a reasonable relationship with the ability of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and society to provide resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that the Opposition is threatening in words through  Mr Anthony  to precipitate an election on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> which the public does not want about a scheme which the Opposition does not then want to make the central theme of the election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask honourable senators to go back to their Party and to tell their Leader to make himself quite clear in his statements to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, to stop using the absurd phrases that he used yesterday and to say quite clearly to the Australian public what he is going to do and what he recommends about these issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They shared, and encouraged the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to accept, a delusion about the nature of the conflict in IndoChina. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this immediate emergency, no government has been more active, more concerned and, reflecting the wishes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, more generous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And it is worth noting the real reason why the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> expect their Government so to act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have accepted the truth, the bitter truth, that the intervention into which they were led was disastrously wrong, that it only increased and lengthened the agony of Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have acknowledged the truth in the same way that the American people and the American Congress have acknowledged it, but is the truth of the disaster acknowledged by its authors and their abettors? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the very wide powers and perhaps the intention that these powers suggest for the winding up and management of the health funds do lead into an area where, if this Bill were given assent and were enacted, these gaps could not be covered for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would also make it extremely difficult for the health funds to provide a program for the future to cover whatever areas of health insurance may be required by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If they are to operate commercially and profitably it will be necessary for them to pursue whatever areas of health insurance are required by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions which talk about the special account are important but I think what we should draw attention to at this time, in the interests of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, is the need for them to continue to undertake private health insurance for private hospital cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister and his Ministers made it abundantly clear that they proposed to use a massive and continuous credit squeeze to dry up any money from the housing industry and to ally to that the highest interest rates in the history of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- an interesting phenomenon from a Party whose platform contains a pledge to lower interest rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will talk about South Australia in a moment, lt is well to remind the honourable senator and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that when the Whitlam Government took office this country had the proudest housing record of any country on earth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the reason for this discrimination when all the terms of this Bill could have been applied to all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> if there had been negotiation and consultation with the States and the ordinary construction authorities in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But if there are constitutional limitations covering all of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, why is the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement not ultra vires the Constitution? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can learn just what benefit is to be gained from a Commonwealth dollar spent in this industry as against the alternative methods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Will the Minister give to the Senate and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> some indication of just what our rights and entitlements will be in the future in relation to this basic issue of where and how we live? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to know whether the Australian Government sent cables which were directed at apportioning blame equally or whether the cables indicate that the Government is more receptive to one side than it is to the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would far rather have that criticism from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> than criticism that we were giving too much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Today the things we have said, with orphans having come to this country, with students already here, with aeroplanes involved, with nearly $3,500,000 already spent in South Vietnam aid, are in sharp contrast with the bitter sort of speech we heard from  Senator Withers  and with the record of the Opposition in Vietnam of 425 <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> dead and 2400 wounded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are confronted again, as we have been for the last 20-odd years, with the same rhetoric, the same concepts of deceit, lies and the basing of arguments on fear and emotion to try to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that in the Asian region there is some sort of threat to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have sought to bring themselves to a position in which they can regain the Treasury benches of this country by moving motions such as this one, in the vain and inane hope that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be beguiled as they were in the 1950s by the erroneous policies which were pursued by the parties which they represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again we hear  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack and those other cold war warriors endeavouring to talk about communism, the thrusts, the hordes of Asia and all those emotive terms which beguiled the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the 1950s and 1960s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that,  Sir Robert  Menzies said that the thrust, and the threat facing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> was the thrust and the threat from China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, no Chinese soldiers have been found there in the last decade, since the Menzies Administration illegally committed the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to intervene as a Western power in a civil war that had been raging in the country of Vietnam for centuries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The hypocrisy of the members of the Opposition knows no bounds and I hope that the commonsense of the Senate and of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will never allow them to be hoodwinked again by the propaganda of the Liberal and Country Parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We collaborate and co-operate with our allies, but we do not get dragged along by the nose and do things that we are told to do that are against the very best principles of democracy, and against the very best principles of the Australian nation and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that, in the light of what has happened in the past, we can expect these minority groups to operate again in places like Malaysia, Burma, Indonesia and the small island city of Singapore, because they are there now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is trying to put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it is purely a local matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would like to know just where this Government stands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is not prepared to do that, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The charges outlined in the statement of the matter of urgency are of the sort that are causing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a great deal of concern about our ultimate security and survival. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The imminent collapse of the non-communist regime in South Vietnam presents to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian Government some serious challenges and new situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It calls upon the Government to come out very clearly and to respond not only to the degrees of doubt which are in the minds of members of the Parliament today but also to the degrees of concern which are running right through the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and to provide the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with the opportunity to assist particularly the people in Vietnam to determine their own future and live a life of freedom and satisfaction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that they have made a serious mistake in bringing before the Senate this lame, laborious and dreary debate which we have heard from them today, because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know very well what happened in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, particularly those who are interested in this legislation, will be impressed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would think that whatever the report of the Committee may say and whatever recommendations the Committee may or may not make the revelations which were made because of the Committee ‘s activity in themselves were of very great importance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in understanding just how the economy of their country has been managed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a Government we are quite competent to see that the construction of the Trans-Australian Railway from Tarcoola to Alice Springs will be carried out in the best possible fashion and that it will be a credit to the Government and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it has been recognised by many commentators- people who are not socialists but who are vitally concerned in the private enterprise sector of the Australian economythat the life offices have had an undue concentration on the building of office blocks and real estate developments in the central business districts of the Australian cities, which have not been of any great advantage to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government is interested in electoral justice it will not press those sections of the Bill which seek electoral advantage for a particular party or for the present parties at the expense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The optional preferential system, insofar as it leads logically to the elimination of preferential voting and to the establishment of first past the post voting, must contribute to the destruction of choice for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Scott  also claimed that we do not get good government under minority parties, but he conveniently forgot that between 1949 and 1972 the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> suffered a government which was propped up by minority parties, firstly by the Country Party as a coalition partner and then in this chamber by the Democratic Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this case, in the interests of the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the Government has an obligation to pay the costs which could be incurred by  Senator Webster  before the High Court because the case will be dealing with the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> cannot afford to be misled in this way in such a delicate area as foreign affairs and the security of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are concerned here in charges of misleading the Parliament and with a comparison of the conduct of members on this side with that of members of the Opposition in the matter of dealing honestly with the Parliament and with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not only a deception of one day or one phrase; it was a long, drawn out, carefully calculated deception of the Parliament, of the government of the day and of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by the leaders of that Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I guess it is to embarrass the Government, particularly the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  and to divide the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into 2 camps on the issue more definitely than they were divided before this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wonder whether  Senator Everett  was trying to deceive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because there was no question that the Prime Minister was asked about the cables. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A month ago the Senate Committee asked a question of the responsible Minister about these expenditures which are expenditures out of the public purse, to be paid for by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> either now in taxation or later in the process of having to pay for loans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government Liaison Service has been established on the premise and on the principle that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a right to know what is going on in a democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, the Government is paying the salaries of 3 officers from government finances to make an international tour to defame the Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Once there are strict criteria, one must of necessity, I believe, find that a number of people who with the exercise of a bit of common sense and with a bit of humanity should have received donations from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by way of compensation will not have received anything. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to be the nature of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that if they are not happy about what is happening they growl about it and make their opinions known to their neighbour, their political representative or somebody else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Substantially the Bill seeks to re-educate the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, to bring about the understanding that all men are brothers and that race is not a question that ought to divide us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One does not have to talk to many migrants or many Aborigines to appreciate how much they react to the attitude that exists amongst so many of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, to realise the alienation and confusion felt by the children of migrants in our schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently a 12-year-old Jewish boy who was subjected to racial comment and abused on a football field felt so incensed, because he believed that was living in a free society and because he believed in the policies of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that he sought the telephone number of the Australian AttorneyGeneral in order to lodge his complaints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I trust that as a result of certain amendments being carried this legislation will finally emerge as good, effective and just legislation and legislation that is actually able to achieve, in a way in which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would desire it, the elimination of whatever discrimination is present in our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Irrespective of political attitudes, these increases are of such magnitude that they impose potentially great dangers on Australia and its economic position, leading, I believe, to a massive acceleration in inflation possibilities and, out of all that, to the concern that I have always expressed in this place, namely, the possible destruction of the Australian currency and the future of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another aspect that concerns me is that it has been announced that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  says that he will spend $500,000 on advertising in order to inform the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what inflation is and what it is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of talking about what inflation is, I think that if the Government made a clear statement about what steps it will take to reduce inflation it would give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> much more confidence and happiness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to his question about the Government’s campaign to make the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> more aware of the matter of inflation and its effects on all of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In either case, the Opposition would be guilty of gross derelicition of its obligations to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and to the States, if it allowed this Bill to slip through as the Government would like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are sick and tired of the opposition that comes from the ill-informed parliamentary Opposition in this House and which has continued to come from it ever since 2 December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite wrong to suggest that this action was taken by the Government without a proper indication, not only to the Opposition but also to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of what it intended to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He can tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what is the Government’s platform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we hear from Opposition senators who clearly do not understand the Bill, who clearly want to get on to the antisocialist bandwagon, who clearly want to parade the catch-cries and the bogeys, who clearly do not want to accept their legislative responsibility to understand what this Bill seeks to do; who want rather to try to parade before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the view that this Bill has some ulterior motivation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is not that precisely the motivation of this Government, recognising the more complex society upon which our country now exists and recognising that transportation has a new dimension in respect of the comfort and needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One thing that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must know about this Government is that it is determined to protect the interests of the consumers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill will give the Australian Government the opportunity, for example, to look at the absurdity of the current 2-airline policy, not so much at the services that the 2 companies provide for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but at the existing timetables and the way in which those companies compete for passenger traffic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All that  Mr Whitlam  sought to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in his policy speech on behalf of the Labor Party in December 1 972 was this: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is now revealed is a great confidence trick which was played on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by the Labor Party and some of its supporters in the newspapers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regardless of whether it is a Curriculum Development Centre, a Schools Commission, a Technical and Further Education Commission, or whatever it is, this Government has a duty to offer and present to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> regular evaluations to show that the bodies concerned are actually achieving something. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their ideas and thoughts will be conveyed to my colleague the Minister for Education and they will be taken into consideration because, after all, education is of vital concern to all Australian children and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we would want to emphasise that we recognise the need for technical education to have some priority when competing for funds for education in the near future, because it is fair to say that there is need for improvement in many of the opportunities in technical education which we would like to see available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What he forgets is that the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not want to have a multiracial society; they want to have a homogeneous society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The objective is to try to bring the indigenous <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> up in social terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I have said is what I repeat, namely, that the Australian Government Insurance Corporation in its commercial activities will be completely competitive with other insurance offices and it will be engaging in fields of national interest insurance which are of vital importance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but in which the private insurance offices have not engaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate, in this particular case- as indeed in other cases that will emerge- has a huge responsibility to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to itself in its scrutiny of measures of this massive consequence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that it will have the support of all the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because it is an entirely new idea and I think it is an extremely good idea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat that the test of a housing scheme is whether it produces a sufficiency of homes for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because of this they have directed a new campaign at the senators opposite which may also have the same reverse effects, particularly in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe the Board of the AGIC will follow a wise investment program which will benefit the policy holders, the private sector, and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> far more than some existing insurance offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is essential that this legislation be approved now because of the amount of preparation necessary before the AGIC will be able to offer policies to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It can become a leader in its field in Australia- on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at that one sees that the real purpose of income tax concessions granted to the life insurance industry, as I understood it at the time, was to induce the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to become as strong as they could in their personal savings habits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be very upset if I saw any attempt to water down the savings of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and their savings habits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sooner this can be brought home to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the better and I raised these instances for that purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does the Government not make that perfectly clear to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that there should be a medical service, which is largely free, for the whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To do more than that- to promise people things they really cannot have; to lift expectations beyond reality- is to be unfair to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and unwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the massive area in this Government’s proposals- right across the board- of spending or committing expenditure well beyond the capacity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to make the resources available to meet those things is, to say the least of it, a piece of sleight of hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This piece of legislation represents a compromise in respect of the demands of those employed in the Public Service and represents the financial responsibility that we considered the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should accept for the new benefits suggested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been a pacesetter in causing massive concern to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are looking at the broad argument that to update the total pension in accordance with the CPI would place a cost burden on the system of Government revenue and increase further the disparity and unfairness between 2 classes of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- those who are employed by the Australian Government and those who are selfemployed or are employed by other people in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I only wish the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> could see  Senator Wright  as well as hear him, although I imagine that hearing him is sufficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any suggestion that management of the news can be undertaken through the amendments which have been introduced, we believe, is something which would be resisted by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To suggest that no commercial interest would be able to develop that new form of technological advance in radio is to suggest that large numbers of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not to have sound of this quality as soon as they otherwise would. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe this again is an intrusion through government policy into what ought to belong to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and what should be competed for in the form of licences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this aspect of government patronage is one of the vices which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must recognise as having been developed in fine degree by this Government, and it is one of those aspects of the Bill which does give the Opposition a great deal of concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The claim was made so eloquently by the Postmaster-General  (Senator Bishop)  in his second reading speech that both these organisations should work together for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is important that attention was drawn to the fact that the establishment of the Australian Telecommunications Commission could well involve the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in very greatly increased costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that this should be noted because it is something to which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian Government must be alert for in the operation of communications organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I leave it to the judgment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to decide whether  Mr Lynch  was giving an authentic document. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-I will say that any letter of a similar nature from any company claiming that it has a mandate from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to negotiate loans is incorrect in its contents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Senate and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be interested to know that these procedures have shown that at least to a certain extent the unemployment figures in this country have been artificially inflated and that this artificial inflation has been reduced, if not eliminated, by the introduction of more efficient procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister seriously suggest that there is no basis for the concern of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> over the attempts to by-pass established Treasury procedures? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the substantial problem facing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, facing the Government, facing the Senate and facing the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So one begins to feel that we may be considering some kind of compulsion on Australian domestic savings lying ahead of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> if they are to fund the acts of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are talking about a future charge upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I trust that during the course of the debate other speakers on the Government side will be able to demonstrate to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in various ways the total falsity of the arguments and of the alleged case that has been instigated by  Mr Phillip  Lynch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet it is being asserted that the Government can use other means to do the things which have to be done on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Treasury is to deal on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on markets throughout the world, I think it goes into those markets in the future with less credibility than it had in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Parliamentary Ministers are responsible for the administration and the relationship with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are talking about loan borrowings overseas on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the need for it arise from the fact that the Senate refused to pass the National Investment Fund Bill because we felt there was no protection for the savings of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in that Bill and in the purposes for which the Government wished to apply the money in the so-called national interest? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government believe that attempts to borrow large sums of money outside Australia and outside established Treasury procedures will remain secret from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, that asset is a great asset of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make that appeal to them in the name of the whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>That the Senate is of the opinion that the Government has failed to give to the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a proper, full and accurate account of the activities of its Ministers, servants and agents, relating - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for this reason that we are prepared, and continue to be anxious, to borrow sums of money on this scale on the best of all possible security, namely our own country, its wealth of resources, and the integrity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally, there was no aspect of our program which received more support from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in 2 elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw one opportunity through which the objectives so strongly supported by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the last 2 elections could be pursued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purposes for which we sought the loan command the clear support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have shown their clear support for our objectives in promoting Australian control of Australian resources which in the final analysis is nothing short of Australian control of Australia ‘s destiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the perspective of these great objectives, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will despise the pettiness, the self-serving, of those who have chosen this issue to undermine the fulfilment of those objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At end of motion add-  but the Senate is of the opinion that the Government has failed to give to the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a proper, full and accurate account of the activities of its Ministers, servants and agents, relating to all dealings by them both prior to and subsequent to the Executive Council Meeting of 13 December 1974, which authorized the Minister for Minerals and Energy to borrow a sum not exceeding four thousand million dollars in the currency of the United States of America for temporary purposes, and because the Government refuses to appoint a Royal Commission with proper and adequate terms of reference to investigate and report upon all aspects of the Government’s overseas loan activities, the Senate resolves- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But if the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are going to have inflicted upon them after Saturday a coalition government made up of 3 disunited groups, all I can say is: God help the people of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#debate-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That Resolution recites the Senate’s opinion ‘that the Government has failed to give to the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a proper, full and accurate account of the activities of its Ministers, servants and agents, relating to all dealings by them both prior to and subsequent to the Executive Council Meeting of 13 December 1974, which authorized the Minister for Minerals and Energy to borrow a sum not exceeding four thousand million dollars in the currency of the United States of America for temporary purposes’ and states that the Senate resolves that a number of named persons of whom I am one be called to the Bar of the Senate ‘to answer questions upon these matters’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750715_senate_29_s64/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hear someone groaning on the Opposition side because he does not want the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> really to understand what this is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is critically important that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not fooled by all this controversy about overseas loans, that they understand clearly what we have been trying to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps we have not been successful at this stage in obtaining those moneys but as long as the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can understand that the alternative is a government that is trying to ensure that we have control of the destiny of our national resources, as opposed to an Opposition which would give those resources away to people overseas, they will know the key issue that we are talking about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I find most offensive about this sort of view is the suggestion that the Government in some way has set about in criminality and conspiracy to deceive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it offensive as a view coming from somebody like  Senator Greenwood  who participated in the greatest government deception of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of all time- the deception on the decision to enter the Vietnam war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If ever there was deceit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, if ever there was an attempt to conspire, it was by the Liberal Party Government in relation to our entry into the Vietnam war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those figures might give the Australian public some idea of the type of frustration, the deep seated frustration, that this Government, duly elected on 2 occasions by a mandate of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, still has had to suffer at the hands of the combined Opposition parties in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is about time that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> realised that the Opposition is vilifying and traducing, living by way of innuendo after innuendo, day after day, dragging senior public servants, and now individual members of the Australian public, to the Bar of this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have funds available for investment and I take  Senator Cotton  upon his point at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled, as a matter of contract, to insure themselves against the various risks of life with a government agency if they wish to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That hysterical opposition has rivalled that which was engendered in relation to Medibank, which is now alive and well and serving the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think that the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are satisfied with what Medibank is doing for them and, except in those States where there has been obstruction to the program, it has been saving considerable amounts of money each week in respect of the services it offers to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that three times tax mechanisms were brought in to obstruct the life offices in the 1 973-74 Budget; again last year and now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Father will take the investment in insurance and assurance and turn it to what he knows best- to put the assets of investment where he thinks best- not where a mutual company acting on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> thinks it ought to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Everett made the extraordinary statement that one of the reasons why we should do something to intervene in the insurance field was that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were at the mercy of many of these insurance companies, and that many of these companies are ailing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to devote more time to thinking up ways of fiddling the electoral system than it does to looking after the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The elected Government of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is not going to be answerable to the vested interests, the minority groups and the institutions which, over the last 6 months, have waged an infamous propaganda campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me refer to what the Prime Minister said in his policy speech in April 1974 when referring to the program for which we were seeking the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not draw to the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the fact that our financial institutions make us a mere colony of the United States of America and England, that the views represented by those interests are not always in the best interests of Australia, and that in some instances they have reached the point of arrogance as they no longer strive to provide the fullest of covers demanded by this Government and demanded by an aware public with a developed social conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They may well have the numbers in this chamber to defeat the legislation but if they believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> support their activities, that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are happy with private insurance activities in this country, they are out of touch with reality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I look forward to that day because on that day the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be afforded the insurance benefits which are surely their due. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill is suffering the fate of a series of Bills which have been presented to the Senate during the past  Vh  years for which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have voted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Technically the right is there if the British Parliament chooses to exercise that power but we believe that in a matter where the Australian nation has the power to determine these questions for itself the Australian nation, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, should be asked to make the decision, not the British Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We desire to see the appeal to the Privy Council removed entirely, and we trust that in due course the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be given the opportunity to do it in a way which is consistent with this nation’s independence and with the verdict of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, but to do it in a way which invites a British Parliament to legislate for Australia is, we believe, not only inconsistent with Australia’s independence but also a most remarkable instance of the inconsistency of the Prime Minister who, having adopted one view when in Opposition, chooses in power, to adopt a course which reflects our dependence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that they should be welcome on the basis of guidelines that point out that we want them to become established as good Australian organisations and that within 8 or 10 years of their establishment they should by a natural process shed at least 50 per cent of their shareholding to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be noted that there is an increase of 50 per cent on the amounts previously payable by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for prescriptions they require under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact, however, is not that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not understand the Government; it is that the communications gap has arisen because the Government does not understand the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Never has there been a government that has so capriciously betrayed its own supporters and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, through this Budget, will go down as the great betrayer of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To anyone other than the Government, the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes this Budget is a hoax and a confidence trick upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is now an overriding obligation to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about the budgetary situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that, and I believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would support us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a government which has betrayed the trust of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who have had to suffer because of past economic errors of this Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a very important development so far as the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That call is based on a frank recognition of the fact that the aspirations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have, over a number of years, outrun the possibilities of fulfilment of those aspirations in an economic sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is dealing with <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the rate of 10 000 a month, people who come to it in search of advice about the numerous problems which ordinary citizens in this community have, people who have not been in the habit of going to see solicitors about those problems, for a variety of reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>especially important for the Australian Press and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have a clear sense of the basic approach and philosophy of the Opposition Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does freedom mean choice in the hands of a few select individuals or does it mean choice in the hands of the whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government needs to restore the economy, objectivity and purpose for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, just as they broke their promises in 1950, 1951 and 1952 and adopted measures as harsh as I related previously, they will again make idle promises in 1975 or whenever it will be the ill fortune of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have to suffer them on the treasury bench. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, in making that sort of attack on that part of the economy the Government is in fact attacking an area of significant investment to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, an area of significant employment and an area concerned with a large measure of economic and social development in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The police are an important part of government for the regulation of the lives of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and I should have thought that we would all be looking for the most efficient force possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now this Government says that the Defence Force ReOrganization Bill 1 975, a Bill which goes to the heart of the security of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, is not important enough to refer to a committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The spokesman that I am coming back to now, that is, the spokesman for the Leader of the Opposition, said that the Medibank legislation had been passed 3 times by the Parliament and had been endorsed twice by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a system which, despite all of the criticisms which have come from the Australian Medical Association and the General Practitioners Society and those who represent them, has growing acceptance not only amongst the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally but also amongst the medical profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that basically the most important things that have been said in recent days to assist the understanding of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the intentions of the Government are contained, firstly, in the Chifley memorial lecture of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and, secondly, in the penultimate paragraph of the Budget Speech of the Treasurer  (Mr Hayden). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in the ultimate the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will answer and say that the Labor Party is honest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made some sweeping statements about the vital tax changes and about the benefits that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would have from them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can the Government claim that these tax changes are to be of more benefit to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> than Medibank, an expansion of expenditure of $ 1,400m, when we place into context that there is to be an expected 22 per cent increase in wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is something phoney about the tax figures and I believe that the Government ought to explain to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> where the tax juggling has occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other thing that ought to be brought home to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the present time is that they need not expect this week’s pay packet to reflect the taxation adjustments because the deductions will not take effect until 1 January next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures show that the pay as you earn tax component this year in the total wages and salaries of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is rising, and that is something that ought to be explained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But a comparison of those 2 factors in this year’s Government program as being of benefit to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will need to be done at the end of the year, and such a comparison should not be based on the promises which we have heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are now firm in the belief that we must be taking some action to improve production and to revive the capacity for investment by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has no better plans now than it had in May 1974 when it misled the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and produced advertisements which were clearly untrue and misleading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the last couple of years we have seen some unions that occupy key positions in our community using their power to raise their incomes, regardless of the needs of the rest of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it ought to be supported by the Parliament and by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have not faced up to their responsibilities and they have not endeavoured to understand the strategy that is before the Australian Government and before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were elected in 1972 with a mandate from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to bring about massive social changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Twenty-three years had passed in which the living standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, when one looks at the per capita gross national product of this country, had slipped behind the living standards in comparable countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since it has been in office the Government has endeavoured to raise the standard of living of all the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We intend to pursue the same objectives of bringing about the participation of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> whatever the result may be of any action taken by the Tory Government in Victoria to defeat the legislation in the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be that in some instances we have attempted to do too much too quickly, but we have attempted to do things that are of benefit to the great mass of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the general opinion of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is that this country is in a real mess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these pieces of art are kept in Canberra how many <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will see them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are no more in touch with the thinking of the average woman in Australia than Gough Whitlam is in touch with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister inform the Senate of the reasons why those important and valuable specimens were not purchased by the Government on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget provides for Government outlays of $21.9 billion - $2 1,915m - to be exacted from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and paid out by the great panjandrum who presides over the Treasury at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister cause an investigation of this nefarious practice to be launched with a view to eradicating this rip-off of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We feel that this is something in which the Aboriginal organisations themselves not only could but should play a role as this is a disease which primarily affects their people- at least, much more than it does any other section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget is a mere stop-gap measure and is nothing more than the old sugar and castor oil ploy by which the Government is once more attempting to dope or to dupe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also believe that if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have money in savings banks, which they want to invest voluntarily in domestic loans, that is without exception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By his statement the Minister has signified that the Government recognises- I think this is very important- that the Cocos (Keeling) Islands are sovereign territories of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and are a sovereign part of the Australian mainland in exactly the same way, I suggest- whatever is the constitutional difference between Queensland and the Australian Government- as islands in the Torres Strait are an integral part of the Australian mainland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s attitude is that we have been elected for 3 years by a mandate of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750930_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support it because I believe it’s a good Bill and in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have it passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750930_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s attitude is that we have been elected for 3 years by a mandate of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the strongest criticisms that can be made of the insurance offices is that they have not been putting the vast sums available to them and at their command to the most useful purposes for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that the Australian wool industry or the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want to see a repetition of the situation of Australian wool being shipped away overseas at virtually giveaway prices, as it was 5 or 6 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that those people who helped to circulate those rumours have not done a service to the Australian wool industry or the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although, as I have said, I do not believe that this is going to bring about any serious reduction in the amount of advertising or have any terrible effects on the commercial broadcasting industry, even if it were to have some effects on them I think that most honourable senators would agree that the effect which the previous latitude allowed to advertisers of therapeutic products was having on the health of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> was a more important consideration than the profits of commercial broadcasting stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have an enormous interest in 2 things- in the welfare of those who work in the mines and in the steel industry, and above all in the 13 million <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who will have for posterity coal as one of their most precious minerals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My plea is that, when we take a tonne of coal out of the ground in Australia, we should get for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the best value we can. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, if we contribute to the research of the world so that in future a tonne of coal will be equal to 3, 4 or 5 tonnes now, we not only conserve coal but we raise the international value of a tonne of coal and therefore convert it, in terms of the profit it makes, into real things for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I made the point also that the coal industry is enormously capital hungry and that if it is to do for Australia what it must do in the future, that is, to earn real treasure for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole, we must encourage in the industry the ploughing back of capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition’s remedy, if one accepts its argument, is that we should look after the multi-national organisations to ensure that their profits are not disturbed and to ensure that their profits are in fact increased at the expense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>By various sorts of incentives, as that Government’s supporters called them, and by its inability to claim proper royalties for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, it let its multinational friends dig great holes in the ground, take away the minerals and sell them at a very great profit to themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It went to great pains to ensure that very little money came back to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who owned the minerals in the first place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I might explain, I propose to do that to indicate that prior to 2 December 1972 the Government of this country was exploited by the multi-national mining companies and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were neglected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if natural minerals are being exploited for a profit motive the environment ought to be protected, the health of the workers ought to be protected, decent standards and working conditions ought to be the order of the day and there ought to be a fair return of profit to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor insists on a balanced development, on orderly marketing in the minerals area, on a proper return to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of revenue derived from the exploitation of mining fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought to realise when we are considering this matter that we are looking at enormous resources of coal, and if the resources are enormous the capacity to benefit the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by a reasonable export levy in this area ought to be apprehended and appreciated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, Australia has enormous reserves which, unless the Government steps in in the manner in which it does under this Bill, will result in the exploitation of immensely valuable Australian resources without any appropriate benefit for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we consider the question of benefit to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> let it be remembered that the export coal industry in Queensland is 85 per cent in foreign hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That change has taken place during the ministry of  Mr Connor  as a direct result of his deliberate policy that he would no longer tolerate the digging of our resources in the interests of foreign companies and their sale overseas with very little benefit to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, other than the employment this produced and some State taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those figures illustrate that prior to December 1972 there had been no proper effort by the then Australian Government to take appropriate action to ensure that a fair return was obtained for the vast exports that were going from Australia with very little benefit to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances what is wrong with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> reaping some benefit? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Everett and other speakers on behalf of the Government say that that is a jolly good thing, that Utah Corporation and other multinational companies are ripping off and raking off giant profits and it is good that we are going to get $ 120m out of them for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The actual yield to the Australian Government and through it to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be an estimated $69m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I venture to suggest that the result of the election of 12 July reflected the thoughts of the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on the matter before the Senate tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The actions have been condemned by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and  Senator Georges  should not try to wrap himself now in some sort of moral attitude as though he is the only person in the Senate who feels as he does on that matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am quite sure that no one section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would expect to derive from the system benefits which others did not derive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751002_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wanted to make only these few remarks because I think there is a message somewhere for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751007_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On great social issues some churches are looking for political kudos instead of backing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751007_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In my opinion, it is time we did the job the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> elected us to this Parliament to do, whether in government or in opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751007_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as my Department, and the statutory bodies for which I am responsible are concerned, various information activities are carried out which provide the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with basic facts concerning their rights and responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751007_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-55-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think it is of any benefit to the working people of this country, and I do not think it is of any benefit to the legitimately unemployed people of this country, that there should be those who deliberately take advantage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in order to receive unemployment benefits when they are making absolutely no effort whatsoever to obtain any work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thank goodness for the common sense of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, if the Government promotes the view that the reason for that is that those electorates have a slower growth rate it is surely condemning any claim it makes about being concerned with decentralisation, with the vast cross-section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wonder whether there is any area in which Labor can actually claim success, other than the success of forcing on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the ideology of socialism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But finally the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> decided that this was not good enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Bills give a very clear indication that the Government is more concerned with holding on to office than with using that office for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is trying to put forward to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the idea that the Senate is rejecting its measures for the purpose of creating a double dissolution situation when in effect, as far as this measure is concerned, the Senate is rejecting it because the Opposition really and truly believes that the measures are unfair to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Minister’s answer is yes, will he advise the Senate on what basis, other than faith in the integrity of the Minister as an individual, the Senate and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can have confidence in such undertakings from Ministers of this Government in the light of the conflicting statements made by  Mr Connor  and  Mr Khemlani  with respect to the history of attempts to raise loans overseas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It meant that the company which was selling the crude oil to them was able to make a tidy profit in excess of $ 1 m. What a state of affairs it is when almost every night the Federal  President  of the Australian Labor Party appears on television castigating the multinational corporations, accusing them of fleecing and exploiting the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, while at the same time he is agreeing, in defiance of his own Government- of his own Party’s policy- to benefit one of those overseas companies by $ 1 m. It is an absolutely scandalous situation, and there has not been enough revelation of what  Mr Hawke  and his colleagues were doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me assure him that, so far as I am concerned, if there has to be an election it will be fought on the issues that concern the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and not on the manoeuvrings that take place inside the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is for the Prime Minister to table those documents if they exist- presumably they do- and then for the Parliament or the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to make a judgment as to whether I and others were properly, informed by  Mr Connor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those on the other side of the chamber who say ‘hear, hear’ show to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the horrible alternative that faces them in the event of the Opposition bringing about the constitutional crisis which it is seeking to bring about in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst I can say that he raised some doubt about the capacity of the Government to raise this sort of money- I think  Senator Walsh  pointed out in his contribution yesterday the success which the Government had met in the last loan borrowings- I have no doubt that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would respond to the launching of this Loan Bill for the purpose particularly of financing the Government’s defence expenditure, or two-thirds of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That tirade of abuse was delivered because at no stage will the Opposition accept the verdict which arose from the decision of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in May 1974, which arose from the decision of the Joint Sitting and which finally developed into a judgment of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This gave us in the Opposition our first cause for alarm and apprehension and the first indication of the shape of the Budget to come and the difficulties we might well be confronted with not only as a Senate but as a group of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> concerned with the general wellbeing of our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have no opinions from learned counsel or professors of law but I do put to the Senate that the position at present is that in December 1972 and again in May 1974 the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> elected a Labour government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we are debating now relates to the National Health Act and the obtaining of information from the pharmaceutical companies so that the Australian Government, that is the Department of Health, in negotiating the prices of drugs will have information available to it which will enable it to approach the matter in a sensible way with all the information which is necessary to make some rational decision about what prices ought to be paid for the drugs which are being obtained and provided by way of pharmaceutical benefits to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instead, the Prime Minister would prefer to force more and more suffering on Australia than his Government has already imposed, and he maintains this farce while enjoying the suffering that he and he alone, through his stubbornness and deceit, is prepared to inflict upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, the amendment moved by  Senator Withers  and the speech of  Senator Withers  are intended to deceive the Australian electors, but the Opposition has not been successful in deceiving the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> up to date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been endorsed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its actions recently have won the applause and support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that one of the reasons for the great support that the Government has received in recent days has been a basic understanding by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the parliamentary system must survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was digging in the dirt and trying to find something which might indicate to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Government had failed to maintain a proper control over the administration of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition knows that the economy is now on the upturn and it is trying to deceive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into believing that it is time for the Liberal Party and National Country Party to take over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No evidence was found, and yet the Opposition is trying to convey to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, who are now backing off from the Opposition, that the Government is at fault. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only has he control of the Government, but in my opinion he and his Government also have the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister said that not a penny would go to  Mr Khemlani  and he was plotting to put the loan in higher interest rates so that over 20 years of compound interest the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The emphasis and the understanding of this present crisis have been placed quite improperly before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He seems again to be overlooking that it is the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who will alter the Australian Constitution and not an action from the Prime Minister who decides that he will change the powers and curb the powers of the Australian Senate as they exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has been singularly unable to do that by amendments to the Australian Constitution, which he repeatedly is placing before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I am concerned, the reason is that this Government has been a government which has abused the trust that has been given to it by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The breakdown of government has originated in the one act- I would be prepared to test this before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- of illegality which took place on 13 December last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is being unveiled to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> only by the act of the free Press in Australia which has used its processes to print the truth as it finds it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would like to have all of the truth but we have enough of the truth and enough recognition by government of the truth that this Government is no longer able to hold the trust which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> gave to it as a government to act in the interests of the whole of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The meeting, of the Executive Council on 13 December devised a process by which it could by-pass the Treasury and the Australian Parliament and by which it could mislead the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> so that the enormous sum of $4,000 m could be borrowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was also asked whether he sought the approval of the Loan Council, as he must constitutionally do if he requires sums to be borrowed on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are using the only mechanism available to the Australian Parliament to force this Government to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for their verdict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The breakdown that we are now seeing in the Parliament is the important and the last step in forcing a government because of its act of conspiracy to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for their verdict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the Government by-passed the Treasury, the Loan Council and the Parliament in these matters cannot be stressed too strenuously at this stage so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will understand that all of the checks and balances that do exist in the Australian Parliament have been ignored by the Government and the safeguards that should exist between government and people have not been preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What instructions would be given to officers of the Treasury and officers of other departments in terms of their responsibilities as members of the Australian Public Service to suggest that they should pay cheques or that they could negotiate payments in the name of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> without the Appropriation Bills as they exist in our parliamentary structure? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for this reason that we have no hesitation in saying to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that this Government has shown the dishonesty which requires it to face them for their verdict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are using the mechanism of the elected senators in this country to force this Government to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is timely that we use the Parliament to explain to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that their verdict is required on a government which, through its conspiracy, has lost the trust of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and which no longer has the right to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I deal instead with the responsibility of the Senate to use the only mechanism available to it to force a government, which has carried out the dishonest practices to which I have referred, to face the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we put that into balance with the fact that we cannot get information in the Parliament, and that we may somehow devise a system whereby we can license newspapers or the other means of mass communication, we reach a situation of very grave concern when we are talking about dealing with the financial responsibilities of government as they relate to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should allow the democratic process to take effect so that we can have a government elected which will have the confidence and trust of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In turn, that government will have an understanding that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should have better access to sound administrative processes than those that have been developed since December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have only to look at what happened outside this Parliament House on Thursday of last week when there was a demonstration by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who are concerned that the lifeblood of this country is in danger of being denied to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed the Government, having had the opportunity to continue, having been given what it asked for- namely, a fair go, a chance to do the things that it maintained it was capable of doing and determined to do on behalf of the total <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- has, 1 8 months later, as a result of its policies and as a result of its legislation, put the country in a considerably worse circumstance than it was in previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the rush to implement and to establish an ideological circumstance is in no way divorced from the problems, economic and social, that have continued to confound the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators opposite are democrats they will accept our challenge, grasp the nettle and go to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> whom they are supposed to represent and whom we are supposed to represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I similarly look forward with an equal amount of confidence to the decision of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as soon as they are given the opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have been sent to the House of Representatives with a clear indication that the Senate will pass those Bills when the House of Representatives, through its Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  presents itself to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are saying in effect, is that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have got a right to determine their future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That this Bill be not further proceeded with until the Government agrees to submit itself to the judgment of the people, the Senate being of the opinion that the Prime Minister and his Government no longer have the trust and confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because of- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore when  Sir Robert  speaks to me and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> I have a considerable respect for what he says. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To most <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> this country is a great deal more important than any single man, no matter how high his self-esteem and how high his vanity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that he has to come to account before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we seek to achieve is that he comes to be recorded before the bar of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at a proper time and on a proper occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we in the Opposition are doing is seeking to give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> properly and sensibly a chance to look at honourable senators opposite with clear eyes and to say, as I am sure they will, that they have had enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have guaranteed the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that their present position will be maintained and that we will safeguard their future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But on an issue of the magnitude of the one that confronts the Parliament at the present time we have had a genuinely independent point of view put forward, not only to this Parliament but also to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the matters that we are discussing tonight and which have been the subject of this long and sometimes tedious debate are matters which are quite basic to our Constitution, to our parliamentary system and to the rights of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if the great majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are a not prepared to accept the validity of the arguments of either the Labor Party, the Liberal Party or the National Country Party, at least they can listen with validity to the point of view that is being put by  Senator Bunton. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack does not want to hear these facts restated because these are facts which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want to know because they are being given by the Opposition generalised statements which are not substantiated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not the path that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want to see the Opposition follow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I close on this note: I am sure the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> realise just how much damage is being done to our parliamentary system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter what the politics in this particular debate and the decision that has been taken, one fact remains fundamentalthat any action taken by a political party in this country to bring down that parliamentary system will be rejected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leave out all words  s after ‘That’,  insert: these Bills be not further proceeded with until the Government agrees to submit itself to the judgment of the people, the Senate being of the opinion that the Prime Minister and his Government no longer have the trust and confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because of- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of these days it is going to have to face the real issues of its incompetence, its deceit, the future of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and its refusal as a government to face them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So some 75 per cent of the amounts provided in the Appropriation Bills which are before the Senate for consideration have the purpose of meeting the basic needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; that is funds provided by the Australian Government and by the States in the earmarking of funds from the Australian Government to the State instrumentalities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not take into account the economic difficulties that face all of the western countries but endeavour to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that there is something exceptional and something different as far as the Australian economy is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in these circumstances, when Bill after Bill in this House is being rejected again by the Senate, that we have to take this problem to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not surrender the support for the Government which they have elected twice in 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it has been proved in the debates both in the Parliament and outside the Parliament that the Budget alternatives which the Opposition parties have put forward do not constitute an alternative Budget or an alternative economic program for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir Isaac  Isaacs and other eminent constitutional lawyers have constantly placed before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the need to see the Senate as a House of review and not as a House bent to bring down the elected government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an indictment of the Opposition parties that they should use this stratagem at this point when in fact all the evidence points to a recovery in the economy and to the Australian Government being able properly to govern this country in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it is intended to denigrate  Mr Hawke  and also to cloud the issues that confront the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do not think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will fall for that sort of argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate was then criticising and castigating the Government for having set up a number of royal commissions to inquire into matters affecting the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, including the Royal Commission on Petroleum, but, that commission having presented its report to the Parliament on the subject matter into which it was inquiring, the Opposition has now come out and said: ‘We are not satisfied with that report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation, therefore, does not create a legislative framework in any abstract way but builds upon a substantial foundation- a foundation, I add, which has the support of 94 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> right across party lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not be deceived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That this Bill be not further proceeded with until the Government agrees to submit itself to the judgment of the people, the Senate being of the opinion that the Prime Minister and his Government no longer have the trust and confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because of- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Government will have some explaining to do to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in due course, when it presents itself to the people at a House of Representatives election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the information has emerged day by day, week by week, month by month, it has so heightened our concern that we have felt it is time the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were informed of these matters and given a chance to judge the financial capacity and general probity of the Government which we presently have in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The denial of supply has polarised the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and has brought the Australian Parliamentary system into contempt and ridicule both at home and abroad and, if continued, will cause undue hardship to many and cause chaos in significant sectors Qf industry and commerce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-0-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This sort of action, without any doubt, will just add to the destruction of confidence in this Government and its ability to handle the affairs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, I believe that we are seeing in Australia the progressive building up of what I might call a Dreyfus case, and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are beginning to say: ‘J ‘accuse’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Opposition has been taken completely by surprise by the feelings which have been expressed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about its unprecedented and immoral conduct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But today we- the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- are shareholders through our investment in companies such as Mareeba Mining No Liability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want continuing government interference in their lives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want an Australian community that is becoming increasingly and totally dependent upon government services? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want an Australian community that is able to express itself or has its expressions made for it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view the Treasurer has deliberately misled the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and this constitutes an affront to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order that this country can be administered efficiently and properly and in accordance with convention and standard practice, the Government is attempting today to have restored to the Senate notice paper Appropriation Bills that the Opposition continues, in defiance of the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, to have deferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it would get some respect from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> if it had the courage of its convictions and moved for the rejection of the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As members of the Opposition polarised and divided this great nation and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in respect of Vietnam when they were in office, so too are they now polarising the people and the Australian nation by their tearing up of the long established principles of democracy and the conventions which bring about stability and confidence within a nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What members of the Opposition have done and what they are doing now is to say to the Parliament and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that they refuse to consider the Budget unless it is on a condition imposed upon the Government by them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Opposition continues to adopt the attitude it has adopted it will continue to lose the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is they who are showing a callous indifference to the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The victims of that are the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the form of the challenge which has now been put up on this matter by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not in a great constitutional crisis in the sense that has been advocated and argued by Government senators or by Government supporters in another place, but we are in a crisis where the authority of the Parliament is being directly challenged by the Prime Minister who refuses to disclose to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the elements of corruption which involve him or some of his Ministers, whom he has acknowledged were involved in it in the last 12 months- since December 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is a totally devious man and he is no longer respected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The alternative put forward by the Leader of the Liberal Party is to try to cultivate a style of government that receives the respect of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, commands their attention and gives the Liberal Party the right to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real task is to persuade the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of that as a political exercise, quite apart from the constitutional problems which you have, quite apart from questions of political morality and quite apart from departure from the fine sounding statements which their new Leader of principle has espoused over the last few months and from which he has so consistently departed in practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government taken steps to indicate to the Portuguese and Indonesian governments and to the Apodeti and the UDT that the sustained support for Fretilin by communist and other extreme left wing organisations in Australia in no way reflects the viewpoint of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the country is concerned about and what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are concerned about is what is going to happen in the period ahead if the Opposition continues its present mad course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether the Opposition will come to its senses in the next few weeks remains to be seen, but obviously the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are wide awake to what the Opposition is up to and the damage it is doing to the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That fighting tom cat is to be found in the 70 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who were polled who have said to the Leader of the Opposition: ‘Pass Supply’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their benefits will soon be flowing to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the particular groups who need them- the low-income earners, the children, the sick, the handicapped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately for the Opposition, the mass of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> outside are stirred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, in keeping with a long history that seems to be part of our culture, will not bow down to jackboot-type leadership from  Mr Fraser  or  Mr Anthony. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sooner some of the more liberal members in  Mr Fraser’s  Party stand up to him and say: ‘This far, no further’, the sooner democracy will be allowed to go on and the Government to get down to the job, the economy to be brought back into its proper perspective and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to see the further results of Labor legislation flow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a feeling it is not because they want to help the lower income earners or the large mass of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet this Labor Government sitting opposite has the gall to say that nothing has happened for which it should be invited to stand trial before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody in Australia should see it as a defiance of the people, because in Australia as in America the Senate is elected on the full general adult franchise of all the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It goes to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and says to the 5 million electors: We are prepared to take your judgment in the ballot box. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government were to succumb to the pressures of the Opposition it would be presenting to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the third election in 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The arrogant grab for power which he set in motion only a fortnight ago has failed and is clearly now not enjoying any support from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have not been able to understand that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are interested in a fair go for a government, that they are interested in the democratic processes with which the Labor Party has been associated ever since it was formed in 1 89 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is good to see that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have rejected this opportunist move that  Mr Fraser  and his colleagues made only a fortnight ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is good to know that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are able to see through the manoeuvre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be hoped that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will appreciate that in this chamber it is not just the Australian Labor Party senators who are supporting this position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can assure the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that from our side of the chamber we will fight to retain this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will mobilise the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will win the minds and the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in this constitutional-cum-political crisis which has been engineered by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that they are matters of top priority for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure the honourable senator that the Australian Government will continue to govern under the mandate that it has been given by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> until such time as the normal general election comes around again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Mr Hayden,  the Treasurer, pointed out only yesterday, certain items of normal expenditure will not reach the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Government has consistently taken the view that all aspects of the National Estate must be protected from the pillaging of those who seek personal benefit from the cultural heritage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the sooner they get around to being sensible again themselves the better it will be for their Party and for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason it is hellbent on destroying the Government which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> elected by overwhelming majorities in 1 972 and 1 974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have an answer to this- a reasonable answer and an answer which is accepted by an overwhelming majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if the Opposition were in government whatever it did would be unpalatable to many <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the proposed national rehabilitation and compensation scheme is the most proper and suitable means of overcoming the ever-increasing difficulties of insurers throughout Australia in both of these fields, which are of vital importance to all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not been able to pursue many of the programs on which we were elected and for which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> voted for us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those efforts reached their culmination last year when the Opposition forced a double dissolution of both Houses of the Australian Parliament which resulted in a repudiation by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the tactics which the Liberal and Country Parties followed and the return of this Government to office for a second time within 1 8 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the gallup polls which are published in the Sydney  Bulletin,  which seem notoriously to show a certain bias, whether intentional or otherwise, against the Australian Labor Party, indicate that the percentage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who are supporting this Government is galloping ahead while the percentage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who support the defunct parties which sit opposite us is falling like the leaves of autumn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  having achieved that high office only recently, now has the approval of only 29 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have declined because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> realise that so enthusiastic, so neglectful, and so insensitive is the Opposition to the feelings of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the democratically expressed will of the overwhelming majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it is prepared to come at anything in order to get back on to the Treasury bench. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition, through its irresponsible actions and through its lunatic actions which have been repudiated by an increasing number of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and by an overwhelming majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, is grasping at any excuse in order to seize government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, Opposition members have shown to all of us as they have shown to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what a bankrupt collection of mountebanks they are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have repudiated them in the same way as they repudiated them last year when they forced this country to a double dissolution and in the same way as ultimately they will repudiate them when in good time, in accordance with proper constitutional conventions, this Government does go to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then they will see just what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> think of those who would be prepared to prostitute Parliament by presenting this piffle as an excuse for not allowing a democratically elected government to carry out the business of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would not be a solution that would satisfy the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because the crisis surely must be relevant to the Government’s performance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all these views there is a strong consensus that the sort of power that is being used by the Senate today is a proper and responsible power to use on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have confidence in a government which has shown the sort of internal instability of personnel that has been the history of this Government, including 3  Deputy  Prime Ministers in 3 years and the sacking of 2 Acting Prime Ministers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These matters have become totally and clearly evident in the last 3 years and they are the concern of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These sorts of things, plus the problems of inflation and unemploymen t, plus the problems of increasing industrial unrest and the internal and external instability through which this country is becoming a piece of flotsam and jetsam, joined in some sort of poetic way to some imaginary third world- these are the circumstances that have caused a responsible Opposition to take responsible action on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is essential in the interests of the Australian public to understand precisely what has happened since the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> elected the Labor Government in December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> elected the Labor Government on 2 December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words,  Mr Fraser  now recognises that he has compromised himself and his colleagues and is attempting by his offer to compromise this Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the immediate issues upon which a vote will be taken, but underlying those issues is the fundamental question of whether the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> shall have the right to vote out this incompetent, corrupt and bad Government; or shall we for a period indefinitely into the future have to suffer a government on the apparent belief that there is no means of bringing its tenure of office to an end? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the Government has been cavilling at its apparent rejection by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We did so on the basis of a mandate- an authority that was given to us by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have instituted new policies which are now overwhelmingly accepted by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to him that the only thing which has caused the fall in the fortunes of this Government in the past few months has been the corrupt campaign of the Opposition to deceive the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about what this Government has been doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is quite evident that a very significant percentage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can see now the dire consequences of what the Opposition is doing to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could see that, the day the Opposition decided not to pass the Appropriation Bills and, with the mandate to continue in government which was given to us last year by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> we legitimately set about finding ways and means whereby we could continue to finance the operations of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But an election fought on this fundamental issue is one which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the issue on which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would decide an election, I believe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are concerned about is ensuring the minimum disruption to the Australian economy, the minimum hardship to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer has not brought to the notice of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the fact that $2,6 1 1 m more will be collected from the tax paying public in this current year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A very large burden of cost, apart from the suffering which the Opposition has already inflicted on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, will have to be met by way of payments by the Australian taxpayers for many years to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are looking to it for a more responsible attitude towards the affairs of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leave out all words after ‘That ‘, insert- these Bills be not further proceeded with until the Government agrees to submit itself to the judgment of the people, the Senate being of the opinion that the Prime Minister and his Government no longer have the trust and confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because of- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I wish to observe to my colleagues in the Senate that the reason why the Opposition has taken its position is because of the incompetence of the Government, the economic mess that it has created, the unemployment that it has brought about, the inflation that it has engendered and the state of lack of confidence and disaster in which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> find themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The time has come for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to judge the Government, its record and its ability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the Opposition, in not opposing these Bills, at least is recognising its own limitations of the past and the fact that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want the Australian Government to become more financially involved in providing public services for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I challenge the Opposition to the view that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not want Australian Government funding to go in larger sums to the State and local governments but they do want larger sums of Commonwealth funding to go to the areas of education and public works in the total sense as well as to the improvement of the welfare programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It needs to be emphasised time and time again that the very simple solutions that the Opposition puts to the Senate and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have very little substance in fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I add my voice to an appeal to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to be associated with these people in raising money for humanitarian purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751111_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That does not mean, of course, that we will not be fighting at every opportunity to expose the Government’s errors, to expose errors which we believe have occurred in the past and about which we will continue to remind the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760217_senate_30_s67/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will realise in future how important it is for us to have good diplomatic relations with these people as human beings on the march forward to a great future after the liberation of their nation from the domination and surveillance that it has suffered over the centuries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760217_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can the Government expect the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to believe that statement in view of a whole series of cuts in expenditure- some of which have been announced and others not announced- which include the abolition of pensioner funeral benefits, increases in pharmaceutical benefits charges and attempts to frustrate wage indexation, to name a few, while at the same time investment allowances are introduced that will be of the greatest benefit to large businesses and at the expense of small businesses? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister whether a statement could be prepared as soon as possible to be given to the Parliament and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> so that in this field, which is of so much interest to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, we shall all be well aware of what the Government intends to do and we shall be able to debate whatever propositions it has to put forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Public Service is a highly efficient and capable organisation which serves the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with great integrity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to say in respect of that matter only that the Australian Labor Party accepts the decision of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not accept the manner in which the election was brought about and it will continue to explain to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the wrongness of what was done and the inherent dangers which those actions have brought to the Australian parliamentary system, in the hope that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will recognise that there must be constitutional changes in this country which would prevent any political party ever again bringing about the event that we saw last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the very first acts of this Government was to sell out the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s interests through the Australian Atomic Energy Commission in the Ranger project and to sell out our interests in Mary Kathleen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these standards are not maintained the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> certainly will be made aware of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I support the remarks made today by the Leader of the Opposition,  Senator Wriedt,  who said that the Labor movement accepts the verdict passed upon it by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on 13 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the day on which the Australian nation, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian Parliament witnessed what I hope was the most violent political convulsion that this nation will ever see. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had deferred consideration of Supply and we all know that at least one of its then members had stated publicly to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that if the Opposition moved to reject Supply he would vote against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great tragedy about all of this- I mention this particularly because we are addressing our remarks this evening to the words of the Governor-General when he delivered his Speech from this chamber yesterdayis that a very large number of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who always have believed so fervently in the principle of the election of members to the Parliament are very rapidly losing faith in the system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  mention this to let members of the media know that there are strong feelings amongst many hundreds of thousands, indeed millions, of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- at least 43 per cent of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Senator Willesee  was here he repeatedly gave us the story of how we performed at the United Nations in relation to many sections of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of foreign origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that in the near future in the peace talks that will take place the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and their Parliament will give as much service to the cause of the Cypriots as has been given by senior United States Democrats such as  Senator Egerton. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been ruled upon by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> clearly and absolutely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What could there be sinister for democracy in a circumstance in the operation of a constitution, which saw the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> given the opportunity to go thoughtfully, responsibly and quietly to cast their vote in secret ballot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While that remains the province of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> I believe that democracy in this country is secure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it was realised that that was under challenge the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> made a very clear decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose my Government has set itself is not merely to give Australia prosperity, predictability and stability- important though those things obviously are- it is also to develop in a rational and sensible fashion a new and exciting role for government- one which places more reliance on the commonsense and reason of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the servant of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greater the involvement of the public sector, the greater will be the burden of taxation on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; and that has to be assessed, regulated and reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been getting from the media operations in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who should feel outraged at what they are not being told by the media. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who should revolt at what they are not being told. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it will take a simple 3 years for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to realise that they have been conned by this Liberal-National Country Party coalition Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am talking about what is being done to us, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in 3 years the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will see through the facade of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we lived under a socialist government that had no cares and no thoughts about the dignity or the lives of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a period of nearly a quarter of a century when the wishes, the desires, the hopes and the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were completely ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want to live a life of their own choosing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that this Government will direct its financial resources and its mental resources in the right direction for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the GovernorGeneral is a man who it must be acknowledged by most thinking people- and the Australian electorate seemed to think so- had to take a decision on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, however difficult it must have been for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think it has to be said that those events have polarised this country, that it will remain polarised and that the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Labor movement and progressive public opinion will not rest until such time as the real issues that were involved in the conspiracy of 1 975 are laid bare before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The regrettable feature is that I believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> did not understand the issues, just as they would not have understood them if they had been in the United States at the time of the start of the Watergate inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that just because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> gave an endorsement, that does not make the position right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one listens to the speeches of honourable senators opposite, one realises how much they fail to understand the psychology of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as indeed they fail to understand the philosophy of the Labor movement itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite laugh, and that indicates how they fail to understand the psychology of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opposition senators have been cajoled by  Senator Rae,  admonished by  Senator Missen,  threatened by  Senator Sheil,  lectured by  Senator Baume  and traduced by  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack to give up the desire to try to rectify the wrong and to explain to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we have this man,  Mr Fraser,  who was part of this whole sordid and sorry deal of last year, now attempting to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that our taxation in respect of our gross domestic product is out of relationship and, in fact, that is what is creating the economic difficulties in our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a very fine Prime Minister we have in a man who tells the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> via the Liberal Party s secretariat that it was in fact from an official document and then says that it was from a Treasury document and finally has to admit to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that he lied! <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can gain respect and dignity in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> only if it is seen to be an institution which behaves itself and operates according to certain defined rules- which I thought until last year were accepted by all political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I fear that the direction in which change will be managed is the direction which is suggested in point 4 on page 2 of the Governor-General’s Speech, that is, to go back to a situation of abdication of national responsibility as a government and to return those responsibilities to State governments which, I believe, have neither the capacity, the imagination nor indeed the necessary structures to carry out the task in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I do not agree with the political philosophy of many of those who have spoken and I will not agree with the political philosophy of some of those who are still to speak, I hope that this will not prevent us from working together for the betterment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that we as an <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> recognise this and accept the responsibility that it places upon us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, is the Attorney-General aware that his action is viewed by <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as one of the most blatant, arrogant and neo-Gestapo acts of aggression against civil rights since the days of Hitler’s Germany and that the precedent now established should not be repeated? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would find it very difficult to accept the proposition that a Labor member of Parliament is 3 times as good as a Liberal or National Country Party member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, that may be a new reason why the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> elected a Parliament with only about one-third its members being members of the honourable senator’s Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to reflect on the fact that in 1949 it was the American State Department that suggested to the Australian Government that there was a need to establish an intelligence organisation in Australia that would be able to have passed to it information which would be of value from the American point of view and in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, I think the principle should be established firmly that the security organisation should remain a servant of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and of the Parliament and not just of the government of the particular day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one examined the evidence presented to  Senator Church’s  inquiry in the United States and if one examined the files of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation one would find reams and reams of paper expressing points of view about the activities of decent <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who wished only to express their views about a particular political situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because ASIO indulged in activities which lowered the standing of the intelligence service in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, particularly in the eyes of those Australians who care very much about democracy and the rights of the individual, that an investigation and reform of <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am hopeful that the results of the royal commission into ASIO will provide us with more clues as to how to establish a better security service in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the narrow view that what is good for the Western District graziers and the Jaycees is necessarily good for Australia, this Government surely will find to its cost that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> emphatically do not share those assumptions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not matter how an election results; the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a consistent view that government is a creative force designed to serve their interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Historically, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want those services increased and they want them improved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assurances which were given to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> during the election campaign of November-December 1975 on the future of wage indexation have now been revealed for what they always were- shabby lies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be sure, if the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have made one point abundantly clear to governments over the last decade, it is that they wish their opinions to be considered, their aspirations to be acknowledged and their demands to be met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the conservatives’ past record of implacable opposition to such reform is any indication, and there is no reason to suggest that it is not, then the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should anticipate a perpetuation of the present system of unfair electoral boundaries, and redistributions based on those boundaries, solely designed to entrench the Liberal-National Country Party coalition in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore there will be no democratic test by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for at least 5Vi years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No simple reasons are apparent to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter to which I shall refer is allied to the action of the Governor-General, the facts concerning which are unknown to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not against change in the system as long as it does not destroy that concept and as long as it does not delude the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into thinking that they will pay less tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be inappropriate to the remarkable occasion of the dissolution, its constitutional significance and the signal victory that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> registered for the maintenance of proper constitutional procedures and for the restoration to government of a government of responsibility not to deal with that matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure honourable senators opposite that the members of the Parliamentary Labor Party and the Party’s organisation outside are determined to remind the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> continually of what took place and to show to what murky depths the Liberal Party sank in order to remove the elected Labor Government from office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Public Service is a highly efficient and capable organisation which serves the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with great integrity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The word carries with it the suggestion that legislation of this Parliament should be for the good of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, of course, it was just another case of humbugging the Parliament and humbugging the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interests of the Parliament and of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> I ask the Minister: Will he tell the Senate when the Treasurer is going to make a major economic statement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concern and the queries were adequately backed up by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when the events finally occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How free are the people of this country when we remember how we were forced out of office in November last year after the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at a free election had elected a government for a term of 3 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the thing that has been used to mislead the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> time and again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as time went by and as the massive spending of government funds was evident, however apparently attractive that seemed, a great deal of concern was caused to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This may be obvious to us all but I am quite sure that for the last 3 years the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were lulled into some acceptance of the fact that there was absolutely no limit to the distribution of funds and of financial resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the servant of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to this Bill in order to refer to a matter of concern to a great number of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since that time, the Australian Parliament, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and particularly the people of New South Wales have not received one word of advice or one recommendation from the Government flowing from the recommendations in the IAC’s report on the dairy industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst those recommendations are in abeyance- the IAC reported on the dairy industry after considering the matter for21/2 years- and because of the indolence of the present Federal Government in failing to announce any recommendations to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> arising from the report of the IAC into the dairy industry, the New South Wales Government has decided to hold an inquiry into the state of the dairy industry in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one can assert that  Mr Lashwood  did not do a job of service for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is a man who has given outstanding service to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to the entertainment industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will be aware that during the Address-in-Reply debate I brought to the attention of the Senate, and hence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, a matter which has concerned me and many other Queensland people for some considerable time; that is, the Aurukun Associates Agreement Bill which was introduced by the Queensland Government some time ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that in the case of the pharmaceutical companies the Government will yet see the error of its way in selling out the Fawnmac group of companies and will decide that it will be of great benefit to the Government and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have an interest in a drug company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already its progress reports have produced very great results for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a time when we have more than enough economic and social problems to keep us fully occupied, it may seem untimely to ask the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to give some thought to longer term population goals and growth rates including the desirable size and composition of our population at various stages up to the end of this century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This applies both to policies involving government services to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, such as education or social welfare, and to policies in which population is treated as a resource, such as the gearing of manpower to economic development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I attempt to deal with some of the arguments purporting to support such a merger or purporting to support other would-be reforms such as the introduction of commercial advertising into ABC programs, I ask honourable senators to consider what it is that the ABC does for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the Minister when introducing the Bill to suggest that there is some upturn in private sector housing and that, therefore, this will provide opportunities for the great bulk of the Australian population, indicates that he does not understand that, because of the prevailing economic conditions, at least half of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> need to have their accommodation provided for them by public housing instrumentalities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The desires of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are changing also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any reference that has been made to the forthcoming Budget as a Budget that will be tough for the Government in terms of government spending but not tough for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in terms of the burden of taxation is something which will be welcomed at this stage by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The actions of this Government will show, as they did in the past, that it has lost touch with the real basic needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is felt, by any people whose basic motivations are to give a cultural gloss to what is essentially a rather sordid trade relationship, that by establishing this Foundation we can really help to interest <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in a significant way or Japanese people in a significant way in the respective cultures of the 2 countries, we make a very grave mistake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Government will look seriously at this situation and make it possible for more people to tour inside Australia and for more <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to tour in the territory of our nearest trading neighbours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The strength is not always as the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are accustomed to it being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The primary purpose of the visit will be to celebrate the silver jubilee of Her Majesty’s accession to the Throne and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be pleased to know that the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will be able to visit each State- even though their time in each will be limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member said that subsidies for phosphate were consumer subsidies which enabled the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have access to cheaper foodstuffs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for National Resources: Is he aware that the  Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister for National Resources misled the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian Parliament when he announced recently that other countries would take, by force, the uranium they required from north Australian deposits unless Australia negotiated contracts to sell massive quantities of uranium to Japan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He indicated to us that he was sympathetic to the independence movement, that he had no time for Indonesia and that we should use every endeavour possible when we returned to Australia to alert the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the possibilities of an invasion by Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then lends himself to a story about atrocities and seeks to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the provisional government which now has temporary control of Indonesia ought to be supported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet there has never been a satisfactory answer given to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> or to this Parliament, by either the last Government or this Government, about what happened to those Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They asked me to come back to Australia and tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of their feelings and what they expected Australia to do in relation to the problems that they were facing at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On my return to Australia I endeavoured to communicate with the then Prime Minister to convey to him the feelings of the people of East Timor and to inform him what they were seeking from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They said to me: ‘We would ask you, Neville, to go back to Australia and tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the turmoil that is going on in East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And we would ask you to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that we need this kind of assistance.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said: ‘Well, look, if I could go back to Australia and convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that you needed this kind of assistance and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> agreed and were prepared to give this kind of assistance, how can we, as Australians, be convinced that you will give this kind of aid to all the people of East Timor?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You send it up and send <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> here whether they be Red Cross or some non-political organisation and come and distribute this humanitarian aid yourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But you send <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and distribute the humanitarian aid impartially throughout East Timor. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They said: ‘Look, Neville, on top of that, send a team of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not care whether they are members of Parliament, whether they are members of a church organisation, whether they are members of a charitable organisation or whoever they might be; send them up here to look at the whole thing themselves and ascertain the situation for the peace of mind or whatever of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> so that there will be impartial observation of what is happening in East Timor.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They wanted <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to go to East Timor, to observe and to talk to all the East Timorese people to ascertain for Australia the true situation in East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we could not stir the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the Australian Government or the Australian Opposition into listening to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An indication of the present Government’s vehement dislike for anything owned and operated by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is afforded by the remarks of an honourable gentleman in the other place who represents the Federal division of Swan when he was speaking in the debate on these Bills in the lower House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are subsidising ATI whilst it continues to maintain very large profits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said quite clearly and distinctly to the islanders and to the whole community that if the problems of Cocos Islands are to be solved they are going to be solved by co-operation between all groups interested in this matter, be it the estate, the administration, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> working on West Island or the community itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a recognised need to inform this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> how moneys granted for education purposes are spent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think I need to say a great deal more than that, except perhaps once again to reiterate that at a time like this we ought to be very conscious of the debt incurred by governments on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> being raised totally, being examined by the Loan Council, always being consolidated, and being properly and regularly paid off to those who have lent the money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to know where are the instant and automatic increases in pensions, because the impression that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> gained was that if the Liberal and National Country parties came to power there would be instant and automatic increases in pensions whenever there was an increase in the cost of living index. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we have been quite frank in saying to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that in view of the present economic circumstances we are unable to consider this question as a matter of priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> put forward as a first suggestion the idea of abolishing the funeral benefit, a scheme which has to be administered, and simply paying the pension for an additional week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why this statement has been made about the continuation of that benefit for a period of 12 weeks is to enable the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and those other people who are concerned to understand that it is not one week that is given as a gesture but it is 12 weeks that has been given as a gesture thus enabling the readjustment of expenditure in the case of married persons to be undertaken without undue hardship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one adds this action to the withdrawal of many other services by the present Government from the people, one begins to realise the massive number of services which have been withdrawn and to which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the Whitlam Labor Government doubled the take on sales tax, doubled the take on customs duties, forced the States into putting up their indirect taxes and charges and, in fact, by any calculation made the tax impost on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by far the heaviest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that one way or the other either the formula has gone awry, that no one in fact knows just what it is all about- I rather suspect that that is the case- or, worse still, that those in positions of government are attempting to hoodwink the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So there is a measure of responsibility, and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have indicated their recognition of that responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then, of course, following  Senator Townley  we heard from  Senator Baume,  the zealot, who was protecting the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an area in which decisions have to be made which will affect considerably the living standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has talked about making more money available to the States and, according to his several pronouncements, he is going to put more into the pay packet, the hip pocket, of the average wage earner and at the same time maintain the services which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have demanded recognition and which they think ought to be provided in the public sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are correct in asserting that in fact more taxation will be paid by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister’s answer is ‘no ‘, will he give an assurance to the Senate that the Government intends to proceed with those policies- particularly in the States of Western Australia and Tasmania- with the consequent imposition of a double taxation system on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> voted for the Government and they voted for this part of its policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am disturbed, as I hope the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be disturbed, at the attitude that has been taken by the Department of Foreign Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that somebody has to be called to explain to us and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> why it is that we were kept uninformed, that information was kept from the Australian Parliament, because members of all political parties asked questions in the House of Representatives and in the Senate last year and this year about the death of the Australian journalists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the present Foreign Minister  (Mr Peacock),  in speeches made in Jakarta during his recent visit, has shown on the face of it every sign of trying to indicate very strongly to Indonesia his view that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not have any favourable view of what has happened in East Timor following military intervention by Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am quite sure that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be eager to see and to hear interviews with a man such as Solzhenitsyn who must be one of the most courageous men of massive integrity alive in the world today and also one of the great fighters for freedom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I see the debate in the Parliament as only the beginning of a debate which must take place throughout the nation- a debate something akin to the debate about Vietnamand in which all sections of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, particularly those who have a social conscience, will begin to understand the vagaries and difficulties that go with government policies and government legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no doubt that the economic package which is placed before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a panacea or a complete answer will be proved to be nothing other than a damp squib. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On Monday of last week the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  sought to highlight some aspects of a statement upon which he said the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should accept his interpretation of the economic path to be followed in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was when he gave his famous message that the Budget and the financial plans he had ahead would not be hard on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, they would be hard only on the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I have said in this chamber before, when the Labor Government came to power in 1972, if it had a mandate to do anything about which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> knew it had a mandate to introduce Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of it for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be confusion, a 2- tiered health system and the cost of implementation of the levy will be very considerable and confusing indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Fraser  is going back on the obligation which he undertook to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in December last year that he would not interfere with Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we say that we have an obligation to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to point out some of the thoughtless considerations in our view, some of the naive considerations and some of the purely rather bitchy ideological hangups which have motivated the Government in certain areas of the expenditure cuts which have been imposed upon the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe further in the course of action taken by the Government in seeking to provide freedom of choice for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> between the private health institutions or Medibank, or some sort of balance between the two. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a system which will breed confusion and fear in the minds of all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and it will replace a system which the members of the Parties that constitute the present Government undertook during the election campaign in December of last year they would not interfere with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Probably next in importance to, and sometimes I think equal to, the provision of hospital and medical care for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is legal aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has used arguments to justify this destruction which themselves are internally inconsistent and which they have not been able to explain either to the satisfaction of this Parliament or to the satisfaction of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that context once inflation is brought within bounds there will be an improvement in employment, a greater opportunity for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and a genuine rise in their living standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that it is ready for introduction and I feel sure that all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will welcome it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that they are engaging in something which we ought to be encouraging because it is part of the life and activity of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All they are asking the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to do is to give them the necessary backing for just a few years to enable them to prove that their faith is justified and that the apple industry will become viable and an asset to our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an area of malpractice to which surely, in the interests of the whole <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, some sort of real solution must be found, and it must be found in the very near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we see is a totality of charges and concessions which will not be of any real benefit to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I am trying to make is that in this type of matter perhaps we could go about illustrating to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a little more seriously where their money is being spent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister quite seriously to consider those points so that the actions of this Parliament in terms of the spending of sums of money like that do not become a meaningless exercise but that that expenditure becomes a reality for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue with which we are concerned is that the Government is working in the mistaken belief that it is the deposit gap which is denying home ownership to the majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have sought to give back to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> some of the things they have lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have the choice of going to the Health Insurance Commission if they so wish or of going to the funds if they so wish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, what is happening is that certain of the radical unions are just attaching themselves to a slogan for their own purposes which have nothing to do with Medibank and which have nothing to do with the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we claimed at the time of introducing Medibank, this is because the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not stupid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From statements that the Government has made, it appears that the Government hopes that its new proposals will force 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> out of Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s decision to force half the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> back into private health funds can only be interpreted as breaking, in the most blatant manner, the Liberal-Country Party’s assurance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in November and December 1975 that Medibank would be retained and strengthened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than applying this shock treatment to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, business, industry and commerce, the Government would be well advised to subject itself to this shock treatment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be given for the first time a real choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is still waffling away about this alleged freedom of choice which the Liberal Party proposes to offer the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in relation to their health insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that it was the Nimmo Committee which talked about the private health funds in these terms: That they were inefficient; that they were undemocratic insofar as their members were concerned; that they offered no genuine freedom of choice to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; that there were too many competing funds, and that they were wasteful for that very reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second is that freedom of choice, if it exists, is being offered to the private health funds, and the Nimmo Committee so eloquently expressed the capacity which the funds had to offer that freedom of choice to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are very fearful of the confusion which would be caused to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the hidden costs which will be involved in dismantling or dismembering Medibank in the way in which it has been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for this reason that a very high proportion of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, despite the Medibank scheme, has chosen to be partially insured for those other aspects of care which they required to give them security of health care when they needed it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mention has been made from time to time throughout the day that confusion exists in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with regard to the alternative schemes and the new Medibank proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be convinced that they should have one form of health cover or another unless they are convinced that it is the one which best suits them and their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do question whether in actual fact it will provide an advantage to the great mass of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> whom  Senator Baume  sees it assisting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am querying whether the additional cash that will go into the pockets of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will compensate parents for the myriad other actions which the Government proposes to take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not accept that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are ready for such a plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that as the Government proceeds with its education program on Medibank between now and 1 October there will be no doubt in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as to what decisions are available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because ofthe acts and refusal of the Opposition, of which he was a member, to accept the 2 decisions of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in 1972 and 1974 and because of its undermining of public confidence in the Government and not allowing it to run its proper course as part of the electoral processes in this country, surely the Prime Minister was entitled to some understanding of the position that he took. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By the tacit acceptance by the Australian Government, past and present, of the events that have taken place in Timor- the great tragedy is that this has not filtered through to the Parliament and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- in fact we have strengthened the hand of the extremist groups in Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have thought that every honourable senator in this chamber would want to have the fullest co-operation between the Government and the ACTU and to have the Government at all times take whatever steps can be taken to help in bringing about what could be of massive benefit to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, if indeed the Government and the trade union movement Budget come to some fair understanding on the real problems involved, including containing inflation and restoring full employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The scandal and outrage that the Opposition and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> feel about the highhanded activities of the Government will be expressed over the next 3 years and most forcefully and finally in December 1978, or before then if an election is held before that date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The simple fact is that, whilst Ministers can come in here, briefed by Treasury officers, and rattle off statistics, recite percentages and talk in economic jargon, unemployment is a very serious matter for hundreds of thousands of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who previously were in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, the areas in which government expenditure has been cut back to finance this very costly and ineffective investment allowance are the specific purpose grants to the States, which have a very high employment generating potential, the direct capital expenditure on public works by the Federal Government, which likewise has a very high employment generating potential, and such other fields as Aboriginal affairs, which  Senator Bonner  was quite vocal about yesterday, noting that both the present Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  and the previous caretaker Minister had repudiated the undertakings that they gave to the Aboriginal community and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole not to cut expenditure on Aboriginal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760819_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the statement made by the Prime Minister that unionists were principally involved, will the Minister seek confirmation of the remarks of the Commonwealth Police officer to substantiate the report, or are we entitled to draw the conclusion that the Prime Minister has misled the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Prime Minister’s statement is just another example of union bashing by some members of this Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that the answer from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> came through very clearly and very strongly in December 1975 when they threw out the socialist experiment of previous years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the ballot box has proved to be a futility, as it did late in I97S, and when a political party seizes power by violating conventions and by lies and misrepresentations, and when it arrogantly and blatantly breaks its election promises, which is what the Liberal and Country parties did in respect of Medibank, the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, particularly the working class people in Australia, have every right to use the methods of passive resistance - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-I think that the people of Tasmania and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole would regard it as bordering on criminal negligence- they were the words I used- if a State Government which had the funds to engender employment and to create job opportunities in the State nevertheless did not use those funds and allowed the highest unemployment in Australia to occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has already shown that he is fully aware that at the turn of the century the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were seriously divided on the contentious issue of free trade and protection and that Australia’s tariff policy over the intervening years has been to encourage the setting up of Australian industries, particularly textile industries, with tariff protection sufficient to counter the cheap labour cost advantages of countries- particularly Asian countries- where hours of work and terms and conditions of employment leave much to be desired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose the principal method is to rely upon the good sense and wisdom of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> which was demonstrated last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as private insurance is concerned, we would be wanting to see it put before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that Medibank private insurance is able to compete with private health funds for many of the services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said, this was done contrary to promises that were given and was done as pan of a general program of undermining health services for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I merely wish to say that the attack on the ABC- I must confess if one were to attack the ABC one could not pick a better mark than  Alvin Purple- is  part of an attack on something which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have become used to, that is, that the Commonwealth, through a statutory corporation, the Australian Broadcasting Commission, should be providing to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> entertainment and education of a type which they could not expect to obtain from commercial radio and television stations which operate only on the basis of making profits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is much more serious than the immediate economic consequences of the cuts in public expenditure is the dismay, the disenchantment, the disgust which they have caused amongst great masses of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is because of the total inadequacy of the private enterprise insurance system to meet the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By this Government acerbating class distinctions in this country, returning to the Coolidge-Hoover policies and the outmoded, outdated and eminently unsuccessful Adam Smith policies, and turning to the policies of Milton Friedman, which clearly do not work even in Chile where they have a military junta backing them up, the economic system of this country will fail, there will be dire poverty amongst substantial sections of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and even more irreparable damage will be done to the already badly damaged democratic system of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has publicly expressed, on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, his sympathy for their loss and was first to sign the book of condolence in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that it is necessary for the Opposition to bring home to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, at every opportunity and to the maximum of its ability, the dangers that lie ahead if this Government continues to pursue the policies which it has initiated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I trust that the Government will recognise that the fact that it is wedded to a particular philosophy does not mean that that philosophy is what the Australian economy needs or the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This attitude, no doubt, is supported by the left wing element of the trade union movement which, of course, has a vested interest in disruption in this country because when it tries to inflict its philosophy and attitudes on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, then of course we will be subject to disruptions in industry and unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In respect of capital expenditure in 1975-76 on buildings and the provision of services of a permanent nature for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the deficit under Labor’s Budget was $2 19m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government has a policy in regard to what it intends to do in these fields, I think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ought to know about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Australian Broadcasting Commission’s brief history since 1 932 it has built up a high reputation for providing a comprehensive range of services to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- services in education, the arts, music, drama, current affairs and news. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator James McClelland has reminded me about that statutory body, the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, which for 3 long and terrifying years for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> used its scissors every day and snipped out segments under the supervision and with the approval of the Whitlam Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under our scheme I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally will be far better off than they have been for a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that their real meaning was the understanding that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had of our scheme and what the caretaker Prime Minister, as he then was, on 27 November promised to maintain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I have pointed out, first of all it will create confusion in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is for this reason that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are completely confused and bewildered as to whether they must pay the levy, how much they must pay and other details associated with the proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Australia, what enormous reserves of capital they have accrued, even if each makes only half that profit, by misleading the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in 1975 into believing that Medibank would fail and that they must maintain their membership of private funds as doctors would not treat patients unless they were in the private funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reason why the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were told it was in their best interests to remain in the private funds is obvious now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether the Labor Party regards that as a statement of an intellectual, or would the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> regard it as morally insulting to boy scouts? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is especially important for the Australian Press and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have a clear sense of the basic approach and philosophy of the Opposition Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So the State Government of Tasmania does not deserve this type of denigration in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that has been put forward this afternoon by people who wish to score a few political points in speaking against the proposals that have been put forward by the Premier of Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we develop a practice in the Senate of scrutinising such Bills item by item to ensure that departments do not enter upon construction costs to the tune of $115,000 against the recommendations of feasibility studies, we will be discharging a duty which we are here to discharge- that is to say, exercise responsibility in relation to the money that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> provide by way of taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course the honourable  senator  set out to try to convince the people of Australia and his colleagues that they were justified in taking the course of action that they took because they believed, or so they said- I am sure they did not believe it, although they tried to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> they believed it- that Government expenditure at that time was of such moment, of such magnitude, that if the Senate passed Appropriation Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They have the gall and the temerity to stand here and criticise a government which was properly elected, which had to face 3 elections in 3 years and which had to face obstinacy and obstruction by the conservatives who never accepted the view of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when it was made clear on 2 separate occasions and who then used every trick in the political book to bring about the defeat of a properly and constitutionally elected government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every so often on a public platform they plead with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to buy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we examine whether the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are taking very much notice of the Government’s advice and we look at what is happening in respect of retail sales- that is part of the economic strategy- we find that public expenditure is more this year than it was last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other arm of criticism that was levelled at the Labor Government was that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> lacked confidence, that they would not spend in the market place and that they were putting their money into the savings banks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The issue was decided on 11 November and agreed to by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on 13 December 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I referred particularly to the $100m collection at the Australian War Memorial and to the fact that the Acting Director of the National Gallery had indicated that the collection which the Gallery holds on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is already valued at $30m to $40m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, in respect of the Tarcoola-Alice Springs connection I have no doubt that apart from the Territory people and the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Department of Transport, our defence people are very mindful of the necessity of making sure that the connection is established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My understanding is that there is no evidence that any substantial numbers of South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want to go to Monarto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> vote for the Labor Party members and then the members of caucus vote for their leader and for their shadow Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to that policy the Opposition makes 3 charges: Firstly, that this Government is the most centralist government in Australian history; secondly, that no federal government has such a consistent record of misleading the States; and thirdly, that the federalism policy is fundamentally unsound and will work to the disadvantage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only has the Government acted in a highly centralist and deceptive manner, it has also forced on the States a policy which will work to the detriment of all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until such time as the Commonwealth perhaps makes that breakthrough with one of the States the chance of this federalism policy bringing any benefits to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is extremely remote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us look at some of his achievements while working for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the Australian nation and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would suffer greatly if such a course were to be adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, the LiberalCountry Party Government long ago grasped the nettle of Australian education, the need for greater funding, the need for better standards and the need for greater availability of education to the widest possible range of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But looking beyond our personal expectations, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> themselves require skilled tradesmen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That leads me to the conclusion that the Government does not accept the authenticity of the messages, and that therefore they ought to be terminated and not conveyed to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I cannot understand how one of these gentlemen could possibly be construed to represent any threat to Indonesia or Australia and why he should be denied an opportunity to come to Australia and talk to the Government, members of the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They come from courageous people whose liberty, as well as that of their friends, could be in jeopardy if we were to reveal to the Senate and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the source of this information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly, I believe that the Indonesians, hearing people like  Senator Gietzelt  take the running, believe that there is not a genuine feeling for the East Timorese among the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Government has a responsibility on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, even on my behalf, again to approach the Indonesians in an attempt to have them allow the International Red Cross into East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the first responsibility is to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and not necessarily to the airline operators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to make a short intervention into the debate because I believe that the manner in which the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Amendment Bill has been introduced into the Senate, although it is not a matter which is likely to arouse great debate in the community at large, gives a very clear indication of this Government’s approach to the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I felt rather that it was the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who had the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rely on the sanity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the new Government was elected in December 1972 it was obvious that this was part of the policy for which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> decided to change the administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation is just another example of the trend of the Government to exclude the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from participating in decision making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I venture to say, even at this early stage, that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not accept that attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I give notice now, because of the sneeky way in which the Government brought this Bill into this chamber, that if in 6 months it reacts against the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> I shall introduce a private member’s Bill in this House to correct the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Government’s decision on the Fox inquiry and the potential danger to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from the lethal legacy of the past, will the Minister undertake to raise as a matter of urgency with the appropriate Minister the issues I have raised which he may not have had brought to his attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were the ones who tried to impress on the Federal Government, on our opponents in 1973, and on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the need to have those powers at the federal level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would not have been necessary for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have been dragged through the confidence trick put over them last year that the present Government somehow or other had a magic wand in its equipment and knew of some cures to our economic ills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After 12 months of total domination of the Parliament- Government members do not have to look over their shoulders at a hostile upper House the way we had to- after 12 months of being given every opportunity, the Government now has to come before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and say: ‘We have done nothing to solve the problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly they deal with questions which we as representatives of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should always have very much in the forefront of our considerations in this national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has indicated by the way in which it has allocated funds for public housing that it will not provide sufficient funds as to enable us to catch up and provide for the housing needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That fact alone clearly demonstrates which Party is firmly committed to attempting to provide for the housing needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The failure of the Government’s strategy is already evident to large sections of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly does not help the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fifteen or so months ago he was not even a member of the Parliament, but he is now paraded before the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and has the responsibility of bringing forward the legislative program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In other words, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are subsidising Ansett Transport Industries while it continues to maintain its high rate of profit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has done so at a time when it has endeavoured to take a large number of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> out of Australia on holidays at as cheap a rate as possible and with an unsurpassed safety record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has completely opted out of its responsibility to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the responsibility with which it is now charged to ensure that the Australian public receives a fair financial reward from the depletion and the exploitation of our assets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only a government which has the power to levy a profit related tax as a form of company income tax can satisfactorily ensure that the windfall gains accrue substantially to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> without at the same time imposing distortions on company decisions of the type which would lead to a less efficient allocation or resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not paranoid about multinational corporations, but it just happens to be a fact of life that if Australian companies reap excessive profits from their operations in Australia ultimately more of those gains accrue to the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> than would be the case if the excessive profits were made by companies which are owned abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I would hope is that the good taste of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be such that they would share the honourable senator’s revulsion at what to me is a horrible spectacle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think one ought to look at the basic situation which is a change in the method of the same thing and the logical national interest in continuing to support a facility which can add to Australia’s export income particularly in the capital goods area, and the willingness as a community to pick up the burden of the difference in cost for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who have to get that finance as against the price they can in effect get for thenfinance in world competitive situations for the finance facility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable  senators  may remember also that it was rejected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, has the Government initiated a program designed to protect the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from existing radioactive material in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said all the time that what we need in this country is a thorough and objective analysis- a bipartisan approachbecause the problems are the problems of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and should not be treated as part of a sort of political cat and mouse game. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would also be agreed that governments of both political colours have endeavoured to come to grips with the problem of providing adequate housing for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and especially for those on lower incomes so that they can have access to a home to which every member of the Australian community is entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It refers to the existing inequalities in relation to services that should be available to <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and in relation to those goals to which we all look forward to achieving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are entitled to have the time to read the Fox report and to assess it before Australia is committed to the status of a uranium supplier which may well prove to be a status from which future Australians will be unable to extract or will have difficulty in extracting Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the view that was expressed recently by the National Secretary of the Labor Party, David Combe when he said that he believed that within the next decade the issues of uranium and mining generally in Australia will be the biggest issues to be faced by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is precisely what the Fox inquiry seeks to do, namely, to have the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> consider and ponder the whole argument and discuss as a community the problems associated with the uranium industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taken together, this operates in terms of the major threat to the health and survival of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not important just to the Aboriginal people; I believe it is important to all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Uren said the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> owed an ‘enormous debt’ to the Timorese people who had helped Australians during World War II. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is true that the legislation under which the Memorial is administered provides that the trustees shall operate the Memorial on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They want the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> passively to accept that Indonesia’s generals have the right to decide on whether their neighbours can be free or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Australians one of our roles is to remind the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the debt we owe the Timorese for their assistance in aiding the preservation of our freedom in the Second World War. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But most importantly we have to let the Timorese know that in their struggle they have the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That was primarily the purpose of the ceremony, but nevertheless the opportunity was taken to remind the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the role the Timorese people played at that time alongside Australian soldiers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When I was in East Timor the East Timorese people took me to a spot in the hills around Dili where the Australian Government has erected a memorial and constructed a swimming pool as a permanent record of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’s recognition of and gratitude to those East Timorese- the 50 000 of them-who died during World War II in protecting the Australian troops during the period of the occupation of that area by the j apanese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is left of the legislation is a mess, and it is a discredit to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to broadcasting, which is a great and important institution in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But as a Parliament we are surely entitled, as the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are also entitled, to know what the reasons are for ignoring the advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the Government’s decision on the Fox Inquiry and the potential danger to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from the lethal legacy of the past, will the Minister treat these matters as urgent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-64-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the terms of the caption to the recent Pickering cartoon, what the Opposition is saying to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is this: ‘We got you into this mess and, by George, we 11 get you out ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With a very astute lawyer, a hijacker could say that on an impulse he hijacked a Qantas plane but that he has nothing against the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and thinks that they are wonderful people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>From this distance, I daresay it is a matter for the Western <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to make an assessment and a judgment as to whether they are better off under those policies of  Sir Charles  Court than they would be under the alternative policies of the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Chaney  also indicated the importance of the Pilbara and the North West Shelf to the growth in earnings of government and it is only by such growth that we can finance the increasing expectations of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Wriedt  recognised a matter that disturbs the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in a substantial degree, namely, that we do have a defence problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He said to me categorically with no apology whatsoever that the European people living in Australia- an Asian country, so he claimed- had no right to the resources available in Australia because these resources belong to the people of the world and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are keeping them to themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not say that this is a pervasive view anywhere in Asia but it is a view and it indicates that there is some thinking in certain Asian areas that Australia has no right to occupy this country, no right- if I may say in a general sort of way as I report this conversationto those resources that enable the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to have a high standard of living whereas the people from this person’s country have almost no resources or have exhausted their resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The effect of those arrows was to induce in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a sense of fear of threat of invasion from the north. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is phoney because it relies on imaginery threats created by the Liberal Party in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout 20 years of Australian history the only relevant facts in Australian defence debates which have concerned the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been threats from all sorts of mythical people, whether they be the Chinese of 10 years ago or the Russians of one year ago, as mentioned by Malcolm Fraser, or this faceless Asian man that  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack met 3 months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In that war the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> turned to the Labor Party because they believed it was fair dinkum about the defence of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was aware of  Senator Mulvihill  ‘s continued interest in it and, in any case, of the interest of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the need for assuring the highest degree of safety in the carriage of oil throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that the report of the Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty, an inquiry instituted by this Government and implemented by this Government but ignored by the Whitlam Government, should be compulsory reading for both sides of the Parliament and for the Western <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During this time the Prime Minister was attempting to persuade the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that devaluation would benefit them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not concerned with the theoretical arguments which are being advanced by the Government as a means of overcoming the nation’s problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us look at the record in late 1972 when in a fit of misguided optimism and false hope the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> passed to the Labor Party the custody of a very prosperous country which was doing well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at its record during its 3 years in office, at the end of which time the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, on the initiative of this chamber, finally threw it out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government had the responsibility given to it by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- let there be no doubt that that is where it came from- to tidy up that mess, to try to achieve stability, and then to grow and develop again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If honourable senators are here to serve the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, I suggest that is a line of argument they might knock off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate, in debating the state of the national economy, is endeavouring to bring before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the serious plight that faces so many sections of the Australian community and seeks to express a point of view in respect to the economic management policies pursued by this Government since it came to office some 15 months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He referred to reducing living standards so that international capital can get its hands on the meagre savings of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and so that capital intensive industries can develop the remaining natural resources of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We were conscious of the fact that, as a result of this slowing down in business activity and as a result of the increased expenditure that we had found necessary for social welfare, education and other long overdue necessities for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, we were faced with a very considerable problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think we have seen real evidence of the precautionary savings of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a certain caution in the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with regard to their disposable income and the savings which they are taking as precautions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In  Mr Fraser  ‘s policy speech in November 1975 he set out what he would do for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> recognise that it only takes a few minutes for a wild horse to kick down a barn but it takes many days for a skilled carpenter to rebuild it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the bluff that it pulled on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in November 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are waking up to the fact that in those months they were sold the greatest confidence trick in Australia’s history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No matter how the spokesmen on the other side of the Chamber have tried to manipulate figures and falsify the position today, their bankruptcy is becoming increasingly clear to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe, therefore, that the Senate as a chamber of longer membership capacity than the House of Representatives is perhaps able to take a little longer view and has a singular function to perform for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the examination of capital works programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister: What benefits to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have flowed from the Government ‘s decision in the last Budget to phase out the coal export duty at a cost of more than $37m? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask also: Is it a fact that the foreign owned and controlled Utah Company Ltd has profited considerably by the levy abolition and that the company’s donation of $100,000 to Australian opera is small compensation to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for the large capital gain given to the foreign shareholders? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not everybody reads editorials and not everybody listens to the Senate, but I am sure that both listening to the Senate and reading editorials can form an important part of the opinion making process of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the argument for limiting the number of elections to which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are subjected because unfortunately the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> no longer see elections, as they might have done, as an opportunity to reflect their views and wishes and to influence the course of events. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, in that political situation in 1974, 48.3 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> voted in favour of the proposal to alter the Constitution in relation to simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be recalled that at that time  Mr Woolcott,  the Australian Ambassador to Indonesia, was alleged to have sent cables to the Department in Canberra asking the Australian Government to try to persuade the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that there was nothing all that bad about the Indonesian moves into East Timor and that they should not panic and saying that the Government should tend to play down the scene somewhat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So therefore it is urgent that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> determine for themselves the actual facts of the Rhodesian Struggle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-0-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose this would send the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into some sort of tizzy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far from this being something which can be turned against politicians by saying that we do not want more of them so we should vote against the proposal, I think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be ready to say that we have had over the years too many elections and too often and that situation will be solved by the proposed constitutional amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the matter that I wish to bring to the notice of the Senate, and perhaps to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, is of great importance to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am saddened that I should have to bring this matter to the attention of the Senate and of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am saddened because of the lack of thought that has been given to this matter by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; but, fortunately, at this moment I am able to congratulate the media of this country for highlighting the matter that I wish to bring to the attention of the Austraiian people and the Senate this evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a black man, as an Australian and as a Christian- although I might be accused by some people of not being a very good practising Christian, I believe that I am a Christian and that I follow the teachings of Christ- tonight, I wish to stand for Christ in what I have to say to this Senate and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that they came from courageous people whose liberty, as well as that of their friends, could be jeopardised if we were to reveal to the Senate and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the source of that information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not be deflected from the true reasons for this measure- a measure which was pioneered by the Labor Government- which are that it is a more rational, more sensible and less expensive way of conducting elections for the Federal Parliament to have them synchronised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However I feel that in 1 977 in Australia the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be given the opportunity to pass judgment on this question, particularly as it was supported by such a wide spectrum of responsible elected representatives in the 3 tiers of government at the Hobart Convention in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not accept any of those arguments because the action mat was taken then was the action that was required by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and they upheld it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Senate is composed of members who, for the main part, represent the major political parties, that reflects a fact of deliberate political choice by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I presume that it was the Constitutional Convention which suggested that the referendum be placed before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; it was not the Australian Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, the legislation we support here today merely proposes that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> be given an opportunity to decide at a poll on certain proposed changes to the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that in 1974 the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> returned the Whitlam Government in the House of Representatives and in a simultaneous election for the whole of the Senate they failed to give  Mr Whitlam  control of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a Bill which seeks to undermine the stability and power of the Senate and by so doing undermine the stability and power of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may continue by dealing with the issues that are to be put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the referenda, I remind the Senate that these include the matter of simultaneous elections - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have great confidence that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will do no damage to our democracy by their votes in the forthcoming referenda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are unlikely to be hoodwinked by the sorts of arguments that have been presented to this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principles involved and the philosophy of what simultaneous elections mean to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have all been thrown overboard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would think that any senator in this chamber who is really concerned about Australia and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and not his or her own little privileged power position here should support this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am equally happy to say- I will not weary the Senate- that there are signs that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are now moving more to support Australia Post and that the decline, which had been a significant one of 12 per cent, in postage in 1975-76 appears to have been arrested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the interesting things- and I hope that it is a sign of things to come- is that the volume of Christmas cards committed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> through Australia Post last Christmas at the concessional rate was some 16 per cent higher than in the previous year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I for one hope that die <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will have greater and greater confidence in the service and that we will build a stronger system through the new techniques. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I imagine that would be most unpopular with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> if it did happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have decided now to leave it to the good judgment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to make a final decision on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a necessary amendment to the Constitution and one which we believe will receive the approval of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, having regard to the conduct of State governments in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The presence in Australia of Your Majesty and of His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh has once again brought the greatest pleasure to your <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a commitment to increasing the freedom, opportunity and equality of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- giving people an opportunity to make their own choices and to live their own lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the heart of my Government’s policies lie a commitment and a concern; commitment to increasing the freedom, opportunity and equality of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; and concern with enhancing people’s ability to make their own choices and live their own lives in their own way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It deluded the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into believing that it had the answers to the problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Medibank, wage indexation and a whole range of social service programs have been emasculated or abandoned to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and the fear now exists that the Government will erode the value of pensions by varying the automatic adjustment for inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But is it not to be expected that if the Australian community is to respond to increased privileges for the private sector, that must be demonstrated in the capacity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to increase their consumption of goods produced in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it has to be realised that the Government cannot expect those things to happen when the whole of its program is being defeated as a result of widespread uncertainty amongst the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will become more disillusioned as time goes by, and no doubt disillusionment has already been expressed in some State elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that when the result of the next election is known we will see a change back to policies which recognise the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and which seek to give equity and genuine assistance to those in the Australian community who really need it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am disappointed that the Leader of the Opposition stood up and had the audacity to demand that this Government bring down inflation and bring down the unemployment level, when he was a senior Minister in the government that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> know was responsible for the economic mess that this country is in at the moment and the high rate of inflation we are suffering at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> remember, as  Senator Wriedt  was so happily trying to make them do, what has happened in the past 1 8 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> thought it was time for a change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The prosperity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> depends on the strength of its productive private sector, on its manufacturing, mining and rural industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Government is not only taking action to restore the economy, it is also making social reforms which are of fundamental importance to the freedom and well-being of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our prime goal, apart from bringing down inflation, must be to get the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> back to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my travels through not only my own State but also through other States of the Commonwealth I am finding- it is very sad to have to say this-that perhaps too many <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are becoming lazy and greedy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst there are so many people unemployed, the money that we pay to the Government in the form of taxation is fast running out and the government may not have sufficient money to provide all the services, apart from social security, required by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must protect <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> leaving our shores for whatever reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Being one who has taken some interest in the welfare of rural people in New South Wales, I agree with that contention but I would would emphasise to  Senator Lewis  that the members of the Government Parties are not the only ones who have an interest in the welfare and well-being of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally, especially those in rural areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, realising that that argument was not getting over to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, in the last period we have seen a deliberate and concerted attack on the trade union movement and the workers of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No longer do the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> accept the Government as being authoritative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No longer do the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believe the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No longer do the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believe that the Government can unite the nation because the Government has deliberately set out to create divisions within the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not swallow such stories any longer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this policy could be seen by the Australian community as contributing to a dramatic recovery in economic terms, then I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> perhaps would have accepted the sacrifices they have been forced to make as a result of Government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Action should have been taken very early in the piece to see that the employment needs of the Commonwealth Employment Service were able to give effective service to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the Senate, to the Australian Parliament and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that in responding to the address by  Her  Majesty we should say that this Government has been an abysmal failure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has failed to face up to any aspect of its undertakings and it stands condemned in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not go for that sort of fraud today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While there is a promise of more freedom for individuals and a promise to increase and foster the strength and independence and creativity of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, it is clear that the sort of legislation to be brought down will make conditions worse for the ordinary working man and for the unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are going to take that excuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government took the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for a ride in the election in December 1975 and carried the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At present, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must be convinced that the promised recovery has not taken place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to speak at some length on the harshness with which the Labor Party dealt with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is to a great deal of shame to members of the Opposition that some of the achievements of the recovery over the last 12 months have not been made as clear to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as they would like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not aware of the arguments put forward in the High Court in Melbourne yesterday but I am able to say that there is a Social Services Act which provides for benefits and pensions for <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> if they meet the terms of eligibility for those pensions and benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders of thought, leaders in education, social welfare and community education, also have a responsibility to remind the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that if we talk about having the right to work, when the opportunity to work comes it should be taken and not ignored so that people can live at the taxpayers’ expense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think it has had a great effect on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> except perhaps to reveal the promoter as somewhat pathetic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Government has not put forward a case that would satisfy me and perhaps would satisfy many of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who elect senators to this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am concerned about producing a good and sensible document for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from the work that has been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It does not attempt to deal with the issues that are facing either the Parliament or the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr President, this year, 1977, is the Silver Jubilee Year of the reign of  Her  Majesty the Queen, who has honoured the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and this Parliament by her visit to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The enthusiastic welcome expressed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> demonstrated clearly the affection and respect in which the Queen is held in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the welcome expressed by Australians shows what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> think about the monarchy, I am quite convinced that we will have the monarchal system, not for 10 years or 20 years as some honourable senators mentioned in their speeches, but for many hundreds of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am quite sure that, despite the poll that was taken in some suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne, the great majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are still of the opinion that we have the best set-up in the present circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the heart of my Government’s policies lie a commitment and a concern; commitment to increasing the freedom, opportunity and equality of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; and concern with enhancing people’s ability to make their own choices and live their own lives in their own way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from a few shibboleths, such as ‘increasing the freedom, opportunity and equality of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’ and acknowledging some of the Government’s band-aid approaches to the problems of our society, the speech told us nothing and gave us only cliches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The prosperity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> depends on the strength of its productive private sector, on its manufacturing, mining and rural industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a matter upon which, with the best will in the world, it will be very hard for people to reach agreement and achieve a solution which ought to be put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The presence in Australia of Your Majesty and of His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh has once again brought the greatest pleasure to your <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the months have elapsed it has been proven time and again that it will remain an issue in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have failed the sense of fair play of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I assure the Senate that either on this occasion or on some future occasion officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs will be brought before a parliamentary committee and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in order to explain their actions in relation to East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the emphasis of this paper clearly indicates the necessity for this Government and for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to look at foreign policy over an extended period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If Australia- a country rich in food, minerals, energy, space; a country far removed geographically from other developed countries; a sparsely populated country; a country with a black minority- is to move successfully through a quarter century in which issues of resources, economic inequality, food, race, population are going to assume an unprecedented importance, then it is essential that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole become involved in and informed about the process of shaping our foreign policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We opine that in the cause of humanity and ecological conservation, the views of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should be expressed in a vigorous manner by the Australian Government to the Canadian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A somewhat lengthy answer could be given to many of the matters which have been raised, but I think what I have said indicates that there are suitable arrangements to provide for the production to meet the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator mentioned cuts expected in the Budget that will be prepared by the Government for presentation to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in August. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In short, it is a machinery Bill to enable the ballot boxes and polling booths to be used in connection with the taking of the referendum on Saturday, 2 1 May, to be used also in connection with a poll concerning the recommendation of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the Australian Government on the choice of Australia’s national song. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention those matters not because I am of Scottish descent or because I might be a Presbyterian by religion but because I am Australian and I think  Advance Australia Fair  is more Australian than any of the other songs to be put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for their choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not object to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> being given the opportunity to express their choice of a national song by means of the ballot box. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that those surveys showed that 75 per cent to 85 per cent of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> interviewed favoured some control over the amount and content of advertising on commercial television? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A range of benefits and pensions are available to <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who do qualify through residence, age or some other form of eligibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the uncertainty which such irresponsible statements create in the field of industry and commerce will the Minister reassure the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that no such step is contemplated by the Government in the immediate future? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a tendency not to like to be stood over by any other people or by any other government, even if that government is the government of a country with a large population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Government acknowledge fully this outstanding and voluntary contribution by Australian ophthalmologists acting in the highest traditions of the medical profession and for the benefit of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If not, does the Government publicly admit that the Minister for Overseas Trade was misleading the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year in Tasmania we had people with enough confidence in our marketing to ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to support them for a few more years until we could become established in the Japanese market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not have a pretty record as far as Aboriginals are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The prosperity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> depends on the strength of its productive private sector, on its manufacturing, mining and rural industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is considering the proposal but we will not commit ourselves on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> without seeing what is the basis of the proposal and examining it in some depth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has not been my wish that it should be tabled in the Senate, but if there is to be continued criticism of the lack of maintenance to these schools in the Northern Territory, as if this happened only in the last year, then I suggest to the Minister for Education that this departmental report be tabled in the Senate so that the rest of the Senate and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally can judge for themselves who is at fault. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Timorese are very much in close relationship with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, it was a source of embarrassment to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that governments have to make decisions about whether they want to interfere in the affairs of other countries by way of armed incursions and that it is the responsibility of governments to do that as governments and as elected representatives of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that is worth noting by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They asked me to go back to Australia and ask the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to give them the kind of assistance that I have already outlined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On top of that, the  President  said to me: ‘We also ask that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> send a delegation to arbitrate between the 3 different groups in our country and to bring us together so that we can discuss these problems, sit down rationally and talk about them and do something about bringing our people together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ask you to go back to your country and ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian Government to send a team of people to be arbitrators to help us to solve our problems.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeated that statement because I believe it should be indelibly imprinted on the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we are asking is that an investigation be carried out by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence We are asking for an investigation to be carried out and for the allegations to be looked at but not only as far as the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that Indonesia and we as <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will welcome an investigation and that we will look at the allegations to ascertain whether there is any truth in them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, they fought alongside of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely that is the least we can ask of this Parliament and the least we can ask of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are very thankful for the support from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and also from the trade union movement but we are quite sad for the attitude of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The information I am going to quote illustrates very clearly the extent of the problem and the numbers of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who are involved or who would wish to be involved in technical and further education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That sort of attitude will destroy whatever this Government or any government tries to do and it will also destroy what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want to happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is quite simple and quite proper that we should point out that the industrial relations policy that we put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> more than 2 years ago contains a capacity to develop a proper measure of restraint and a proper measure of direction in the area of productivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe there is no doubt that  Senator Harradine  also would concur in opposing secondary boycotts, as does the vast majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the trade union movement would completely agree with that pronounced policy of the caretaker Prime Minister who was seeking a mandate and endorsement from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because this Government believes that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must be protected from the harsh effects of industrial disruption, that the rights of the individual are terribly important but that individuals have responsibilities to carry out, the penalties have been made more realistic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the rank and file unionists realise that in the past the unions have escaped from much responsibility for their actions, that they have held the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to ransom, that they have tried to take over the job of the properly elected government  of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a duty and a responsibility to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the East Timorese and the refugees to seek the truth in these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a course which we, as human beings and members of Parliament representing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, must take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once that relationship can be re-established there exists in the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a capacity to ameliorate the conditions that have caused so much distress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reparation of that relationship will enable the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to mitigate and to obtain satisfaction in the matters that are distressing the Senate and which the Senate is debating tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is within our province as members of this Parliament, as elected representatives of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as citizens as well as humanitarians, as those concerned with the rights of others, to make a determination and, I suggest, a favourable determination on this motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is urgent for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to determine for themselves, the actual facts of the Rhodesian struggles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770426_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One might equally say that there is a duty on Australian governments to protect <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have obviously reached the situation in which the employment of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in that industry is of paramount importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are looking quite critically at the overall rate of use of clothing and textiles in Australia, at the overall ability of Australians to help other countries by having some imports from them and at the overall ability to help <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to maintain their employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of great interest and, I think, of great value to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that there has been a development of the higher education authorities throughout Australia and that there has been a tendency by State governments to set up inquiries into post-secondary education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would be interested in a South Australian content. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do we help the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to create opportunities and living standards and gainful employment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the end we want the White Paper to be a document which this Government and future governments of our character, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and manufacturing industry will recognise as a document which makes clear what we all feel and think about this industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we try to do in the White Paper is to say what will be the broad shape of the economy, how its employment characteristics will move, how we will look to maximise the opportunities of the people of Australia, what the best way is to look after those people and to help them to do the best possible job for themselves and their country, what should be our balance of trade position and the balance of local opportunity, how we should best add value to the natural raw materials we find or grow them in the ground, and how to maximise the opportunities for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I close my remarks by saying that I am motivated by a simple proposition: It is my job and the Department’s job through the Government to produce a result which is for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> totally and in the public interest and not for any particular private vested interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This debate highlights to the Parliament and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> another broken promise of the Fraser Government, and that is its failure to produce and to publish the White Paper for the development of manufacturing industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, that was 1 8 months ago, and the Parliament, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, the manufacturing industry and those who have lost their jobs from industry as a direct result of the policies of this Government still await that White Paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that those statistics were based on the 1971 census and not on the 1976 census because, in order to cut back on public expenditure, this Government’s policy has been to phase down the analysis of the census of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that was taken in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He fought for that point of view within the party room and at the last Federal Conference of our party which he attended at Terrigal in New South Wales where he made the important distinction that our natural resources should be developed by the public sector so that the tremendous benefits from such development would flow directly back to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though that is an improvement on the existing rates scale, surely the Government does not believe that that will have any measurable impact on the living standards of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when today it has been announced that in the month of July, for example, food prices in this country increased by one per cent throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But what the Minister on behalf of the Government has failed to tell the Parliament, and of course, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, is precisely how the Government arrived at an export figure of 53 per cent of current estimated reserves which, according to those who advise us, are of the order of six and a half trillion cubic feet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Once again, I would have thought that the Labor Party would have some regard to the employment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> accept- I believe that they do- the importance of the alternative system of education in Australia and also that there is a responsibility on government ‘s State and Federal, to provide a minimum level of funding, which is all the Government has sought to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When can the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> expect action by the Government to improve library services throughout Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said at times in the past that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had reached the stage of disillusionment but at no time in our history has there been such widespread concern at what is happening in this country at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now very clearly the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are turning their support away from this Government to the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At last the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are realising that it has gone wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said in opposition early last year- I have not bothered to turn up the quotethat the new federalism policy was designed for political purposes in 1975 and would be a failure and a detriment to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not tolerate it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer, for instance, to one of the conclusions of the conference of the Labor Party in Perth just very recently when it decided that the economic recipe with which it would confront the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> from this time on to overcome the problems that are to be found in our economy was the identical economic recipe that produced the very problems to which that Party refers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The overall situation is that we are saying to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for a reason which I cannot understand that we have to face the unemployment situation knowing that the rate will be even higher than it currently is <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are indeed sick of the strategy of this Government in the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian Parliament would agree with the Labor Government that it should not be allowed to continue any longer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having suggested the vast benefits which a satellite service would make available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, that statement goes on: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, again, is just typical of the sort of statements this Minister has made about broadcasting and the sort of statements which he just cannot carry out in terms of real provision of services to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, particularly those in remote areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that will impress the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are concerned about the steadily increasing rate of unemployment within this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am afraid that that is not going to impress the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The further we get away from December 1975 the harder it will be to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that what is now happening is the result of anything that the Labor Government did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For no other reason than the fear of the wrath of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> if the Government waited to go to an election at the appropriate time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If ever an irresponsible proposition was put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, it is the constant questioning by a pseudo-economist and pseudo-Deputy Leader of the Opposition in this country and his casting doubt on the value of the Australian currency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we left office in 1972, 30 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who were registered as unemployed actually sought the benefit; but when we came back into office that 30 per cent had increased to 70 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In four short years the whole philosophy of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had changed from putting some money away for a rainy day and looking after themselves to putting out their hands as soon as they are unemployed and claiming the benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole philosophy of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is being undermined and ruined by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore there will be no democratic test by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for at least 5!6 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The essence of the result of the 1975 election is simply that the Australian Labor Party, despite the method by which it confronted the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, was found wanting by the Austraiian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are important not only to me but also to a large number of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the present levy was indiscriminate and unfair in operating across the board on all coal company profits, the industry is healthy enough to sustain a selective tax to increase the return to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were told by this Government that as inflation was brought down  so too  would unemployment fall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate has been discussing an important and constructive budget; a budget that has brought into being some new tax reforms, long sought and long awaited by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; a budget that provides a framework for the continued attack upon inflation which, according to an indicator mentioned by  Senator Douglas  McClelland a moment a go, now stands somewhere below 10 per cent and, on his figure, actually at 9.2 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had elections that perhaps were thought would be elections on other issues, but basically the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are concerned with what group of men and women is best capable of continuing to operate the economy of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The support they received from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> has been taken away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is quite a large vessel and will involve quite a large bill for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to pick up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the veracity of gallup polls has been challenged sometimes in the past, it is interesting to note that all the polls that have been published over the last several weeks have shown that unemployment is now the issue that is worrying the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The latest gallup poll out today shows that 75 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believe that unemployment is the issue that should be the responsibility of governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inflation has receded in the thinking of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of those minor items of drafting which appear to us to be unsatisfactory are even more unsatisfactory in legislation of this kind which is appropriately a matter of concern to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, a matter which should be clear and specific in its intentions and not subject to the sort of ambiguities and vagaries which this Bill is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that many of the recommendations that we have made, if implemented, would contribute a great deal to the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, particularly with respect to land use planning which is an area which we believe has been neglected and an area in which State and Federal governments ought to get together in order to ensure that proper policies are introduced to deal with that aspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was made clear that we would do what we could to help, that we had done more than most countries to liberalise our trading with other countries and that we would continue to try to do so but our first obligation was to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and those employed in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not going to be gulled into believing that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Goodness, gracious me, we had a change in 1972, 1973, 1974 and up to 1975 when the people of Australia suddenly decided that that change was not in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, it has made a considerable reduction in the tax burden of the ordinary <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of concern to governments in terms of funding and it is of concern to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in terms of what they get in the way of delivery of service by governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The standard of living of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> depends upon the strong demands of the unions to improve conditions, social services, education, housing and a host of other things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last two speeches have been very interesting, because they have indicated how greatly out of touch is the Opposition with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who, I have no doubt, regard any legislation in this field as extremely urgent and probably overdue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He does not worry about any principle; he does not worry about the principle of where the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> stand on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I welcome the report of the Sub-committee, which I believe has done something to inform the Australian Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the problems involved in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a very important matter for the whole of Australia, not only for the Government and its policies but also for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- those who save money, those who invest, those who hope to see economic recovery clearly sustained and those who hope to see employment improve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said: ‘Sooner or later the Government has to face up to this issue and go to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and say: “We are prepared to govern with courage and a sense of responsibility , but you have got to back us “. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The issue today in Australia is an issue as to whether the Government can confuse the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by saying that proper economic recovery can be achieved only through repressing the trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Quite frankly, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are fed up with pleading with the unions to behave and to be reasonable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But the Liberal-National Country Party Opposition said: ‘No, it is a bad thing because it will take away from us one of the weapons we use at election time to stir up industrial strife and to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that these are issues they should be looking at’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is designed to divert the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> away from the real issues that are confronting this country at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As many as 10 per cent of school children between the ages of 12 and 17 become very drunk at least once a month, yet the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> say that alcohol is not a drug. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as I am concerned he will do me for a long time yet and he will do the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for a long time yet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When the Labor Party was thrown out of office by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> it did not set about trying to rehabilitate itself, as we did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us contrast that with what was passed over to it by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for it to take care of on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Forward-looking policies were being projected in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, one would have thought that Opposition members in this place today and in the other place yesterday would have regarded a debate of this nature as a golden opportunity to put forward positive policies that presumably they propose to put to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the next federal election, whenever that might be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sooner or later, the Government has to face up to this issue and go to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and say: ‘We’re prepared to govern with courage ana with a sense of responsibility, but you ‘ve got to back us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take the opportunity on the first reading of this money Bill, the Oilseeds Levy Bill 1977, to refer to two subjects which are of particular interest to me and which 1 believe are of considerable interest to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apparently the people of Australia are asked to accept the word of a Prime Minister whose word has never been answered for in questions which have been directed to him, a Prime Minister in whom, according to the polls, 27 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that the  President  of the Senate, whom I see sitting in this Committee, as the  Chairman  of the Standing Orders Committee has a great responsibility not only to the Parliament but also to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to see that every step is taken to bring up to date- to bring into line with modern-day practice, custom and convention in society- the Standing Orders of this place so that every honourable senator has the right of effective speech in this Parliament on behalf of the people who elect us to this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those three gentelmen, purportedly representing the Labor Party in Australia, the alternative to the Government, appeared in the media and disagreed vehemently before members of the media and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to whom they spoke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is what the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would like to know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He does not worry about any principle; he does not worry about the principle of where the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> stand on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I regret that it was not until he got on to the very last part of those several subjects which he raised that he in fact found himself talking about things which really interest the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and which are matters of some concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in all States will find that any benefits they may derive from the taxation concessions granted by this Government will be taken away by the additional taxes that will be imposed by the State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is exactly where we are heading and I hope that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at large realise the implications of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the two facts that  Mr Justice  Fox has reported, namely, that there is general opposition overseas to the United States and Canadian propositions that there could be no reprocessing of uranium supplied by those countries without the specific approval of supplier countries and that there is concern overseas that the International Atomic Energy Agency may not be able to administer nuclear safeguards satisfactorily, how does the Australian Government intend to maintain the fictional assurances given to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that Australian safeguards will be met completely by overseas takers of our uranium exports? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without a single shadow of doubt we have embarked upon one of the greatest conspiracies that has ever affected the Australian economy- a marrying and a merging of an interest of people who have no real interest in the Australian economy and no real interest in the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, except to plunder that which is available to them under the seven Bills before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister agree that the reluctance by the Foreign Affairs Minister to allow  Mr Justice  Fox to speak directly to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on this crucial matter- a matter on which the people will be expected to vote in a few weeks time- is serving to confuse the uranium debate and hence cast more doubts by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about the Government’s policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If that article does not give thinking concerned Australians something to think about and if they do not want to do something about the matter, I have certainly misjudged the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an occasion which impresses upon candidates the honour and dignity of citizenship and the responsibilities and privileges they take as <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When can the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> expect to have that promise fulfilled? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation will not be dealt with before the Parliament rises because the Government wants to hide the facts from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fortunately the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can see the picture in this issue quite clearly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I close by saying, as I said earlier, that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are awake to what is being done by this Government in the educational field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not think that there is any uncertainty at all as to what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will do in December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite sure that on 10 December the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will make a judgment which will ensure that 1978 will not be the disaster which 1976 was and which 1977 has been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only in his capacity as a judge therefore, but also in relation to those in inquiries I think he had a most unique and distinguished record so far as the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that his family will find consolation in knowing that he had a fine life, one deserving of great credit and favour from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we cannot come to grips with these matters- there is no indication in the GovernorGeneral’s Speech that they have even been thought about- to that extent Parliament will continue to appear to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to be increasingly irrelevant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is just possible that this appointment may have a salutary effect in the long run if it turns out to be the beginning of a process of showing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to what sort of man they have entrusted the highest political office in this country, the prime ministership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement by the former Prime Minister that he was the greatest Foreign Minister in Australian history exemplified in the minds of many <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what was so wrong with the members of the Party described by the Melbourne  Age  as behaving like a mob of schoolboys who had just found the key to the tuckshop which was unattended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As it was so close to the date of the election, one wonders why  Mr Peacock  could not have informed the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the Government’s intention before 10 December so as to allow the citizens of Australia to vote on this issue, to make up their minds whether they believed that Indonesia had the right to move in and take over East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite frankly,  Mr Peacock  could offer some redress to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by resigning his ministerial portfolio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a right to be protected against the actions of terrorists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also agreed with her conclusion, in looking at the voting for the Senate, that this Government had nothing to cheer about because more than 54 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had not voted for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also believe that a large proportion of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who voted to oust the Labor Government at that time had some misgivings about the way in which the election was engineered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have seen in action the regime of a small, select elite living in an ivory tower- an allknowing elite which was or would have been the final arbiter of the way of life that small elite would select as best for all of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know Parliament is popularly viewed with ridicule and cynicism, and that it is believed that it has no worthwhile role in the mainstream of government administration and that generally the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> hold this institution in very low esteem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact I would have thought that  Senator James  McClelland, as other members of the Australian Labor Party have done, was exposing the fact that through the actions of Kerr while he was the Governor-General of Australia the whole democratic constitutional parliamentary system was brought into contempt amongst a great many <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The sooner he vacates his present occupation and retires into oblivion, the better it will be for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and certainly the better it will be for Paris. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More than one  speaker  in this AddressinReply debate has drawn attention to the fact that parliament has not got a very good image in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the only people who can rectify that situation are members of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Government relies entirely upon the general public as part of its general strategy to get the economy movingthat is, it expects consumer demands to increase, one is entitled to say that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not responding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I do not think we are entitled to say that this Government can rely automatically upon the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is true the Government must have a very perverse view of the aspirations and interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because they are just not responding to all the blandishments of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To delude the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as the Governor-General has done, into believing that such policies can provide them with the knowledge that they can plan ahead with security and that their efforts will be rewarded is nothing short of criminal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the objectives my Government has set itself have been endorsed unequivocally by the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, my Government is determined to act as a Government of the whole and not a Government for the majority alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will set out to ensure that the social and economic rights of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are preserved and protected from a government which, we suggest, has already shown its ignorance of the problems and its arrogance in relation to the solutions to those problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether it be three years, or four years as apparently Government supporters are proposing in their party room, that we are in Opposition, I assure the Senate and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Labor movement will be strong and effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst all the contributions which have been made in this debate are desirable, I think that we should not fall into the trap of thinking that work on this objective is not proceeding as it ought to proceed so that we will have in 1988 a Parliament House which is worthy of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is axiomatic that the way back to restoring the export-import balance is for us to get inflation and interest rates down so that we can do two things- cost ourselves back into export trade and restore manufacturing in Australia, thus restoring more jobs for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and not need to import. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At about the same time the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> started to become concerned about what they regarded as the vast yellow hordes moving south and decided that what Australia needed was people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Church has persisted in bringing to the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> its disquiet at the Queensland Government’s unilateral action in support of the mining companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We as a Federal Government have a commitment, through the referendum proposals which were passed overwhelmingly by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, to accept responsibility on behalf of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was the desire and expressed will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for the Federal Parliament, where necessary, to make laws with respect to Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that is the expressed will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in recent terms, having regard to the history of our Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the letter he made it quite clear that in any areas where there were joint powers between the Commonwealth and Queensland, the Commonwealth will should prevail in a matter on which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> had expressed their views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It surely must be obvious that Australia’s needs are best served by making the wishes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> clear to the Indonesian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whilst I can understand the historic nature of the legislation before us, I am of the opinion that it fails to attain the objectives which the Government has so clearly announced to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> both previously and in the Minister’s second reading speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, the Premier is endeavouring to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it is we- and honourable senators have to accept the fact that we have common ground in respect of our attitude to apartheid- who are creating apartheid when in fact in practice it is the Premier who espouses that very principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This most serious use of the English language and the defiance of the expressed will of the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> must not be taken lightly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder what benefits the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will derive from that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot accept that it has no validity, bearing in mind that no High Court could give a judgment on a subsequent challenge to the legislation contrary to the overwhelming support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> given to the Australian Government by the referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore one can say only that  Senator Carrick  is completely misleading the Senate and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in his endeavours to say that - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a matter that concerns the cheating of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, of the Australian taxpayers, by these unscrupulous and perhaps sometimes unwitting people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As one examines it one leans to the view that it says things which are basically mischievous and can do no good in the problem that confronts the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless the statement is carefully analysed it can contribute little more than confusion, distortion and a loss of confidence by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is genuinely attempting to find those who are guilty of defrauding the Department and consequently the great mass of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, to run them to earth and treat them as justice requires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>that at least 51 per cent of the equity in the lands, and the developments and industries associated therewith, be vested in the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>that the Japanese company accept leasehold tenure only, thus ensuring an ultimate reversion to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not for me as a Minister at this distance to evaluate the pluses or minuses of the project and it is not for anyone else to do so without a knowledge of the environmental impact study, without a knowledge of the report from the Foreign Investment Review Board and without knowing what are basically the terms of the agreement with the Queensland Government and what is in the small print as to the nature of the undertaking, the involvement of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, whether it will be something that will create substantial employment for Australians and whether it can attract considerable tourism to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore I remind honourable senators that the Commonwealth Government and the State governments have within their responsibilities the task of ensuring that what is done in the development of Australia is in the total interest of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In presenting this Bill the Government is honouring its undertakings to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Governments of the States and territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth decision implements the Liberal and National Country Parties’ policy of Aboriginal selfmanagement, endorsed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in December 1975 and 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission said that the Australian Government cannot avoid the responsibilities entrusted to it by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the 1 967 Referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>United States of America overlooks the Australian Government’s commitment to see that the terms of the referendum which was carried overwhelmingly by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in 1967 are upheld. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that if we were to work together instead of trying to be divisive on the matter we would achieve more in the mutual interests of the Aborigines of Australia and of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we do not have the power to acquire land for the purpose of establishing settlements then we must make another appeal to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to give us that power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are supposed to be God-fearing, Christian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I charge the Government with dishonesty because it has taken the view that it can misrepresent the facts about uranium to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That in itself should be a great lesson to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, who are being hoodwinked by the propaganda machine which daily and weekly is pushing out the idea that this is a safe proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite a number of authorities from the United States took part in a seminar on the mining and exporting of Australian uranium, and it was concluded that the matter is far from settled in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason, we on this side of the chamber will continue to use whatever methods we can through the media to warn the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, whenever we have the opportunity, as we have done on so many occasions in the past when we have seen thoughtless people, opportunists, people after a fast buck who have been prepared to sell their fellow men down the drain for the immediate gain, disregarding the longer range view that we have taken on these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only reason for not doing so is that we might not approve of the safeguards, and the 50 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who do not approve of uranium mining at the moment might also not approve of the safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole rationale behind this extraordinary legislation must raise suspicions in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It rather likes the idea that the sovereignty of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is threatened by tying Australia into the world nuclear fuel cycle, which is controlled at its key points by ruthless commercial and political interests which do not hesitate to move into countries and to crush popular opposition to their commercial ambitions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been variously described in second reading speeches as honouring the Government’s ‘undertakings to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the governments of the States and the Territories’ and as being a carefully controlled and responsible measure for developing Australia’s uranium resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far from honouring the Government’s undertakings to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the governments of the States and Territories, the Government is proceeding quite against its declared policy, a policy declared in the Governor-General’s Speech in the middle of February, of ‘protecting the civil liberties of all Australians’ and of intending ‘to work in partnership with all groups’- not just the Peko/EZ group- in order to ‘revitalise our Federal system by co-operating with State and local governments’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Drawing on his considerable will, knowledge and experience, he guided Australia for 16 years, with the steadfast hand of a leader sure of his ground and sure in the judgment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  years of strong and stable government gave strength and confidence to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and set the nation firmly on a course of recovery and unprecedented development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all and in this connection,  Sir Robert  was concerned about the educational and cultraldevelopment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are great achievements for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and are acknowledged as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are sure that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would want us to have a fair trial in this matter which is so vitally important to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are concerned that the Commonwealth Government, which is negotiating on our behalf, does not appear to be prepared to allow us to obtain one before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are now in 1 978 and we ask, will the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> allow a minority native group to be forever deprived of title to its land for no other reason that it is a minority racial group? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not want this, nor do we want the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to owe us a living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that these two communities are ready for self-management and, as I said in this place when we dealt with the legislation, we would consider acquisition of the land if this were the only way in which our own policy for Aborigines could be achieved consistent with our responsibilities under the powers that were given to the Commonwealth by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is trying to foist on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the contradictory concept of a national park that contains hazardous and destructive uranium mining sites within its region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, we believe that such an amendment would be in the interests of the Aboriginal people and would do no harm to the interests of the Director or the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know that the first accident will bring to a head the resolve of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to leave uranium alone- to leave the Park whole and untouched. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am bound to say we are concentrating on this aspect, but the real situation will come when the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> press upon the education system to ensure that the basic skills and the core curricula are directed towards proper goals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On whatever basis, the prospect is for expanded Australian consular services in more centres at inevitably increased costs- not to provide a travel service for a privileged few, but in order to provide a truly public service for a large and growing proportion of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said yesterday, I think those who have the interests of Aboriginals at heart are supported by the majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know in my heart that if we did, the conscience of the Australian Mining Industry Council would be pricked because of what it wants to perpetrate on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and it would give a little more in regard to the rigid codes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There seems to me to be only one course of action to take- to ask the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to alter the Constitution to remove the requirement which obliges public servants to resign to contest a Federal election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Attention was excited in a very keen way by a proposal concerning the former Governor-General,  Sir John  Kerr, already by special Act of this Parliament in receipt of an ex-Governor-General ‘s salary equivalent to the retiring salary of a Chief Justiceby the way, I had the honour to contribute two vital objections to it when we voted on itbecause he had taken a notable and distinguished, and probably an epoch-making decision in the constitutional development of this country to the great satisfaction of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who registered their approval of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, a large proportion of the Australian work force works in situations like those depicted in the novel and the proposed film would deal with the activities of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ten per cent or even 50 per cent of the truth is as good a way of misleading this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a downright lie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is why we think it so necessary to say every now and then what we have said in this place today; that is, to warn the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that unless they are vigilant about what happens to the ABC it could soon disappear as an important and enlightening factor in Australian life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These reforms- I ask honourable senators to mark the word ‘reforms’- in the taxation area have cost the Australian Government and saved the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> something like $2 billion in one full year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in reply- This ends the second reading debate on four quite important Bills which discharge a policy undertaking, made by the Fraser Government in its last election campaign, which has the widespread support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at least we can say that if we propose a sensible reform, which is acceptable across the board to <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, it is likely to be accepted by them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is clear from reading the papers of the current Convention that it has not found yet a solution to the major or most serious problems that have divided the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We committed to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at the time of the election last year and previously that no longer would personal income tax continue to rise because of consequential rises through inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time of the last election that was probably a fundamental issue in the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One must always remember that responsiveness to the specific needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is the primary responsibility of the government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a great deal of cynicism amongst the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when they read, as I suppose they will be reading in the next week or two, that at the last minute some ten, 20 or 30 Bills were rushed through the Parliament in the last couple of days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, if there is one thing that both sides of the Senate can be bipartisan in, it is the belief that extremes of views, whether they be of the extreme left or of the extreme right, are not the norm for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and are not the way of life which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> seek and respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe, therefore, that this legislation deserves the strong support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that we have an obligation to the Australian community to take whatever steps are available to us to alert the Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about the implications of the implementation of the present policies of the Fraser Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all accept the fact that no government does everything right and that no government pleases everyone; but when it can be demonstrated that a government has taken a wrong course, and the Prime Minister has indicated that the Government is to continue on that course, it is the responsibility of the Opposition to make that point obvious to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that by the time we come back to this Parliament in August it will have recognised that the policies it has been following over the past two and a half years are not only leading to greater unemployment in the Australian community but also to a greater lack of business confidence and a greater lack of confidence generally among the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Wriedt invites the Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to reflect upon the consequences of the Government’s policies over the past two and a half years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will be delighted so to do and to remind the Opposition and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what has happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We regard them as pluses in terms of the welfare of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was the edict given by the Australian Prime Minister to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> not long after the Federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are at a loss to know what is going on because in direct contradiction to what the Government has enunciated, as inflation has fallen unemployment has substantially risen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why are the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in a quandary? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last week the Minister announced to the Parliament and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that consultations were being undertaken and that a further announcement would be made at an appropriate time.- 1 also asked the Minister: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But clearly, they are the legacy of three years of socialism and quite clearly, that circumstance has been overwhelmingly rejected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> twice in  216  years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a remarkable performance, and it is one of the elements which should be starting to give to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a measure of confidence and a measure of recognition that they can return to the sort of successful prosecution to which they have been used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is clear that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are being overtaxed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first two Bills that I have mentioned represent what is the most central part of this Government’s economic policy, namely, the new federalism policy of which we have heard quite a lot in this Parliament, but the effects of which have not yet become fully apparent to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Ample opportunity was given to the Prime Minister to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the States would be given the power to introduce a State income tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one does exist then it is up to this Government, or any alternative government, to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what it will do to control and to contain those costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> may wish to avail themselves of a coverage that takes into account the use of the service or is selective in the areas for which people do not wish to be covered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all come to this place in the hope that we can do something of value not only for the Parliament but also for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is nice to remember that having been on the Constitutional Review Committee with a dissenting report in favour of maintenance of the Senate powers, in the only three referenda that have been put forward on this matter either by my side or by the Opposition, the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, according to the Constitution, have not accepted the view that was put that the Senate power should be eroded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that I can continue that sort of performance for the benefit of this chamber and that this chamber, with co-operation, will express itself to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for what it is- an important chamber in this Australian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#debate-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since the last Budget, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have overwhelmingly endorsed the Government’s  economic  policies and objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people of Mornington Island and Aurukun feel let down by the Australian Parliament and, indeed, by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Senate should see ourselves as being in a position of giving advice to the Australian Government to take the problem out of the too-hard basket and to take the necessary legislative action to put into effect the expressed view of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the referendum of 1 967 and the view of this place, which has been clearly expressed on the occasions when this matter has been debated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that it is in the interests of all that sufficient persuasion, pressure, influence- I do not care what it is called- is brought to bear upon the Australian Government in such a way that it will take the necessary steps given to it by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, expressed in the views of the Senate and, I am sure, by the majority representation in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is necessary for the Queensland Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to appreciate that there is widespread concern about the actions of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, it is an expression of confidence by overseas and <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that in the first half of next year we can get to a five per cent inflation rate which will put us in a better position than any country in the world, other than Germany and Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me give one example of the sort of allegation, and the sort of media headline that has caused a totally incorrect picture of the level of aviation safety in Australia to be presented to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I see that as the only way that Australia as a nation or the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will ever get a share out of such operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The classes that are provided, both pre-embarkation and shipboard, are in the English language- that is essential- but they also look at the Australian way of life and try to introduce the migrants to the mores and social customs of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again the matters of education and the concept of international relations and co-operation have all developed very considerably and have invoked the interest and involvement of more and more <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr President, if we are honest I think we can rationally expect worse to come rather than better unless the will and morale of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> improve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So far as the need to get greater co-operation with government by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is concerned, the clock stands at eleven. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was a principle which gave <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the highest percentage of home ownership in the world, and this happened under governments of Liberal faith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, those years of the Labor Government robbed the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of nearly 29,000 new houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a bad thing to be able to say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that, the Labor Government of the day having robbed them by way of inflation and interest rates, the latest consumer price index figures show that interest rates are running below 8 per cent, with the Budget projecting that they will go down through 7 per cent and 6 per cent to a prospect of their being 5 per cent in the middle of next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government may say that perhaps the standard of living of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is too high, but I am not going out to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to say that the standard of living that they set for themselves is too high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In any case, I believe that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are beginning to see that this Government does not regard our natural energy resources as belonging to the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This hike in petrol and petroleum products costs will have a disastrous effect, as indeed will the whole Budget, upon the disposable incomes of the vast majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at a time when the Government says it is concerned about the state of the economy, the lack of confidence and the inability of consumers to buy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not opposed to technological changes, but any change that does not take the present and future workers into account is bad and unacceptable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The values and commitments of the Liberal philosophy have, I believe, since Deakin ‘s day come to be accepted and supported by a majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Every senator on this side, as on the other side, has a right to be here, be they Liberal, Democrat, Independent or Labor, because every senator has gained a sufficient proportion of support from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we as an <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are not prepared to make the facilities available to them, are not prepared to fund these sporting bodies, why blame the sports men and women? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only thing that he told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to do was to tighten their belts and cut down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is important because the Budget Papers which we are discussing affect more than 13 million <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in one way or another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After saying that the Budget Papers which we are debating are important, let me say in another sense that I think that we the politicians, we the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, attach too much importance to Budget Papers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support these Budget Papers for a number of reasons but basically, and significantly I believe, because they are another expression of an economic and social line that has been promoted to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> twice in less than three years, an economic and social line that was overwhelmingly endorsed by the Australian electorate in December of 1 975 and again as recently as December 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only have these propositions been endorsed by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> twice in this time but in fact they are continually being endorsed by people within and without this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The main thrust of the amendments it contains has three principal aims, all of which are directed towards creating an improved framework which will assist the Organisation to continue to serve the nation well in the years ahead and to optimise the benefits to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that can be derived from national government-financed scientific endeavour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether people agree with me in the conclusions I draw is not the important aspect, but I think it is important that those who follow in this debate should contribute so that we will have in this country an improvement in the wine industry and add to the knowledge which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs: Given the amount of corruption among the military and others in Indonesia, what guarantee can the Government give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the $250,000 donated to Indonesia for the relief of the Timorese people actually will reach those people, many of whom are reported to be in concentration camps? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is this new phenomenon which has developed which it seems to me ought to be more properly examined by the public at large and by the Parliament without falling back on the simplistic suggestions that this or that sector of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is responsible for the problems we face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> once received two mail deliveries a day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, can the Minister assure the Senate that if an outbreak of a disease such as rabies does occur in Australia, knowledge of its presence will not be hidden from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the last part of the question, which related to knowledge of the presence of this disease in Australia being withheld from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, I am sure that would not be the intention of the Minister for Health, particularly because of his concern to ensure the health of all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The careless use of words very often promotes the wrong attitude and has a negative result for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If this is done, the strength of a democracy is ensured and confidence and pride will return to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make these points because it is important that Australians recognise that the Government ‘s actions in the last two years, both in policy and in practice, have produced real and positive results for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that we are faced with the fact that from the outset this Budget has been a deceitful one and that it has sought to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the strategy which is being followed would be successful in restoring some level of economic growth and would reduce the level of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, this Budget creates real problems for a great many <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The third arm of the conciliation and arbitration system which was promised to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in 1975 and again in 1976 and 1977 has turned out to be the withered arm of the conciliation and arbitration system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are asking, and rightly so: What is our Government doing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever our future might be, honourable senators of the Government and Opposition parties might see in that fact something of a portent for the future, some degree of criticism by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- at least 800,000 of them- of the lack of attention which this Parliament so often gives to the affairs of urgency and necessity of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> cannot allow this situation to continue indefinitely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One must ask: Can the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> look to the Australian Labor Party for creative and effective alternative leadership? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe on present showing, while the Labor Party sits bemused apparently by its ideology and fails to do the necessary job the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are waiting for it to do, that the answer is no. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That job the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are waiting for the Labor Party to do relates to the trade union movement and its place in Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear much talk these days about consensus and the desirability of consulting people, but we do not see any signs of it in practice, nor do we see or hear of” much consultation with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, I suggest from the feedback we in the Australian Democrats are getting, are fed up to the back teeth with this situation and they will not tolerate it any further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So while the Labor Party continues in the public mind to be associated with these extremist groups, and believe me it is associated with them in the public mind, it will not get the confidence of the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I return to the Liberal and National Country parties which make up the Government and which after all bear an immediate responsibility to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be doing something effective about our outmoded Constitution and political system so that members of this Parliament are elected on a basis of representing all Australians, not just half of them, and so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are consulted more adequately and more honestly about their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, and most of all, I plead with the Government to give the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> leadership which will permit them some pride, some spirit and some hope for our common future rather than the present long, endless retreat in disarray. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It states: leave out all words after ‘That’, insert these Bills be not further proceeded with until the Government agrees to submit itself to the judgment of the people, the Senate being of the opinion that the Prime Minister and his Government no longer have the trust and confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because of- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have spoken of only one area of the concern of the Western <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, but there are a number of areas of the Budget which concern me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that is of no consolation to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The feeling of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> was well and truly expressed at the Werriwa by-election last Saturday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that either the Australian Government has been hoodwinked or that it knows the truth and is not prepared to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that in this area, as in any area of Government policy, the Government must be guided by what is in the best interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With respect to the particular matter mentioned by the honourable senator, that is the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> being able to enjoy a reduction in fares and full freedom of choice of air carrier, I agree that they are important considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your petitioners submit that all or any of the foregoing proposed legislation of the Lower House, if implemented, will greatly disadvantage many thousands of citizens as either against their expressed will or not submitted to universal vote as the democratic right of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, therefore, Your petitioners call on the Senate as the House of Review to take appropriate action to release these persons from burdens unfairly placed in order to finance a deficit not of their making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-0-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same time, they will mean that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will be repaying loans from 1981 onwards- that is only three years away- at a rate of nearly $500m a year to the overseas lenders from whom the money has been borrowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also essential to remind the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the situation even on the Prime Minister’s own recent admission is not likely to improve in the next two or three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the first Budget since the introduction of those cuts we are seeing those taxation promises being taken off the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by the present Fraser Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is to be hoped that at the next general election the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will remember the full page advertisements of the previous general election and will realise that the bunch of notes which were shown in that advertisement as being the great inducement to vote for  Mr Fraser  was nothing more than a mirage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My real fear is that, combined with other measures adopted by this Government, the tax surcharge, which may have to remain for at least two years even though the Government has said that it will be imposed for only one year if the economy does not recover, will have an actual and psychological impact on consumer confidence and will comprise the worst Christmas present the Fraser Government has given the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> yet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is time we had incorporated in the Constitution clauses that stop such legislation and I believe a referendum along those lines, especially in view of some of the things contained in this Budget, would be passed quite easily by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe the Government since its election in December 1975 has consistently been responsible to all <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in recognising that if our economy is not well and soundly based then we do not have a country with a soundly based future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I was saying, at no stage did it attempt to justify to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the fact that it had increased the taxation take and would make no move in the direction of reducing the taxation burden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the .<span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will accept that, given the present budgetary situation of the Government, we as citizens can tolerate a slightly higher rate of taxation in the next 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rate is not a high one and the taxation benefits that have been enjoyed by Australians under the Fraser Government are real ones, and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are well aware of this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What may be said about that so-called adventurism is that we sought to borrow sums of money abroad which would have enabled the Australian Government to purchase considerable assets for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether one is entitled to come to the conclusion that Government members are illiterates- that they cannot or do not want to read- or that they simply want to mislead both the Senate and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about this Government’s approach to economic matters, by attempting to concretise the very difficult economic conditions that we are experiencing in this country, by suggesting that it all started in December 1972, and that here we are, three years afterwards, still reeling from the results of Labor’s administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every senator opposite who has spoken in this debate tonight has claimed that this Budget enjoys the confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If senators opposite are so confident about the Bills and so confident that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> support their strategy I suggest that they look at the level of bank savings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why do they not have the courage of their convictions and rhetoric and go to the polls now, as they did a year ago, to see whether their Budget strategy is acceptable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and whether these tax Bills enjoy the support of the people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a government wishes to collect more revenue it has to go before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and increase the tax rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words the Government has had to go before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and say: ‘On this occasion we need additional revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that if the Swedish Government has seen fit to make such a radical change in policy it will be of interest to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and is a matter which I think they would wish to see publicised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the beef producers of Australia and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> ought to know that the Labor Party apparently opposes the idea of a Minister for Primary Industry going to America at this stage to secure beef supplies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that they are insensitive to their responsibilities just as Qantas is quite insensitive to its responsibility to carry out the will of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as reflected in the speeches that have been made in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Chipp  said- and I must agree with him- this is a matter of significance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In effect it is an airline in which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a direct interest and therefore its actions are also of interest and significance to all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But so that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are under no misconception about these broken promises, let us examine some of the promises and statements made by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps one could be excused for believing that a person who could make such a statement would be aware of the utter devastation and despair that is being felt by hundreds of thousands of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who happen to be unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has obviously recognised that to have radical changes to the system, to make rash promises in the income security system, would create expenditure which is not able to be tolerated by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> without some other burden being placed upon them, probably through personal income tax or some alternative taxes to raise revenue for these means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that this will allow the very great majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to feel that there is a substantial income test free pension for those who are 70 years of age and over, and those who are in need will be able to be tested for the increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that that means, among other things, giving the Federal Opposition, which represents about 40 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, full and fair coverage, as well as giving coverage to Government representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an important comment because it draws attention to the different types of creative services that the Australian Broadcasting Commission provides to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as distinct from the sorts of services that the Railways provides, for example. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It cannot be said that the ABC is in disarray; it cannot be said that the ABC is not any longer giving to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> an extremely worthwhile diversity of programs, on both television and radio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, at a time when we were relieving the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of a tax burden we were also expanding and developing the facilities of the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government in adopting a hostile attitude towards the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the service that it provides to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, has made an attack not only on the ABC but also more importantly, an attack on the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party has much to answer for in the way it took up a scheme that had been half worked out by two non-medical doctors, which subsequently became Medibank, and managed to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that this was the solution to all our health care problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is just another example of how the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are learning through bitter experience the amount of trust that they can place on the words of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To counteract this campaign, Treasury should undertake the responsibility of advising the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in just the same way that as a result of the Budget a man earning the average wage, which is in the vicinity of $200 a week, will have to pay an extra $ 1.80 a week for the petrol he uses in his car to take him to and from work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I believe that it is the duty of government to encourage discussion between industry, the unions and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of what our industrial goals should be 10 or 20 years from now so that a reasoned progression can be made towards those goals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been stated already by  Senator Button  that on 25 August 1977, barely a year ago,  Mr Anthony,  when presenting to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the Government’s response to the Ranger Inquiry, stated that recommendation No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These matters relate directly to the very basis of consideration of this Bill which I see as being the flexibility in decision-making in the future in the whole area of nuclear power and the export of uranium so that the decisions may quickly and readily be taken in accordance with the wishes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Much effort is being put into feather bedding the uranium miners, while the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who cannot be called, in  Senator Kilgariff  ‘s words, ‘left wing activists or extremists’ do not want uranium mined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The objective which  Senator McLaren  has in mind in moving these amendments tonight is merely to embarrass the Government supporters who have represented, as have members of the Australian Labor Party, the interests of the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by taking these matters forward to the Federal Government and ensuring that the Government fully recognises the problems in certain parts of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-82-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I must take slight issue with a remark of  Senator Gietzelt  ‘s when he commented on the excellent work which Qantas has done on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is one area to which I shall advert tonight in which I think Qantas is doing a positive disservice to the Australian Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have also expressed to them the very great admiration that the Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have for the reputation which is enjoyed by those people of Greek descent, those people who are Australians in their own right by birth in this country or by accepting Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-104-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fair to say that there is a definite feeling among the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> today that the machinery of government may have become too large and unmanageable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We maintain that resources in the seabed and waters adjacent to Australia are properly thought of and properly to be exploited as Australian national resources, belonging to the whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> without regard to State boundaries or claimed State interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To get back to the words I first uttered when I rose to speak, I said that I wanted to draw the attention of the Senate and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to how the Prime Minister is quite prepared to mislead the electors and to try to hoodwink them into believing that he is the head of an honest government and he is doing all he can to better the living standards of the people who live here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That whereas the facility for citizen initiated referenda exists in many other countries, notably the United States and Switzerland, but does not exist in Australia, and whereas no steps are at present being taken to investigate the ways in which this right could be granted to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners submit that all or any of the foregoing proposed legislation of the Lower House, if implemented, will greatly disadvantage many thousands of citizens as either against their expressed will or not submitted to universal vote as the democratic right of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, therefore, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-0-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thank the Opposition for the opportunity to remind the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, in its wisdom and, I think, with the great support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, decided to maintain the family allowance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government does not honour its promises as it has not honoured its promise in this area it is misleading the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, just as I suggested earlier this afternoon that it misled the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by its inability to provide more employment in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should say to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, ‘We cannot have twice yearly indexation of pensions as we said we would at the 1975 election and the 1977 election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the fact that this more common ground has been achieved has been generally applauded by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly I think it is a bit of a scandal that a report of this nature should be presented to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in this manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators opposite that most of the events provided for participation by the great mass of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were enjoyed by the mass of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no wonder that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are losing faith in political parties and in governments when election promises can be broken so glibly as though they have no value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, in fact, assets were being provided for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, it should not be regarded as a deficit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, of course, is one of the great myths of the thinking of not only this Government but also those who control the media and try to develop the consciousness of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to support that point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, as we know, this is an issue with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Bill defers the provision of a certain amount of money it also draws the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, indeed of the Australian Parliament, because it provides opportunities for extension and support of urban transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From that day I think <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have looked inwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Little thought has been given by <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to ensuring that Australia remains a healthy country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Government is bringing to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the facts of the situation today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For too long <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have considered that we are still a British colony- that we are still attached to the British Isles and to Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This type of nonsense perpetrated on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> has the effect of upsetting and frightening some people and also of leading to rubbish being printed in the daily newspaper columns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Chipp  has said, this matter is very close to the hearts of the Austraiian Democrats, as I believe it is close to the hearts of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The opinion of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is that the Barrier Reef should be protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can prevent them from doing that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it wanted to come clean with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> it would tell the truth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these sorts of deals are going on under the counter what are the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to think? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will ensure that this Government has a change of heart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I then expressed my view that early action should be taken to expedite the implementation of the Act and that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> could be assured that the speculations of this matter are unjustified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Citizen initiative means that the right of making law would no longer be the sole prerogative of members of Parliament but would be exercised through a referendum  when the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> themselves wished to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-What I have said should be clear enough from the lessons of our own history and from the record of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in constitutional referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But perhaps the worst single example of the way in which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have been misled by a totally unscrupulous campaign occurred 12 years ago when some members of the Senate opposed an amendment, which was supported by all the political parties, to abandon the nexus which links the size of this chamber with the size of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that  Senator Mason’s  party and  Senator Chipp  ‘s party would have been aware that there is a vast difference between getting the support of 10 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in an election and getting the support of over half the population, which of course would be necessary at the second stage, the referendum stage, of the citizen initiative system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Together with Russell Rollason of the Australian Council of Churches, they have established an organisation that is respected for its integrity in explaining the Eritrean situation to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without government involvement the market as it now operates is not capable of supporting industrial development and restructuring at the desired rate and with costs acceptable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is not able to do this, it ought to say so to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; it ought to say so to the Parliament and not present a report which indicates that all is rosy, that there is nothing wrong with its policies and in fact - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would hurt a lot of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because we would have to accept a lower standard of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the early days some of us were actively trying to interest the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the problems of the discrimination which was taking place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I compliment our Foreign Minister, not only on his statement but also on the warning he has given the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the world about the problems which were brewing in the Far East. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are being conned into believing that this development will have a marked impact upon the Australian economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not labour intensive in the sense that there can be a significant flow through of money to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Government is playing a cruel joke on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> when it pretends in the face of all this evidence that we will have a uranium bonanza. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pity that Government when it becomes apparent to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that that is not the truth and, of course, time will make that abundantly clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest that the situation is no less than that, I would hope that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> would see it in those terms, because that is the truth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is wrong of the Government to permit this immoral traffic without at least consulting the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Numerous polls in every State have shown a steady and increasing concern by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government has no morality, at least the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have morality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not agree to consult the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Australian Democrats say that this is a proper and responsible subject upon which the Government should consult the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Government was elected by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, it was elected to carry out its vows during its term of office in a responsible way, and I would suggest that does not give it an unfettered right to carry on actions when there is clear evidence of a large degree of dissent from those actions among the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Democrats say: ‘Let the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> decide whether we export our uranium, and let them decide it soon’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, in the case of the Federal Commissioner of Taxation v. South Australian Battery Makers Pty Ltd,  Mr Justice  Murphy demonstrated some of the skills which have commended him to so many <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is the attitude of this Government, then I fear for the future of this Parliament as I do for the future of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> while this Government is in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that he was making a judgment which would not be shared by the majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Whitlam Labor Government did it, firstly, by recognising the important part being played by voluntary organisations in providing recreational outlets for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>; secondly, by providing capital grants for the construction of sporting community recreation and cultural facilities; thirdly, by assisting Australian sports men and women; fourthly, by stimulating an awareness of the benefits of individual fitness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it has also been established to the satisfaction of the promoters of these schemes that 90 per cent of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> now watch television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My real concern is that the very person who is now buying off Australian sport- 1 am talking of Kerry Packer- is endeavouring to convince this Government that it should subsidise the establishment in Australia of a satellite communications system which not only will have the effect of creating difficulties within the communication area but also will present the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a national captive audience in respect of advertising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is wrong for this sort of advertising, which I think is so detrimental to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, to be delivered to a captive audience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will review the great advantages, in the form of more relevant and responsive government accruing to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, of not having Ministers in the Senate, apart from the Leader of the Government in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole purpose of this move is to improve the efficiency and the competence of Parliament and thereby its relevance and value to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that again because, if the system is to enjoy the confidence and respect of the mass of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> it should be in a very real sense bipartisan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is the removal from the minds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the suspicion that ASIO is acting in a partisan manner in the interests of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is not a bipartisan policy on security, if there is a party or a group of parties within Australia representing about half of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who believe that ASIO is not acting properly, that ASIO is a weapon that is being used against them, we will have an ineffective ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have expressed in a variety of ways our concern at the actions of the Queensland Government which have clearly been designed to circumvent the wish of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, as expressed some 12 years ago, that the Commonwealth Government should accept responsibility for our Aboriginal communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Parliament is to make a favourable impression on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, Ministers must have a responsibility to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is not living up to its undertakings to keep the Parliament informed and to take the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into its confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the Government that unless it is prepared to tell the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> just what has happened in the case of these contracts, it is falling down lamentably in its defence program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report expresses the intuitive reaction of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that these kinds of reforms should be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today we have added to the debate on this subject by reminding the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of just how long-running and scandalous a sore this question of misuse of Federal funds has been in the best known context of them all- the use by Victoria of Federal funds for land purchase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The essential part of my terms of reference is: ‘in the light of past experience, and having regard to the security of Australia as a nation, the rights and responsibilities of individual persons and future as well as present needs, to make recommendations on the intelligence and security services which the nation should have available to it and on the way in which the relevant organisations can most efficiently and effectively serve the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and Government . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thereby the necessity for a powerful organisation that can protect Australia’s security and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> can be seen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until our amendments are written into the legislation that is now before the chamber or until the present legislation is withdrawn and redrafted to contain the provisions set out in our amendments, the Labor movement will not be satisfied that the political rights and civil liberties of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are protected by the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is doing no more than make a genuine effort to keep the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> informed on what it is doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The introduction of the Parliament House Construction Authority Bill seems a formality but, in real terms, it will provide a starting point to which <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will look as long as there is an Australia, as long as Australia has a Parliament and as long as Australia has a parliament house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not comply with the provision of ensuring the protection of the civil liberties and political freedoms of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because it is deficient in so many respects including the 1 1 points we have set out in the Opposition ‘s amendment, I suggest that the Senate should support the amendment and demand the withdrawal of the Bill and the redrafting of it to provide for the protection of the civil liberties of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the right of parliament to be informed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we did not try to spring them, just as I feel that this Government will not try to spring a couple of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> now in a Malaysian gaol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the view of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that whaling should cease is overwhelming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fundamental flaw in the legislation now before the chamber is that practically no attempt has been made by this Government to establish any fundamental watchdog procedures that would constrain ASIO within the bounds of the law and within the wishes of the Parliament and of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are those sorts of psychological considerations involved when part time or professional ASIO agents are paid by this Government and this Parliament to operate in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sooner or later the Government has to face up to this issue and go to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and say: ‘We are prepared to govern with courage and a sense of responsibility, but you have got to back us’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So those people who have been trying to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- and I am talking now about the so-called pro-nuclear experts- over a long period that it is for the good of this country that we should mine our uranium are probably amongst the minority of people in the world who are totally dedicated to mining without realising that the safeguards have not been properly carried out, will not be properly carried out and that major accidents may happen around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the great problems of the present Federal Government is that it is not prepared to be frank with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about what it proposes to do concerning the mining of uranium except in respect of those areas where it has already declared itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Keeffe  did not indicate to the people of Australia that it was the Labor Government which committed the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to purchasing an interest in a uranium mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They can justify their claim to these land rights to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate will be aware that recently public surveys showed that a majority of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> support the concept of land rights and Aboriginal people having a control over mining on Aboriginal reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet time and time again they present that point of view in the media of this country in an endeavour to convince the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that mining, as the Australian Mining Industry Council says in this document, is in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> per se. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has seen the benefit of that policy and, on the basis of his own experiences, has seen that those policies were in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government seriously suggest that that is protecting the civil rights and liberties of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are allowing that person to put the great bulk of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> under some form of surveillance and to record their activity on some dossier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that the Government believes that with the full co-operation of the States and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> progress towards lower inflation and interest rates can be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the outset, however, 1 must emphasise that the Commonwealth Government is committed to protect the health and the environment of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, my hackles rise at some of the assertions made in it because they seem to me to be a follow-up to what has been a policy of gradualism in this Parliament over the past year to make the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> believe through several statements, Dorothy Dix questions and the like that even the air they and their children breathe must be foul and polluted in the interests of a spurious, false and rather ignoble cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest it is time that the Government made a statement to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on the subject if only to test the water and to see what the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> feel about the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the correspondence has demonstrated, that incorrect information was provided deliberately, no doubt with the intention of misleading this chamber and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the Opposition will not let up in its attempt to reveal the full story to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ten per cent or even 50 per cent of the truth is as good a way of misleading this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a downright lie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All our proposals to make ASIO more accountable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, because it exercises these extraordinary powers, were rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is very important to understand is that already the effect of our policies has been for the oil companies themselves not only to extend their sphere of exploration but also to exploit existing oil wells far beyond the levels of their former profitability, therefore giving to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> some years extra assurance of oil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has the support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who receive it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a record that should be supported and commended by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am quite sure that if we did not do that we would be recreant in our duties to the Parliament and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this Government hands over total control of that region to the Queensland Government, it will be a total abrogation of its responsibility to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and it must bear the blame for any acts perpetrated on the reef by the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That one of the great natural wonders of this planet should be the play thing of miserable political attitudes and equally miserable commercial interests is evidence that those responsible must stand condemned, not only in the eyes of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but in the eyes of the whole world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have spoken about Government initiatives concerning three matters which identify the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and our nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that he will see something which he feels compelled in conscience to bring to the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No, to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it may be that the Leader of the Opposition would feel compelled in conscience to abandon the usual convention as to secrecy which he would otherwise of course willingly undertake and come into the Parliament and reveal to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what had come to his knowledge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My point is that, by putting into statutory form the convention as to secrecy, one will in no way prevent that from happening should the event which triggered this need that the Leader of the Opposition saw to bring the matter to the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That position ought to be unconscionable not only to the Opposition and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but also to  Senator Missen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With all due respect to  Senator Missen  and others who would like to get this all out of the way in the next 10 minutes, I suggest we are discussing something of rather more importance than that to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3) to raise some matters that are of great importance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> generally and in particular the people of New South <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 suspect that the Government was either embarrassed about the decision to establish the Unit, or it did not want the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to know of its establishment at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only has the Australian Broadcasting Commission’s ability to broadcast sporting matters been taken away from it but also, as a result of the cut in its expenditure and the severe staff ceilings that have been imposed upon it, the news service which it is able to offer to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and which it was offering on a completely independent basis when the Labor Government was in office is in jeopardy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have taken advantage of the second reading debate to raise these matters now because they are of great importance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This did not provide the answer that the Government and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were looking for but a very strong paternal attitude towards the Aboriginal people developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then suddenly the Government, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, decided that the Aboriginal people must be given selfdetermination; that they must be given the right to decide what they want to do and where they want to go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the energy enterprises operating in this country- I did not say ‘of this country’ because they are invariably responsive to foreign voices and not to those of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- want to deal in secret with the Ministers and departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, we have to consider the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I use the expression ‘the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>’ as being inclusive of the people of Norfolk Island in that, for example, each Australian individual or company has to bear a proper share of the taxation burden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the beginning of my speech I said that there was a dichotomy between protecting the interests of the people of Norfolk Island and giving them as much self-government as possible- perhaps more than the Minister for Science and the Environment  (Senator Webster)  would desireand recognising at the same time that the standards which are applicable to the Norfolk Island people should be as far as practicable the same as the standards which are applicable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in matters such as income tax and social welfare legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas a fortunate and dishonest few can obtain the benefit of the tax haven on Norfolk Island, the bulk of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are prejudiced by their activities in so doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, we say that the desirability of encouraging the maximum degree of selfgovernment should be qualified by the very real interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole, including those of Norfolk Island, in relation to tax matters and the provision of certain minimum standards of justice and levels of income such as we seek in this Parliament, in numerous other debates, to guarantee by one means or another to all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second aspect of life on Norfolk Island which must be of concern to this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is the system of social services which prevails- or does not prevail, to state it more accurately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ten per cent or even SO per cent or the truth is as good a way of misleading this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a downright lie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic question which concerns the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in relation to this issue is whether they have a Government in Australia which will allow oil drilling to proceed near the Great Barrier Reef in a manner which would result in damage to the Great Barrier Reef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this Parliament knows full well now that a letter from the Prime Minister of this country will not create a monumental impression on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, does this not represent a major failure in Australia-United States diplomatic relations, one that should be causing very great concern to this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Ryan has referred to a number of matters, but I feel that we cannot look at an urgency debate of this kind without going back to the economic realities which must be faced as a Government puts together both sides of a Budget including the revenue which we extract from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in direct taxation and through other Government charges, the expenditure which arises from the enormous systems of social security and health cover which have been developed, and other matters that have been referred to in the debate today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The assurance given by the Treasurer that the government will maintain the social security payments should enable people to discard entirely what was said by  Senator Ryan  when she talked about a Government deliberately withdrawing social security from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it would be understood that, at a level of $8,000m which is to be spent on social security and welfare, there is not much room in this country for anyone to make wild or elaborate promises, if a reasonable level of tax or other charges on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is to be sustained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To ignore that and to talk of a withdrawal of social services from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> sounds rather ridiculous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have a right to see that there is efficiency in health care as well as the provision of health care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government assures the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it is economically responsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a government in which the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will sustain their confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-The Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  remarked that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not want wild and elaborate promises to be made by governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I remind the Minister that it is the Government of which she is a member that made promises in 1975 and gave undertakings to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in 1 977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that whilst the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> do not want wild and elaborate promises to be made, they certainly want a government which, when it makes such policies, adheres and implements them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government finds that because of its own economic inertia it is not able to implement its policies, the members of the Government are the ones who are answerable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because of this Government’s failure to adhere to its undertakings to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Opposition today has moved a motion attacking the Government’s policy to allow social security and health services to decline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>After his dismal statement in this Parliament last Thursday night, the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  himself went on the airwaves of Australia, on a program called  Nationwide,  with my colleague, the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  and the Treasurer told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in their lounge rooms that this time next year inflation certainly will be no better, and this time next year unemployment will be higher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What did this Government do last Thursday night as far as educational assistance for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> is concerned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It produced a generation of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who thought that there were such things as free lunches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that at the next election the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will have no hesitation in ridding themselves of this promise-breaking, incompetent Government which pursues and defends such manifestly unjust spending priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After last Thursday’s miniBudget and its dramatic imposts on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and with the August Budget yet to come, I believe that the refuges have every right to anticipate that monetary problems of ever greater magnitude than they are presently experiencing will prevail in future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  has already appealed to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to ignore fear-mongering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I believe that when a man assumes the position of leader of the country, by whatever methods he adopted, his credibility has to be sound and accepted by the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, otherwise people will not follow him and we will have divisiveness and worse trouble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When Gough Whitlam was in power he boldly and candidly challenged the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to make sacrifices to go without tax relief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Fraser Government’s creditibility lies in tatters, but the Prime Minister knows the gullibility of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That statement expressed clearly what we were saying when we were in government, and what we said subsequently, and proves that this Government misled the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in respect to the economic difficulties that have beset this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that in 1971-72, because of the mismanagement by the McMahon Government, which could not handle the economic crisis of that period, the world economy was on the downturn and was having its effects upon Australia and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> took advantage of the situation to change the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is about time that the nonsense that has been peddled by this Government and its spokesmen, particularly the Prime Minister, came to an end and we got down to a serious debate about the problems that beset all of the industrialised Western countries and abandoned this type of nit-picking, partisan-type politics, in which we try to convince ourselves that the blame for the country’s problems lies with one party or section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, namely, those who produce the goods and services for the use of their countrymen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What was wrong with spending that money on health and the care of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, on increasing medical services and benefits from $229m to $774m? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, we can go on and on in the areas in which the Labor Government lifted public sector spending to provide the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> with decent conditions and benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the reasons why the Senate today adopted the motion moved by my colleague,  Senator Coleman-  a most unusual event- is that there is a struggle in the Government about maintaining the level of benefits to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now spend more than $ 1,000m per annum in advertising- in trying to convince <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to purchase and to consume more goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It indicates to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that this Government is not carrying out its proper responsibilities so far as its election promises are concerned and so far as its proper economic management of the Australian economy is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All departments and Commonwealth instrumentalities have a great responsibility to the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for the principle of public accountability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For eight, nine or ten years now Senate Estimates committees have been operating for the purpose of eliciting from Ministers and, through Ministers, from senior public servants details of expenditure that are incurred by departments for and on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It concerns me that six questions relating to export controls and contracts, which are of great importance to the Australian Parliament and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, had to be given in writing to the Department of Trade and Resources on the grounds that a suitable officer was not present at the Committee’s hearings to answer the proposed questions orally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention these matters at this stage because I believe they are of great importance to the Committee of the Whole and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator has not had them often enough for the sanity of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Prime Minister, while in Indonesia, raise the matter of the concern that <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are expressing about what is happening in East Timor? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The Treasurer indicated yesterday that information coming to him from Treasury and taxation sources suggested that the size of the deficit might be larger than had been anticipated and he believed that he ought to communicate that information to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter for very great regret that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and even Australian parliamentarians, cannot get the information that is necessary to make informed judgments about the way in which this supremely important institution operates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Puplick  expects us to accept the statements that are made by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  on this issue when he has been proven time and time again to have mislead not only the Parliament but also the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about interest rates, unemployment, inflation and pensions, he is outside the world of reality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1957 the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> voted overwhelmingly to give power to this Parliament in relation to Aborigines, yet this Government has been prepared, in a defacto sense to trade that power to the Queensland Government so far as Aboriginal reserves in that State are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not accept a return to high taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that those statements were accompanied by advertisements on television showing people brandishing fistfuls of counterfeit dollars in front of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words the Government has had to go before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and say: ‘On this occasion we need additional revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fraser Government is seen as a responsible Government which is sticking to its original, most important commitment to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- to right the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a good idea to remind the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of just what taxation was imposed in the last year of office of the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been working to strengthen the life, the vitality and the vigour of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not accept a return to high taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These public authorities are important not only because they perform a function on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> but also because they employ large numbers of people and expend tremendous sums of taxpayers’ money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I now specifically ask the Minister to endeavour to recapture some of the fading credibility that he might be thought to have as a result of his previous evasion of this issue by giving a straight answer to the Senate, to this Parliament and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on the question: Why is it that clause 28 contains in sub-section (2) this full-scale Henry VIII clause which on its face makes it possible for the Executive Government, without coming back to this Parliament except by resort to the regulation disallowance procedure, to denude this legislation of any significant application to the whole range of departments and authorities that come within the statutory description of prescribed Commonwealth authorities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That employment is subject to the needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as conveived by the elected Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> wanted us to do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have said, and the Opposition has said, that they do not want that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has interpreted the attitude of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to be that they do not want high taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, we suggest that the orientation of the current program of transport sector restructuring should be reversed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report shows clearly that his concept is unacceptable to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that not an admission either that his Government has failed accurately to understand the economy and thus mistakenly has misled the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, or that the Government has accurately read the economy and has deliberately misled the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One would hope that, particularly if there is to be any question of oil exploration on, or exploitation of, the Great Barrier Reef, there should be prepared through this mechanism which the Government has provided- the monitoring of international developments- a specific model, available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and to this Parliament, as to exactly what would happen if there were a major oil spill in areas of the Great Barrier Reef in which there are proposals to drill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that the Fraser Government went to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and said that it would reduce taxation, and it so did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister assure the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Taxation Office will undertake a full investigation of these reports that the National Party is obtaining its donations for the Bjelke-Petersen Foundation by encouraging tax avoidance on the part of potential donors? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister also give an assurance that every effort will be made to ensure that donors to the fund make their donations in a way that does not relieve them of their responsibility to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to pay their rightful share of tax? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the circumstances, is it any wonder that, since the Prime Minister’s credibility is at its lowest level since his election in 1975, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have the greatest doubts as to the integrity and genuineness of this man? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The end of the world did not come in respect of our relations with the United States, and there is absolutely no evidence, except in the thinking processes of this Government or of the intelligence organisations, that these sorts of consequences would flow from any attempt by the elected representatives of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to exercise some surveillance, some control and some influence over what we on this side of the House believe ought to be the correct and responsible role of the legislator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let the Liberal Party in South Australia at this coming State election go to the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> on the basis of a State income tax implementing Federal Liberal policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless, the report of that Senate select committee was of very great importance to this Parliament and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to ensure that the publications that are printed by the Commonwealth are made available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> so that they will know what is going on in the affairs of government, we have to make certain that the officers who are charged with this responsibility are remunerated at a rate which they consider sufficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I was the Minister for the Media and this organisation was under my control, the Government of which I was a member endeavoured to make available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the publications that were printed by the Government Printer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These should have been made available to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> through the Australian Government Publishing Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was simply because very few, if any, officers in the Australian Government Publishing Service had the commercial expertise to ensure that these Commonwealth publications got to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this organisation is to function effectively, profitably and sensibly on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> it must be put on a commercial basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend it to the Senate and to the Government and trust that its recommendations will be acted upon in the interests of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purchasing power of the wages of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> depends entirely upon our ability, first of all, to get inflation down in this country and, therefore, to get purchasing power up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a whole will not reject those lectures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only then that he can persuade the Opposition and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that he and the people who will succeed him in his job are serious about that commitment and that these powers will not be used in a thoroughly unacceptable way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is a political exercise to try to show the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that we hate heroin pedlars and therefore we will increase penalties to show that we mean business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government ever considered this matter, which would avoid the great August uncertainty and the subjection of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to speculation by the Press? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to the Senate and to the people who are listening that the debate today is purely a stunt to somehow divert the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in particular from the achievements of the State Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is supported by a large number of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly if the Prime Minister really believes that he has to smarten himself up, then he should explain to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that most of the inflation of the last six months, and certainly the inflation of the next 12 months, will result from Government initiated actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to refer to the programs of the Government and to what can be achieved by the Australian peoplebecause it is a case of the Government using the funds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- in providing these programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he were to look at what had been achieved by the Government through the use of the funds of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> he would see that in four years we have increased our assistance to families from $34 1 m under the last Hayden Budget to $ 1,053m in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To have a paper circulated with those sorts of proposals and to hear the comments of  Mr Hayden  in his speech on the Budget last night on behalf of the Opposition with regard to indexation indicates, I think, that the Labor Party is being less than frank with the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme would have required $ 1,500m a year in addition to the present taxes which are collected from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, he is a product of the Whitlam Government which specialised in the collection of increased taxes from the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But they are not cheap for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am quite confident that that would never have occurred had it not been for the many thousands of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> who signed petitions and had them presented both in this chamber and the other chamber ever since that was taken away in the last Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A completely fictitious set of figures are used purely to hoodwink the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> into believing that the unemployment figures are lower than they actually are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Grimes and others are endeavouring to shout down an answer which is vital to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Budget was presented by a government which has been characterised by a penchant for ad hoc decisionsdecisions which have given the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a succession of different health insurance programs which have never really been fully understood before being superseded, decisions which have taken from the pensioners conditions for which they fought for years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it was elected it regarded itself as the saviour of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to this massive income tax slug or, as my leader  Senator Wriedt  termed it, ‘tax harvesting’, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> now find that they are paying increasing tax each time they step into their cars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The essence of this economic strategy, I submit, is a sustained attack upon the living standards and quality of life of the great mass of the ordinary <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government in its latest Budget has resorted to trickery and subterfuge in its endeavours to try to fool the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and perhaps even the business sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that  Mr Risstrom  did a tremendous job to debunk the theory that  Mr Malcolm  Fraser and  Mr Howard  were attempting to put over that this Budget in fact would be beneficial to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are all aware of the confusion and the concern of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, and their disgust with this Government, as a result of the many changes which have been wrought to destroy the universality of Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These figures show quite conclusively that the payments to government schools in the States and the Northern Territory are down in money terms by $77.3m a year, and no means of trying to camouflage that by talking in terms of constant prices is going to convince this Senate or the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister is prepared continually to mislead the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lawyers and accountants, after having had their education paid for through the public sector, the university system, are not now spending all their time on improving the life styles of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> or on making a contribution to the wealth of this country, but are seeking to distort the incomes of those in the top brackets in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These actions are typical of the con job that this Government has done on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to conduct an industrial campaign- which to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> means turmoil- irresponsibly and against the interests of the community generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to alert the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the fact that we live in a society in which the distribution of wealth and income is grossly inequitable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> unfortunately refused the transfer of those powers from the States to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is exactly where  Mr Fraser  is taking us, and I suggest that it is the last thing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> want to see. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So they should, because if the Commonwealth does not have equitable arrangements with the States, the States will increase State taxation; and that would be detrimental to the overall interest of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a good Budget, a responsible Budget, and its main features, which I have summarised, have led the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to support it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what is before the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> if they are to be dominated by a socialist Labor government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sooner or later the Government has to face up to this issue and go to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and say: ‘ We are prepared to govern with courage and a sense of responsibility, but you have got to back us’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very easy to get up and make a socialist outcry, describing <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as people who have to be protected against themselves, as people who cannot handle their own domestic housekeeping, that some paternalistic socialism of  Senator Gietzelt  ‘s making must come in to protect them against themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party has said: ‘We want you, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, to regard as being of considerable importance- sufficient importance to put aside the business of the Senate for this period- this subject: The increasing cost of consumer credit.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I frequently remind the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, Australia, which had the lowest inflation rate in the free world- an average  2Vi  per cent- moved with its record inflation rate to within the top quarter of all Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That robbed the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> not only of their credit but also of every little pensioner savings account, the millions of small accounts of the savings banks and of the permanent building societies, where the socialist Labor Government through its destructive inflation - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that  Senator Gietzelt  has said is that, in terms of paternalistic socialism, the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are incapable of handling consumer credit themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some 10 days ago when addressing myself to the Budget Papers I was talking of the significance of the wide ranging effects of the 1979 Budget on the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as individuals and groups, on Australia and, beyond that, on nations outside our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly is not the intention ofthe <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at this stage, as they are rising out of many social and economic problems, to return to a situation of doom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 recall, as I look around, that many of the socalled problems that confront this country today, such as an over-supply of cash in the community, are in fact, when analysed, seen to be the problems of recovery and should present a measure of challenge to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, he promised the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> full economic prosperity in three years . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last week the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> were presented with the sixth Budget from this Government and the third Budget from this Treasurer  (Mr Howard),  lt is, in every essential, a graveyard for those promises made almost four years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government might fool some of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> some of the time but they are not so gullible as to believe that when a surcharge that has been imposed is lifted they are getting a greater amount of money in their pay packets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Committee for Human Rights in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe is worried, as we are worried, by the dissidents trial in Czechoslovakia, and has sought to provide information which it hopes will go to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and will bring this matter to full public attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the substitution of noise for ideas is why the South <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> turfed them out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is legitimate for this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to be asking where that money is going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister assure the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that the Taxation Office will undertake a full investigation of these reports that the National Party is obtaining its donations for the Bjelke-Petersen Foundation by encouraging tax avoidance on the pan of potential donors? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister also give an assurance that every effort will be made to ensure that donors to the fund make their donations in a way that does not relieve them of their responsibility to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to pay their rightful share of tax? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You asked  Senator Carrick  to give assurances that a full investigation of those reports will be undertaken and that every effort will be made to ensure that donors to the Foundation make their donations in a way that does not relieve them of their responsibility to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to pay their rightful share of tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister is not prepared to take this action or does not have the power to take such action, will he request the Prime Minister to make a public statement telling the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, particularly those Australians living in remote areas who rely on avgas and distillate for transport and on-going farm activities, the true story regarding supplies of both types of fuel? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government on the United Nations Preparatory Committee and in the Special Session on Disarmament in 1978, does the Government have any plans to mark United Nations Disarmament Week, beginning 24 October, with special activities or the distribution through public bodies of materials informing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the importance of disarmament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that the Government will receive the criticisms that are being made of it today from this side of the House in an objective way- I congratulate the Labor Party on this because our proceedings are being broadcast- for at least the national Parliament is bringing to the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the plight of millions of humanbeings about whom in Australia at the moment sickening apathy is being held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this discussion does nothing more today than awaken the conscience of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> listening, who will lobby their members of Parliament and their senators to take more urgent and realistic action about the suffering people of Indo China, it will have succeeded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government opposes the motion moved by  Senator Button,  the Government has abdicated all claim to the respect of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since November 1975 the present Prime Minister on numerous occasions has lectured this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about propriety in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ten per cent, or even SO per cent of the truth is as good a way of misleading this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a downright lie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more important statement among the lectures to this Parliament and to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about propriety came from the then Prime Minister on 8 August 1978 after he and other senior Ministers, including  Mr Ian  Sinclair and Peter Nixon, had carefully considered the determinations of the McGregor Royal Commission which ultimately made a finding against  Senator Withers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst supporting and applauding the humanitarian reasons behind this appropriation, I think that it is timely to draw attention to the magnitude of the task that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have assumed in servicing social welfare policies which now total yearly nearly $9,000m- 9.6 per cent more than last year’s outlay- and representing more than 28 per cent of all Federal Budget expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ten per cent, or even 50 per cent of the truth is as good a way of misleading this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as a downright lie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, given the brutal and ruthless inhumanity of both sides in this communist civil war, how can the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> be assured that aid, government or nongovernment, actually reaches the civilian population in greatest need? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That certainly is a responsibility of the Government and the Minister to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Twelve months after he gave that explicit undertaking to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>  Mr Newman  announced that the Commonwealth Government would maintain support for the activities of the Corporation by providing $21m in loan funds under the existing financial agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He will help to refresh the memories of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> about the disastrous record of the Whitlam Government, which he supported, in its attempts at overseas borrowing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was clearly that perception of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> at that time which brought about a change of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind him that the latest gallup poll figures show that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> are fed up with the constant hoodwinking to which they have been subjected by Ministers of this Government on the subject of unemployment, on the subject of inflation and on the subject of overseas borrowings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition, because of its concern and because of the concern of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, has raised for discussion as a matter of public importance the implications of the Fraser Government’s record levels of overseas borrowings, borrowings which since this Government came into office have reached a staggering amount of over $5,000m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me also remind the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the members of the Government what the situation is likely to be if the Government continues on this mad course it is engaging in merely to prop up the value of the Australian dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Leave out all the words after ‘That’ insert: this Bill be not further proceeded with until the Government agrees to submit itself to the judgment of the people, the Senate being of the opinion that the Prime Minister and his Government no longer have the trust and confidence of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> because of- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One wonders whether  Mr Anthony  is now aware of the fact that just over 30 per cent of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> have any confidence in the present Prime Minister and about 40 per cent have confidence in his Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What action is proposed, if large quantities of Avgas are to be used in the peacetime exercise Kangaroo III, to cancel the aerial segment of the exercise to conserve the diminishing supplies of Avgas, and, if no action is proposed, will the Minister request the Prime Minister to make a public statement giving the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, particularly those Australians living in remote areas, who rely on Avgas and distillate for transport and on-going farm activities, an accurate description of the situation regarding supplies of both types of fuel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am confident that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> will not be fooled and will not give the Australian Labor Party the opportunity to carry out such unfortunate threats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Certainly, I would agree that any proposition to abandon tariffs in Australia is unreal and irrational because the fundamental point is that, no matter how much money we earn from mining and mineral exports, from primary production- beef, wool and wheat- and all the other great things that we do, we will always be reliant upon manufacturing industry to provide creative and satisfying employment for the great majority of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it is opportune at this time that I remind the Senate that the controversy over Bill Toomer arose back in 1973 when he drew the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to the inadequacy of the Quarantine Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our primary industries, let alone the health of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, are of enormous consequence to our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the light of the economy and in the light of the issues before the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and the union movement, it would be a good thing to adjourn this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The result is a disaster for the whole of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>- trade unionists, employers and the whole cross-section of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This legislation before the chamber tonight is further evidence that my Government is prepared to fight for the rights of the individual and the rights of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to be able to go about their way of life- I quote from the legislation- free of any:  substantial adverse effect on their safety, health and welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>True, the state might have a victory, but it would be a pyrrhic victory at terrible cost to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, one for which the authors of the Bill would bear ultimate responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have had  Sir John  Moore making representations to the Government, and  Sir Richard  Kirby, a most highly respected former  president  of the Commission, has given advice to the Government, the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is not game to go to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and ask for the power to set wages; it knows what the Australian electorate would say in a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Events within our area of the world have produced a renewed thinking on the part of <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> as to where the Australian population situation goes from here and the kinds of people who shall comprise the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that although the tragedy which is now being played out in the South China Sea is disturbing the complacency of many <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, there is no need for us to be unduly frightened of it; rather I think we are being challenged to face a reality that has always been there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is confident it has the full support of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in its expeditious handling of this pressing humanitarian issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Government assure the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Can the Government assure the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that it would not allow itself in any way to be party to the kind of oil blackmail suggested by the Palestine Liberation Organisation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that these are issues which are not ones that command, perhaps, a great deal of interest or wide interest within our country, but I put it to the Government that more could be done to make the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> aware of the enormous dangers that are evident and that are with us all the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind honourable senators that in 1975  Mr Fraser  was elected because he promised the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> that only under a Liberal government would there be jobs for all who wanted to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to the Government and particularly to  Senator Peter  Baume that, when an Opposition feels that its rights are being whittled away and that it is not getting a fair go in its presentation of matters to the Parliament, it has not only a right but also a responsibility on behalf of the section of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> whom it represents to adopt the attitude of opposition to motions of this nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the putting down of an amendment provides a good opportunity to express to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> what the policy is, how this compensation for erosion by inflation would be interpreted, and whether it would be interpreted to cover all families and all children at a cost of $330m in a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have to say that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>, having accepted that sort of responsibility, are entitled to believe that governments will show responsibility in what they introduce in each Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the active role played by the Australian Government on the United Nations Preparatory Committee and in the Special Session on Disarmament in 1 978, does the Government have any plans to mark United Nations Disarmament Week, beginning 24 October, with special activities or the distribution through public bodies of materials informing the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the importance of disarmament ? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-71-5">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems passing strange to me that  Mr Hayden,  through the local newspaper in Ipswich, took me to task because I was bringing to the attention of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> the fact that the Prime Minister of the day was not prepared to listen to me when I sought an interview with him to convey to him the messages that I had brought back from the people of East Timor to the Australian Government, is now supporting the kinds of th’ lgs that I was asking for at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He did not open his mouth on it because he did not want the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> alerted to the real intention of the Fraser federalism policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>I believe that neither of those is an effective solution; neither of those brings us to the position of providing an adequate protection of the rights of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in the 1 980s and beyond. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is because the Bill does not reach into State jurisdiction which is where it needs to reach if it is to do most good for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and indeed which the Covenant demands of this Government, that we oppose the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us warn the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of what will happen to them if the Labor Party is returned to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of them give glimpses of what is in store for the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> if the Labor Party taxation proposals ever come into effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, the history of waste management policy as far as this Government is concerned has been one of great deception of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are aware that there is a conflict here between the policies of the Parliament and the policy of the Government and there is reluctance on the part of the States, including the Northern Territory Government, to accept the overwhelming view of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that there is much to be done in presenting these issues sympathetically to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the Government regards the sending of forces overseas as of very great significance to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> both with regard to the safety and security of those forces and in terms of the international involvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We regard these amendments as important and we hope that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> regard them as important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the total thing was an exercise in cynical disregard of the real needs of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many wealthy international combines have come to this nation to exploit it and very few plums or benefits have been given to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have betrayed the heritage of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> which I believe in itself is a disgrace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier tonight, as  Senator Hamer  took honourable senators on an esoteric visit through the various sections of cloud-cuckoo land, the thought was running through my mind that if the Ayatollah Khomeini were running this country the eyes of the members of the Government would be taken out because of their blind sins of commission, their tongues would be cut out for the lies and half truths that they have told the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and their hands would be cut off for the way they had dipped into the pay packets of the wage earners through increases in living costs and inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find that year by year the great advantages that should be flowing to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> by way of expanding standards of living and greater employment opportunities are being skimmed off and are going into the pockets of people who reside overseas and who have a continuing vested interest, as long as we are locked into the capitalist economic system, to sit wherever they wish in the boardrooms of Geneva or of New York and to manipulate the colonial or developing countries so that their resources will flow into such a small area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If consideration is to be given to the fact that the Timorese have always regarded the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> in high esteem, as friends to be trusted and protected, as vastly demonstrated during W.W.2 when many were tortured and killed by the Japanese because of their loyalty to the Australian commandos, one can not help but sympathise with the resentment that is beginning to surface. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Martin  on our behalf was able to express to the Prime Minister the appreciation of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> for the very generous efforts which the Government of Thailand is making in assisting the refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this company that has been named in another place in another State is in fact engaged in drug running, it serves the Government right, but the Government owes more than that to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister agree that the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> should not have to wait for more than 30 years to have a thorough appraisal of the nation’s participation in major military operations which involved the sacrifice of hundreds of Australian lives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us consider that it will cost the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> a certain amount of money and that the people who will eventually sit there are appointed to work there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that constantly there is room to remind the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> of the unethical and, indeed, immoral practices of people who seek to frustrate the public revenue and therefore to hurt those around them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s resources belong to the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bringing foward of such legislation would, in fact, enable this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> to make a reevaluation of the performance of the Australian Federal Police three months hence in order to reach conclusions to our own satisfaction, and not just to the satisfaction of the AttorneyGeneral, that the Australian Federal Police is, in fact, an organisation of quality, competence and integrity-conclusions which it is just not possible to draw on the state of the evidence at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>In keeping with the humanitarian interest of the <span class="highlight">Australian people</span> and our obligations to the United Nations, the Australian Government is concerned about the detention of people for political reasons and other infringements of human rights wherever they may occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-110">[More…]</a></li>
